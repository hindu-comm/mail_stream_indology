I am sure that my telephone number for Harry is out of date. I am
surprised that you are having trouble with his email address. I was
successfully communicating with him up until a couple of days ago at
FALK at DFRRUF1. He mentioned to me in his last communication that he
would be "out of station" for a few days, maybe a week.
