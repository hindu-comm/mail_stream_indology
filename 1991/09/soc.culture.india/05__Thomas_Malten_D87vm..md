i would like to have a look at a list called
?soc.culture.india on usenet, but don't know how to reach it.

i also dug out from the old logs on the indology list references to
a Sanskrit Text Archive and would like to know the state of affairs.
we are collecting materials for a Tamil Text Archive and could profit
from previous experience (i have seen the report on the STA conference 1988).
