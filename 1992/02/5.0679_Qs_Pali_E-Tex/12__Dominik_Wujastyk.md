The appended query about Pali texts appeared on the HUMANIST discussion
today.  If you can help, contact the author directly -- and perhaps
send a copy to us in INDOLOGY, since I for one don't know the exact
status of the e-text of the Pali canon.

A student of mine is searching for e-texts in pali language. She already knows
of Mahanidesa (OTA holdings), and would like to know which exactly is the stand
ard dor ASCII transcription of pali.
Thank you.
