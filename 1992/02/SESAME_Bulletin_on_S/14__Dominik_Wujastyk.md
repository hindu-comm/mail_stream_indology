I had a note from John Clews today, asking me to pass on the following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Volume 5 of SESAME Bulletin will have a major focus on South Asian scripts
in most issues.

Also, he is advertising a book:

Computer Projects, 1992).  254 pp.  ISBN 1-873091-01-X.  20 pounds.

>From the blurb:  ... the definitive guide to multilingual and
foreign language products for IBM PCs and compatibles.  It includes details
of nearly 300 products, supporting as many languages, which are available
in over 70 countries from over 1000 manufacturers,
publishers and affiliates. ...

My experience of SESAME publications in the past is that they are
very informative.
