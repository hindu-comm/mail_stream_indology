Dear Marsden,
Your friend should begin his study with a thorough investigation of
David Pingree's "Jyotihsastra.Astral and Mathematical Literature,"
Wiesbaden, Otto Harrassowitz, 1981 [A History of Indian Literature, 6.4].
This should provide all the information needed to begin a more detailed
study of the subject. Good luck!
K.G. Zysk
