Well, no helpful variants from the crit. ed., unfortunately.  Nor
from the collation with the "Saaradaa MS, nor from the addenda
and corrigenda.  We are faced with what we've got.  So I reckon
the verse has to mean "... wherever I go, may I meet good people..."
where gataya.h is in apposition to santa.h.  Gati can mean refuge,
resource, according to MW (ref. Manu, Ramayana ...).
