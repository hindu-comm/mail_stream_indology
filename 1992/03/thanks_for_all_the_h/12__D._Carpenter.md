Just a note of thanks to all those who offered assistance
on my Mahabharata translation question, especially to
Dominik and Richard.  I see now that the lack of clarity
was in my own mind, not in Van Buitenen's translation
(no big surprise there!)  gati has quite a range of
meanings, including Van Buitenen's "shelter," as Richard's
citation from Apte's Practical Sanskrit-English dictionary
made clear.

Thanks again for the help.

David
