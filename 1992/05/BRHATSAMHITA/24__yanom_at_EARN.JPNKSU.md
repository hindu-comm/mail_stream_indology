Dear Dominik, Thank you very much for your information
about PANINI PACKAGE.  I downloaded it and one of my
colleagues helped me to unzip (or melt?, I do not know
technical term) the binary text.  In return I want to
send you a floppy disk containing the text of
Varaahamihira's Brhatsamhitaa which I have digitalized.
You can use it whichever way you want.  Michio YANO.
