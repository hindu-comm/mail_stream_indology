Dear Richard Marsden, Thank you for forwarding Ramachandran's letter
to me.  I understand the difficulty he faces of obtaining the papers
published outside India.  I am willing to send some of my papers and
the copies of those papers which I have collected directly to Rama-
chandra.  Please convey my willingness to him.  I would like to have
direct contact with him.  I share with him the admiration of Dr. K.V.
Sarma whom I personally know well.  My mailing adfdress is:
    Prof. Michio YANO, International Inst. of Linguistic Sciences,
        Kyoto Sangyo University, Kamigamo, Kita-ku,
        Kyoto, 603 Japan
