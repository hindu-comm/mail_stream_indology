Dear Indology discussion list,

mail, as only this one notice will be generated.  The following
is a prerecorded message, sent for iwml


Apologies to anyone trying to reach me during the past six weeks. With a
combination of outside duties and a negotiation with our Computer Unit over
storage quotas, I ghave been effectively out of circulation.

That now continues! I am off to Israel until the beginning of June.

Your mail will be stored to be handled on my return.

Thank you for making contact.

Ian (Mitchell Lambert)
