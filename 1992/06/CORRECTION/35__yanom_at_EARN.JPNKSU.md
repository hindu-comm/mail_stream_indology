I am glad to know that, thanks to the kind
effots of Dominik Wujastyk and Thomas Ridgeway,
the Brihatsamhita I and my student have prepared
is now available to the INDOLOGY networkers.
In my brief note to the digitalized text I made
a mistake.
   Instead of <Members of sandhi is not separated>,
   please read <Members of samAsa is not separated>.

One more thing. Please remember that we have not
distinguished between nazals of guttural, palatal
and dental classes.  They are all <n>.
Exmaple:
       kRSNapancamyAM gangAyAM snAtaH.

(In the standard Kyoto-Harvard method, the line is
 transcribed as <KRSNapaJcamyAM gaGgAyAM snAtaH>)

Since we are continually improving the text, please
send me a note if you find any mistake.  We hope we
can offer a fourth version soon.
