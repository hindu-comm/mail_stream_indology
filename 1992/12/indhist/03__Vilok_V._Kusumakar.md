I have heard of uudecode/encode but not XXencode ? My workstation
running HP-UX 8.0 does not have it. I tried uudecode but it doesn't
work. What is XXencode ? Where can I get XXencode from ? Also I
don't have zip/unzip.

Can somebody also get indhist converted to uuencode + compressed ?

I thought these are the two more commonly available mailing and
compression programs.
