if I recall it properly the head was subject of a question on this list
about a year ago, the question was put by Johannes Bronkhorst. The head
is shown in an article by probably the same author Dom mentions in one
of the latest issues of the Journal of Indo-European Studies (JIES). I am
not an art historian, but dating this thing earlier than the beginning of
the current millennium would be absurd. It is quite some time now I read
the JIES article, but I still remember the reaction: the author(s) is
either completety out of his mind or an impostor. The complete lack of
secondary literature in the article and the (seemingly) false claim to
have a reputed institute (does it exist, Peter?) backing his datings make
the second solution more likely.

Subject: LOC ARREARAGES PROGRAMS

          The  request  for  possible contract employees  for processing of 
          arrearages in  the custody of  the Southern Asia Section  of  the 
          Library  of Congress which  I  sent  out  last  week  on  several 
          networks has produced a  number  of  replies relating to Tibetan. 
          Any enquiries about Tibetan should go  to the Reference Librarian 
          for Tibet, Susan Meinheit.  Her email address is                  
          MEINHEIT at MAIL.LOC.GOV. 

             Please note also  that  the messages referred to  two separate 
          matters.  First sent out was a notice of a junior fellows program 
          meant primarily for  graduate  and undergraduate students, though 
          not limited to them.   This  is still open; deadline March 1.   I 
          can fax the information package to interested persons. 

            The second message was  an emergency one  for possible contract 
          employees, a non-competitive program.  We had a deadline of a few 
          hours  but  were  able  to  find  available  candidates  for  two 
          projects.  We have no  news  on whether they were accepted; there 
          was  much competition for  a relatively small  amount  of  money. 
          THIS PROGRAM IS CLOSED, but we have put volunteers or suggestions 
          into a file for future reference. 

            By the way, LOC can accomodate volunteer, unremunerated work on 
          arrearages, e.g. cataloging  mss collections.  These  don't  look 
          bad on a bibilography or c.v. 

          Allen Thrasher
