Is there any material archived (tranliteration, translations etc) from
or of Kautilya's arthashaastra?  AAlso could anyone recommend a
relatively recent translation which has both the sanskrit and english
printed alongside? (my only refernce for an english translation is  a
1956 edition of Dr. R Shamasastry's "Arthasastra"). Thanks for any
response.
