Dear Lowell,

At SOAS in London, Cathleen Taylor has been researching Sir John Woodroffe,
and the Arthur Avalon question.  She has solved this very interesting
question (to my satisfaction at least) after extensive research in Calcutta,
and the discovery of documents, and indeed members, of the family of
the Indian scholar with whom Woodroffe worked.  The whole matter of her
discovery is fascinating and was presented at one of the Hindu Studies
Seminars at SOAS last year.  Cathleen's paper will be published in a book
of collected papers from that seminar series currently being edited by
Julia Leslie.

Cathleen can be reached by post c/o the History Dept., SOAS, Thornhaugh
Street, Russell Square, London WC1H 0XG, or by phone at +44 71 381 1168.
