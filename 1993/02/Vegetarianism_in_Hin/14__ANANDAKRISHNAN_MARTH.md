Are you interested in cookbooks or books about ethics and vegetarianism or 
does it have to be connected with Hinduism?  Diet for a Small Planet (
Frances Moore Lappe) has recently been updated and is a great sourcebook 
for all kinds of facts about eating ethically.  I have a cookbook called 
Lord Krishna's cuisine by Yamuna Devi.  It's a wonderful book for Indian 
recipes, though I have to add garlic and onions to everything...and lots 
more chili.  Let me know your more specific interests.  I'm one of those 
tiresome vegetarian evangelists, if you know what I mean.
