          Re:  Tracts just offered. 

          The  tracts  I  just  offered  have  all  been claimed, with  the 
          exception of: 

          TAMIL 

          Evil practices, or, sins among the gods. 

          There were  8 copies of this, which  I forgot to mention.  7  are 
          still available.
