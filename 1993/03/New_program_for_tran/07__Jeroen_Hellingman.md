Hi Dominic,

You may be aware of the program tcs, which translates character sets
via Unicode. At the moment it understands the
ISO standard character sets, the major East-asian character sets and Unicode.

it is available for ftp from research.att.com

It does not do transliterations, but it can easily be extended to do so.


Jeroen
