I have just uploaded two new files for general access.  At present these
files are available for anonymous ftp from
   ftp.bcc.ac.uk
in the directory
   pub/users/ucgadkw/indology

The files are:

1/ Vagbrasa.zip
   The first five and a bit chapters of the Rasaratnasamuccaya of
   Vaagbha.ta.  This is an alchemical text.  Here is the readme file:

rrs.dn  is the machine readable transcription of the Rasaratnasamuccaya,
        up to 5.23.  Transliterated using the 7-bit scheme of Frans Velthuis.

rrs.ps  is a PostScript image of the 42 pages of the text, ready to print
        on any PostScript printer.

>From the header file of rrs.dn:

% The Rasaratnasamuccaya of Vaagbha.ta: machine readable transcription,
% based on the Anandaa"srama Sanskrit Series edition, vol. 19,

2/ iass.zip
   This is a newccopy of iass.zip.  The only change is that I have
   added the file charset.ps, a PostScript version of the charset.tex
   file after processing with TeX.  This should make it more easily
   available to people with PS pri
ters (just copy the file directly
   to the printer).  There are some tricky characters in the file,
   and anyway, not everyone has TeX (extraordinarily enough).

These two files will be forwarded to the INDOLOGY listserv in due
course so that those of you without ftp can order the files by
email.

[Incidentally, you may have noticed that I am naming archives of text files
by using the first four letters of the author's name followed by the first
four letters of the title.  This is one of the search keys used by the OCLC
library cataloguing system, and it is surprisingly effective in narrowing
down the book required.]
