Dear indologists,
Does anyone know of articles offering a critical assessment
of Heinrich Zimmer and his approach to Indian iconography/
iconology? I am interested also to know of any work on the hermeneutical
questions involved in interpreting Indian imagery.
Thanks.  Noel Salmond     bgoy at musicb.mcgill.ca
