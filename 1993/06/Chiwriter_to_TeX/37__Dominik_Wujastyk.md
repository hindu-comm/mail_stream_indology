Ken,

I noticed that the Chiwriter to TeX program is freely available on the net.
Try the site ftp.tex.ac.uk, in directory pub/tex-archive/support, I think.
The site ftp.tex.ac.uk supports Gopher, and that gives you easy access and
searching.  I had a brief look at one of the docs for the program, and it
looked as though it was highly configurable, and could deal with fonts
intelligently.  You may be in luck.

Dominik
