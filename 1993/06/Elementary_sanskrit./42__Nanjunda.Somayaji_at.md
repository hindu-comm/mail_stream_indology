Hello,

I need the same info. I have studied sanskrit during my school/college days
and have some introduction to this language and literature. Please put me
in the "CC" list if you have any suggestions for Narain Attili request.

Thanks

Hello,

I would like to learn sanskrit. Could anyone recommend good "starters"
books to me..I would further like to have the intermediete level books
too..(ie., the stage next to "starters". I do have some sanskrit
vocabulary..Telugu being my native tongue.).

Thanks,

Narain Attili.
