On behalf of my Sanskrit student Nikolai Saeverud, I am looking for an
indologist with knowledge of classical Indian music theory. Mr. Saeverud,
who is a musicologist, is going to write a thesis on sound as an aesthetic
phenomenon in hinduism. If anybody would like to give him advise and
assistance, please write to me, and I'll pass the name and address on.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
