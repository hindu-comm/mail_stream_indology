Yes.  It is called CSX, and is an 8-bit extension to ASCII.  It was defined
by a panel of interested Indologists who gathered for the purpose at the
last World Sanskrit Conference in Vienna, organized by the Int. Assoc. of
Sansk. Studs. (IASS).  A description is available in the file IASS.ZIP,
which is available from the INDOLOGY listserv or by ftp from
ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology.

Best wishes,

Dominik
