Outline (Postscript type1 and truetype) versions of Washington
Romanized Indic Roman, Italic, and Bold are now available for 
anonymous ftp from blackbox.hacc.washington.edu in the directory
pub/indic/outlines

See the README file in that location.  These fonts are suitable for
use in environments such as Windows 3.1, Macintosh System 7, or wherever
Adobe Type Manager is in use.  Possibly they might be used with the upcoming
MS Word v.6 and WordPerfect v.6, who knows? 

cheers,
Tom
