Hi,

Could someone please give me the sanskrit version of this verse from
the Chandogya Upanishad ...

Tranquil, let one worship it
                As that from which he came forth,
                As that into which he will be dissolved,
                As that in which he breathes.   (Chandogya Upanishad 3.14.1)

Thanks,

---Vipul

(Thanks SATYAVO at WVNVM.EARN for answering my previous question)
