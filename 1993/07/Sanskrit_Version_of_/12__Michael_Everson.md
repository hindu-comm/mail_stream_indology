Cha/ndogyopanis/ad 3.14.1:

sarvam/ khalvidam/ brahma tajjala/niti s+a/nta upa/si/ta.
atha khalu kratumayah/ purus/o yatha/kraturasmim/lloke purus/o
bhavati tathetah/ pretya bhavati sa kratum/ kurvi/ta.

This was translated by Swa/ha/nanda as:
  Verily, all this universe is Brahman. From Him do all things
  originate, into Him do they dissolve, and by Him are they
  sustained. On him should one meditate in tranquility.
  For as is one's faith, such indeed one is; and as is one's
  faith in this world in this world, such one becomes on
  departing hence. Let one, therefore, cultivate faith.

He says that "tajjala/n" is a compressed expression, with
"ja", "la", "an" standing for the verbal roots "jan", "li/",
"an" denoting origination, dissolution, and continuation of
existence.
