Sitting quietly on princeton.edu in /pub is a file called
latextibetan.tar.Z which contains a simple 300dpi bitmap-based system
for typesetting Tibetan with LaTeX.  There's a preprocessor that lets
you type a sensible input coding, and takes care of the fiddly bits you
don't want to worry about.

No MF files, but TFMs and PK files at 300dpi.  Looks very good on a 300
dpi laser printer, and might even stand up at higher res, since Tibetan
is made of thick, calligraphic strokes.

Hats off to the implementor, Jeff Sparkes.  Was it really done
as long ago as 1987?  Why didn't word get out?

All the best,

Dominik

NB to use this you need to have the free typesetting system TeX installed.
