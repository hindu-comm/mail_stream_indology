        Reference: The recent request from Devendra.Singh at si.sintef.no for 
information on the history of development of Indian food.

        There are several articles written by Parashuram Krishna Gode on
the history of individual food items.  These are included in the five
volumes of his collected articles (some published by the Bharatiya Vidya
Bhavan, Bombay, and some by the Vishveshvaranand Indological Research
Institute, Hoshiarpur).  
        Professor Wilhelm Rau, Indisch-ostasiatisches Seminar, Philipps
Universitaet, 3550 Marburg, Federal Republic of Germany, should be able to
provide much information on the Sanskrit and Mixed-Sanskrit manuals on food
making.
