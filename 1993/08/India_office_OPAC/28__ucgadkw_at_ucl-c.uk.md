That's not quite fair to the Bod.  The Bod has a venerable set of
catalogues going back to the time of Thomas, including the Indian
Institute.  Finding something was always rather complicated, since
some catalogues were cards, others books, and so forth.  But it was
(mostly) catalogued, if you had the patience and help from staff.
