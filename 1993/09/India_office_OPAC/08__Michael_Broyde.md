I will get back to you next week.  This logon process is not simple.  I will tr
y to write it out in simple English.  I had a baby last night and I got no slee
p, and I am runnng off to teach my 10 and 12 oclock classes, so I am wiped out.
  I hope this can wait until after labor day.  I will do it on labor day, and s
peak to you on Tuesday.  Sorry.
