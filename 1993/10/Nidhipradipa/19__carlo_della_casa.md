Does anyone have news of work being done on the Nidhipradipa which, according
to the Novissimus Catalogus Catalogorum, seems to be a condensation of the Ni-
dhipradipika, part of the Kakshaputa(or ti)/Kacchaputa/Kaksyaputa/-tantra?
One of my students is attempting an Italian translation, but our bibliography
here is very very scarce.
