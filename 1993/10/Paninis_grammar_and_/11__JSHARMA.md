 Not any more sloppier than assuming Paninian grammer cannot be based 
on Boolean logic, without clearly stating why other than vague 
references to a percieved "climate". Not scholarly or scientific at 
all ...

 What is absolute in science is method, a match between hypothesis 
and evidence; Scientific priority is value based and hence 
subjective. Therefore these statements are quite ad hominem, just as 
much as the claims they purport to debunk !
