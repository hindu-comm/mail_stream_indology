You will need a lot more than the "Help" provided by LISTSERV to search 
the archives.  You also need to study the "LISTDB MEMO" from "info 
DATABase" and the "Commands-Jobs" memo.  Even then, you will need to 
learn how to create and execute acceptable "jobs".

Also, if a person is no longer (or never was) on the list, then REVIEW 
will not have a listing.  Sometimes asking others on the list is the 
most efficient way to get the information.  There are other ways, though:
some of the internet menu-driven search systems, such as Vironica, have
means to search globally for a person if you know the name and the location.
