I had meant to write Bala Swaminathan long back, but an ELM
screwup deleted my received box.  Could someone provide me with
his email address?


Thank you kindly.

PS I check email weekly at most now.

          Would any library like  the following Marathi books which I  will 
          donate if I get an acknowledgement for tax purposes: 

          Gokhale, Vi. Na. 
          Pakshi vijnana 
          Pune: Anatha Vidyarthi Grha Prakasana, 1967 

          Medhekara, Janardana Sankara 
          Kitaka-paricaya, Bhaga 1 la 
          Pune:Citrasala Presa, 1930 

          Kolhatakara, Balakrshna Sridhara 
          Kitaka-paricaya, Bhaga 2 la 
          Pune: Citrasala Presa, n.d. 

          Graba, Sailaja Rabarta 
          Maharashtratila vanyaprani 
          Mumbai: Maharashtra Rajya Sahita Samskrti Mandala, 1978. 

          I'd  give them  to  LOC  but  they  are outside the scope of  our 
          policies.  They  might  be  of  some  use  in  language teaching, 
          however.
