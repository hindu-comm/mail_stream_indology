Rosane, I was just sending you a book review. However I do agree that it
was too long, and perhaps it was "political". 

While I do not like the idea of this kind of censorship, I will certainly
refrain from posting this kind of stuff. The truth can wait. I am sure
that once the political equations in India change, many future
indology-netters will do their Ph.D on topics like this one. So these
issues will come back, while we pretend they do not exist.

Subject: Etymology of the word Devalaka
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

The word Devalaka was applied to a Temple Priest in olden times. I
have not seen it being used for any temple-priests these days. Does
anyone know any priests in India these days who call themselves
devalakas? Also can anyone suggest an etymology of this word?
