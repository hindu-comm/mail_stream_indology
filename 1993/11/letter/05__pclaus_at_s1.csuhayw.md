#Dear Professor Pollock,
#what a pleasure to receive your letter. How are you? I hope
# you have a better time now. I wander how you can manage all
# things you manage. Time in this society is also much
# shorter than anywhere else.
#
#So, we will not meet in Australia! But, have you already
# planned to come here?
#
#Thank you for what you repeated to me. The news y o u  s a i
# d you could not find anybody "good enough"  for the
#Sanskrit  position in your University is another typical lie
# from, I guess, the usual people (whom we know). (Divide et
# impera!)
#
#I am concentrated on this autumn like a huntig dog scenting
# its game. I try to go at least once a week to the
# countryside or to parks, to walk in woods. But when there
# is not light anymore, I can not do nothing but smell my
# friendly Mediterranean sea and its warmth, my colours, the
# wanderful confusion of our streets and squares.
#
#I will send my new article on striidharma, a little bit
# long, almost 70 pages, but I hope not too boring. I know
# you do not have time, but your opinions are well accepted!
#
#This is my first time I write by computer; I hope to have my
# personal line soon.
#
#Insomma, sembra molto difficile incontrarsi. Ci riusciremo
# prima o poi?
#Cari saluti-

Subject: Temple Priests
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I have been working on the temple priests of Maharashtra for some
time now. These priests are called GURAV.They also call themselves
Devalaka brahmins.The Devalaka myth comes from the Shivapurana.
Devalakas are considered to be inferior Brahmins,probably due to the
fact that they accept remuneration for their services.Actually the
Marathi Brahmins call the Gurav "Shudras".I have traced the Gurav
back to Karnataka where they are called Goravas.
If you are not sufficiently confused yet,let me continue. In trying
to relate the Gurav to Goravas, Devalakas, Temple-worship and their
current status as Shudras in Maharashtra, I have to find answers to
the following questions:  1] References to Shudras being custodians
of Idols in the distant past. 2] Early history of Shaivism and the
way it coalesced with Aryan\Brahminic religion, 3] References to
Devalakas between 200 AD to now, 4] Early history of Kalamukhas{who
were called Goravas}, 5] the origin of the Jnansamhita of the
Shivpurana 6] The status of the temple priests in other parts of India
Can anyone help?
