Correction to my earlier posting on the book on Chinese communities in Calcutta:
it is by Ellen OXFELD (not Oxfield). My apologies for the typo.    David Magier

David,
Thanks for the news on this book.  I had completely missed it on our approval
plan shelves thanks to its title.  I'm now trying to get it transfered to Ames
Library.  In fact I might just even try and read it.  Surely it will be much
easier reading that ORIENTALISM AND THE POST-COLONIALPREDICAMENT.  However
I'm now in the second part which is much easier to read, in fact downright fun.
But it is always good to have a "good read" on the horizon too.
Thanks once again.
Don
