                                         Friday, January 28, 1994
I just received a fax message from Mohan Tambe (GIST Group, C-DAC, Pune)
about a pending meeting:  AKSHARA '94 the International Conference on
Applications of Information Technology in South Asian Languages, New Delhi
February 24-25.  A write-up which was to accompany the fax did not arrive.
Does anyone know where in New Delhi it will be held?

Thanks in advance,

     Jim Agenbroad ( jage at seq1.loc.gov  (that's one dot L in the middle))
