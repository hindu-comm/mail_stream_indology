The heading says it all -- I am looking for a school, or class, or
private teacher, for Hindi and/or Sanskrit anywhere in the Greater
Boston area.  Sanskrit at Harvard is not an option for me, as I find
the head of that department (who teaches many of the classes) to be
sexist, racist, boorish, anti-Indian, and disinterested in
spirituality.  (Other than that, he's a fine guy :))

Anyhow, all suggestions are welcome.  

Namaste --
