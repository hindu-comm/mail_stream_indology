        RE: HINDI AND RAJASTANI MSS ID (24 JAN 94) 

Hello, regarding the manuscripts you mention  I believe they are all quite 
obscure and a quick check indicates that none of these works or their 
authors are in the Nagari Pracarini Sabha survey of Hindi manuscripts. 

However, I have a comment regarding the work called Koka-bhusana by Josi 
Jagananatha in the second manuscript.  The Wellcome collection contains a 
copy of a medical work by an author of the same name which was copied in AD 
1747.  As the subject of Koka might also have been a topic written on by an 
author of a medical work it is possible they are by the same author.  I can 
find no references to this author anywhere apart from in our manuscript. 
>From the viewpoint of the history of Indian Koka sastra/medicine this might 
well be an interesting manuscript. 

Hope this is of some interest.

Is there a Saiva connection with any of these mss.?

          Re:  'Saiva connection of Hindi and Rajasthani mss. 

          I  just took  a quick look over the 'Sivapraka-a'sar-am-aya.na ms 
          and  saw  no references to Siva.  Could Sivaprakasa have been the 
          poet's patron?  I  see  no references to Siva  or Saivism in  the 
          other  mss  of  3  works, although  I  can't  make  much  of  the 
          Rajasthani.
