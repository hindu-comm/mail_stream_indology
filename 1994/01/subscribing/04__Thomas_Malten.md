Subject: ELEPHANT MEDICINE BOOK

          I own a  MS book on the medicine of elephants, written in 'Hindi' 
          (taking that word  in  a  wide sense), with illustrations showing 
          each illness personified as a demonic being attacking an elephant 
          in various bodily parts.  I have never seen another complete copy 
          of this but  a private collector owns a single sheet from another 
          copy. There is nothing like this in any of the published Sanskrit 
          books  on elephants and Gajayurveda I  have seen.  The individual 
          leaf may  be used in  a planned exhibit at another institution on 
          Indian medicine; so finding out  more about the  work  has become 
          more important.  Is anyone familiar with books of this type?  Are 
          there other medical books with illustrations showing the diseases 
          as demons, e.g. on human or equine medicine?  The only ones I  am 
          familiar with are some published eds. of the Kumaratantra showing 
          the diseases attacking children under 16 as demons.

Subject: BHARTRHARI CONFERENCE VOLUME

          The papers  of  the Bharthari conference do  not  appear  in  the 
          Library of Congress online catalog, including titles  in  process 
          of cataloging.  But perhaps one  of  the participants can  answer 
          best.

Subject: SNAKESKIN AND BOOKMARKS

          In several Sanskrit and Hindi Mss  that have been offered to  the 
          Library of Congress, one Ms has what appears to be fragments of a 
          snake's cast-off skin.   Is anyone aware  of religious or magical 
          uses of these in India, or  any reason why they should be kept in 
          a  book, beyond  books  being convenient for storing flat  things 
          like letters, addresses, and money?  The skin is  too delicate to 
          be useful for  a bookmark (as  I  found  when trying  to  wash  a 
          complete one  I found in  a  park  to  get  the smell off).  Does 
          anyone have any comments of things used for bookmarks or kept  in 
          books in Hindu India?  I  have found pressed flowers in  a couple 
          of mss in institutional libraries. 
          Somewhere in my notes I have a passag e copied from a Ms of rules 
          of reading and treatment of books, e.g. one  may  not  read lying 
          down, but I don't recall any ruleson inserting thing s in books.
