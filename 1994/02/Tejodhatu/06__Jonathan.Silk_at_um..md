I do not have the references before me, but in matters like this
(re: tejodhatu), La Vallee Poussin's translation of the Abhidharma-
kosa should be considered the first reference in almost all cases.
The index is good, though not complete.  There exists an English
translation of the French (Leo Pruden), but I have not checked it.
