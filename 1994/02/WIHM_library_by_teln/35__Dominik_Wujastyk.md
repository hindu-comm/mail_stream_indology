I have been able to connect with the Wellcome Institute library over
JANET, using X.25 calls, but not over the internet using telnet.
This difficulty has also been reported by several INDOLOGY readers.

I have reported the problem to the systems people here, and it is under
investigation.

Best wishes,

Dominik
