I am trying to find out where I can write to the following linguists.  The
last trace which I have on them is that they were in Karnataka, India, in 
1983.  But where are they now?

	Uliyar Padmanabha UPADHYAYA  and
	Susheela P. UPADHYAYA

I am trying to follow their publications on Dravidian language

Thank you

Subject: Indic and SEAsian fonts

In answer to inquiries by Tom Greer and others,

Ecological Linguistics has a full range of Indic and Southeast Asian Postscript
and TrueType fonts (including even several older alphabets no longer in active
use; excluding Oriya) intended primarily for Macintosh, where the keyboarding
is extremely convenient.

(These are usable also in Windows TrueType with WordPerfect 5.2 or with other
utilities which permit user remapping of the keyboard arrangement.)

Best quality for the price available.  Rated the "best foreign language laser
fonts around" for the last two years by the very active Berkeley Macintosh
Users' Group.

For a free complete catalog, please indicate the alphabets of most interest to
you and:

Please send an email message with your complete postal address (not Fax) to
(via Internet if necessary):

Or write to:
Ecological Linguistics, PO Box 15156, Washington D.C. 20003.

Or leave a message with your postal address on the answering machine at USA

Looking forward to supplying your needs.
