Prof Esther Solomon was for many years Prof. of Sanskrit at Gujarat
University, Ahmedabad.  Her best known contributions are to the early
textual history of Sankhya.  (She is one of the very few people ever to
have seen a manuscript from the Jnana Bhandar in Jaisalmere.)  I have an
idea that she is now retired, but I'm not sure.

I don't know of any one else, or anyone in Baroda.
