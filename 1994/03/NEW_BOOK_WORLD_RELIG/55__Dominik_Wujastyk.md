I'll throw the fat into the fire by suggesting that -- at least for
phenomenologist students of religion -- this would be a first reason for
disqualification if considered as a *primary* criterion for authorship of a
book of this kind.

Now if each of the authors had penned a chapter on eachother's traditions,
I might have bought it.  But then there would be forty-two chapters instead
of a mere seven; three thousand pages instead of a mere five hundred.  So
perhaps I wouldn't be able to afford it.

Just joking.  :-)
