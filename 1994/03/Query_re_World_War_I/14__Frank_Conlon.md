A query regarding discussion of World War II appeared here recently.  I 
just noticed a WWII-L in existence.  Its current list owner may be 
contacted at JEWELL at MACE.CC.PURDUE.EDU  although I gather some revision 
of arrangements may be underway.  At any rate, a posting to that address 
should get you the proper details for subscribing to the list.

Dear Mr. Conlon,
