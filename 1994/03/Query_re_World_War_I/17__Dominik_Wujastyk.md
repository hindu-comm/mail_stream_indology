The members of the INDOLOGY list -- including me -- are powerless to change
your address.  You have to do it yourself.

>From your old address (delphi), send the message "unsub indology" to the
address "listserv at liverpool.ac.uk".

>From your new address (nyu), send the message "sub indology Siddharth V..."
to the same listserv address.

If you have difficulty with the above for any reason (say if your old
account is already closed), contact Chris Wooff who administers INDOLOGY at
Liverpool <QQ43 at UK.AC.LIVERPOOL>.

Best wishes,

Dominik
