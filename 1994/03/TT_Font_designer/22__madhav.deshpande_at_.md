Subject: LIST OF ASIA NETWORKS?

          I have been asked to send an institution overseas a  list of Asia 
          related interenet networks, including East and Inner as  well  as 
          South and Southeast Asia.  Does anyone out there have or know  of 
          an already created list of this sort they could send to me? 

          Thanks,
