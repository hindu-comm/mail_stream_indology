Dear Indologists,

I am glad that I am able to communicate with this group of indologist
while staying in Paris for a few months.

1. I would be very much interested to know what sort of programmes
have been used for the computerisation of the main indological
libraries around the world.

2. I wonder whether any one of you has got experience
with the CDS/ISIS developed by UNESCO.

Any information on these two points is most welcome.

Thanking in you in advance,


With regards,

S. A. S. Sarma,
French Institute, Dept. of Indology, Pondicherry.
