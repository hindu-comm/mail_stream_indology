I have heard many different versions of this story. Answer-man Cecil
Adams dealt with this question in a recent edition of his column
"The Straight Dope". I don't have it any more, but as I recall, Adams'
research showed that there had been a proposal to translate government
documents into German. It did get voted on, but didn't pass -- and
the vote was nowhere near as close as one vote.

Subject: T.R.V. MURTI'S DEATH DATE

          Does anyone know OFFHAND the death date of  T.  R.  V. Murti, the 
          scholar of Buddhism and  Indian philosophy?  I  have referred the 
          patron who needs it  to JAOS, JAS, and Philosophy East  and  West 
          for obituaries.  I don't have the  time  to  look  in  the stacks 
          myself.  I  also suggested he  call  the Center for  the Study of 
          World Religions in Harvard.  But  it  anyone knows without having 
          to search I would appreciate knowing it. 

          Thanks
