Dear Colleagues:

This will serve as a short note to advise you that Professor Fritz 
Lehmann of the University of British Columbia, died April 26 after a 
brief illness.  A scholar who specialized on subjects of Islamic 
civilization in India, especially Bihar, he also had an interest in 
railway history.  Details regarding funeral/memorial are not yet available.
