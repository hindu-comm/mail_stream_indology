Dominik,
     Who made this announcement about making Sanskrit the language of
administration in 7 years?  Can you give more details?  I know that RSS
and BJP are capable of going in this direction, but I cannot believe
that the Narasing Rao government will do this.  There must be more to this.
                        Madhav
