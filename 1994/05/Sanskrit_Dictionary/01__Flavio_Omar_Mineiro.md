Dear Colleagues:
	I am looking for an electronic Sanskrit dictionary for running 
under DOS or Windows. 
	Exists something like this?
	 CD-ROM?

	Thank you.

  While translating an early nineteenth-century Punjabi/Braj text I 
came across the name of a king who has me completely stumped.  The 
passage goes something like this: 
       "As Raja Bipasachat witnessed the attractions of Maya so too 
do the Sikhs..."  The passage may also read this way: 

       "As the Brahman Raja Sachat [Bip is a Punjabi word for 
Brahman]..." 

  Any word on a text which deals with this elusive king will be a 
great help.

          Could  Raja Bipasachata be  (in  Sanskrit) Vipas'cit?   The  only 
          individuals I  see for this name are (St. Petersburg Lexicon) the 
          Indra under the  Manu Sva-rokis.a(Visnupurana, Markandeya Purana) 
          and a Buddha (Lalitavistara).  Vettam Mani's Puranic Encyclopedia 
          adds "husband  of Pi-vari-, the  princess  of  Vidarbha.   It  is 
          mentioned in  the Markandeya Purana, that because of  the  sinful 
          acts done by this man towards his wife he had to  go  to hell.  A 
          look at  S. Sorenson's Index to the names in  the Mahabharata and 
          other books of onomastics might turn up other characters.  Or  it 
          could be  a  name made up  for  the character in this work, "King 
          Wise."
