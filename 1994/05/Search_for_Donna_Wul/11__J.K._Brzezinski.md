Does anyone know the E-mail address of Donna Wulff, the scholar of

Thank you for your help.

Hullo!  I was wondering if any subscriber in this newsgroup knows about the histroy of evolution(?) of Konkansth Brahmins from Maharashtra? I am particularly interested in knowing why they are fair w/different coloured eyes.
