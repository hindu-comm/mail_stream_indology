Good morning!
Two questions please: Are there any devanagari and tamil fonts
on the market (for PC)? If yes, may I have addresses, phone numbers,
faxes, e-mails and prices?
And old sanskrit texts? Do already exist e.g. mahabharatam, ramayanam,
vedas, upanishads, kathasaritsagaram etc. etc. on diskettes or CD's?
Thank you very much for your kind help, I really appreciate it very
much.
Very faithfully,





						Petr Holman

P.S. And sanskrit grammar?
