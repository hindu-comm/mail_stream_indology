Due to the politically sensitive issue of Khalistan movement, khalsanet 
is not open to the public.  Apparently one needs to be introduced by a 
current subscriber to the Khalsanet.  This is what I gathered from the 
posting of an individual in the usenet newsgroup soc.culture.indian.  
If you have access to the usenet, you could try to posting this 
request to soc.culture.indian and perhaps someone will help you out.
