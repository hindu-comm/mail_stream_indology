> 	A useful source of information on eduacational materials in print for

> of useful info for South Asianists, including a directory of scholars of 
> South Asia which includes searchable "keyword" interests.  There are also 
> catalogues of resources available online and lots of other goodies.  
> Those interested may access this info using "gopher" software or by 
> direct telnet connection to the host at Columbia 
> (columbianet.columbia.edu--it is found under "CLIO Plus" heading).

Hello,
	Is there any ftp site for the above. (Alternative to gopher).
Thanks,
Vineet.
