I should greatly appreciate it if someone could give
me the email address and mailing address of Mr R C Jamieson,
who, at last report, was connected with Cambridge University
Library. 
Thanks,
Ken

Rosane,
The 1911 edition as well as the 1961 reprint were both done by The Law
Printing House in Madras, at least according to our cataloging records.
Alas, Ames does not have a copy of the Hortus Indicus Malabaricus.
