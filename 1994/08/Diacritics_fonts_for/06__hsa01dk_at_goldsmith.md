Dear Alec,

I am interested in your fonts. Would they work with any Windows? I realise
the macros won't be the same, but I would like to use them with AmiPro if
possible.

>(Indiana) and SRC (London) archives in the next few hours, but I've

Can you give me the SRC site address, please?

Many thanks,
Damien
