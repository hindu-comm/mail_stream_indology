Samgita has been defined in Samgitaratnakara by Sarngadeva(13c) as "gitam 
vadyam tatha nrttam trayam samgitamucyate"SR.1.21., that is, songs, 
instrumental music and dance-these three taken together constitute 
samgita. Etymologically, the word means the union of tauryatrika (three 
performing arts).  Mandakranta Bose
