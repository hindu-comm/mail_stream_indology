Following up on Madhav's inquiry:

SuS'aa 3.5 has the following:

tatra s'ukrabaahulyaat pumaan, aartavabaahulyaat strii, saamyaadubhayor 
napumsakam

This may be a medical explanation of the grammatical definition; or
perhaps the grammatical explanation is another way of stating the
medical definition.

An interesting topic anyway one looks at it. Ken Zysk
