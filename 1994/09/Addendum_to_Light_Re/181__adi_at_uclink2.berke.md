>  Why God Never Received Tenure at a University:
>  ------------------------------------------------
>     1.  Because He had only one major publication.
>     2.  And it was in Hebrew.
>     3.  And it had no references.
>     4.  And it wasn't published in a refereed journal.
>     5.  And some even doubt that He wrote it Himself.
>     6.  It may be true that He created the world,
>         but what has He published/done since?
>     7.  His cooperative efforts have been quite limited.
>     8.  The scientific community has had a very rough time
>          trying to replicate His results.

Eight more reasons why God never received tenure at any university:

9.  He never applied to the Ethics Board for permission to use human subjects. 
10. When one experiment went awry he tried to cover it up by drowning the
subjects. 
11. When subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them from the sample. 
12. He rarely came to class, just told students to read the Book. 
13. Some say he had his son teach the class. 
14. He expelled his first two students for learning. 
15. Although there were only ten requirements, most students failed his tests. 
16. His office hours were infrequent and usually held on a mountaintop.
