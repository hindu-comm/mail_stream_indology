Standard works on Folk Hinduism explode the idea
of meaningful Aryan/non-Aryan distinctions; for example,
Blackburn's paper in History of Religions some years ago,
or Biardeau's Histoire du Poteau. All of which supports exactly
what Stephen Phillips says.
Why does this outlook not get through the barrier between
Hindu studies and Buddhist studies?
