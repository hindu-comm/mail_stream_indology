satisfactory.

 I think that Satyanad's point serves to focus the discussion. No 
history of India can be complete without a clear understanding of the 
early Aryan-Dravidian interaction. As Colin Renfrew's work suggests, 
the Indo-Europeans were cultivators of land and that their expansion
was "kinder and gentler" (as coined by someone in an earlier post)
than hitherto envisaged. Therefore the early interaction is not 
necessarily antagonistic. What are the scholarly opinions in this 
area ? 

 In this time in history of man, this forum should be the best place 
in the world to come ask questions on Indian history. Bear in mind, 
that the forum itself constitutes historical record. I hope that it 
shall never be said that questions went abegging...

All the best, 
J.B. Sharma
