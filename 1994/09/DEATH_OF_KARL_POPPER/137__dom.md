> The philosopher Sir Karl Popper has died, aged 92, in a Surrey hospital. 
> He died in the Mayday Hospital in Croydon after a long illness. He 
> became world famous through publication of works such as "The Open 
> Society and Its Enemies", in which he sought to rebut Marxism, Fascism
> and other authoritarian ideologies.
