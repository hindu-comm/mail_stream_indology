Re: Indus Valley Script request made by Jim Hatzell.  The late Walter Fairservis
came out with a new book about a year and a half ago about this very topic.  I do not know the title of the book offhand and have not read it, but Walter told
me that it advanced a new theory that broke the coding of the script.  If someone else on the network does not mention this book, you might try BIP under authors.  Mary McGee
