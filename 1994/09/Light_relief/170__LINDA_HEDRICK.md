Thank you, Julia!

WA hotel I was staying in at in Madras had huges sige signs hanging both inside and 
outside the front door.  The outside sign read "Entrance In", and the
outside signsinside sign read "Entrance Out".

A few weeks later I passed a laundry in Bombay with a sign that said:
"Ladies, leave your clothes with us and enjoy your day."

My boyfriendA little closer to home...my boyfriend's favorite Chinese restaurant in
Washington sta

te has a sign in the parking lot that warns, "Parkers will
be violated."
