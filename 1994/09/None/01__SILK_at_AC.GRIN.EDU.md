In the bibliography to "The Sound of Religion", Numen 33/2 (1986), Staal
refers to a volume edited by Michel Strickmann called _Classical Asian
Rituals and the Theory of Ritual_, Berlin, 1986.  I have been unable to
trace any such volume.  Does anyone have any bibliographic details?  Was it
published in some Academy's Abhandlung or some such thing?  Does it
actually exist at all?

Thanks for the help.
