I am looking for the telephone number (and if it exists email address) of
ULRICH PAGEL, who is now curator of the Tibetan collections in the British
Library.  Or perhaps someone in London can just tell me the general phone
number for the British Library, if Pagel's number remains a mystery?
        With many thanks, in advance,
