With regard to No.2, I sent this address directly to Professor ZYSK.
But I will send it again to the Indology network,
as it seems that other people need it.

Oriental Institute has recently changed their address.

The new address is

Oriental Institute (M.S.University of Baroda)
Opp. Palace Gate, Palace Road, Vadodara 390 001
(Gujarat) India

Regarding the the purchase of books,

The University Publications Sales Unit
General Education Centre,
Pratapgunj, Baroda 390 002
