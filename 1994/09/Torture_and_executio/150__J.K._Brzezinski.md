Subject: Torture and execution


	I was wondering whether anyone knows if the dynasties of northern
India from the time of Mahmud of Ghazni to the coming of the British made
use of torture and public execution.  If so (and I have good reason to
believe they did) for what reasons were these utilised.  Were fellow
Muslims also tortured (Sarmad the Jewish convert to Islam (acc.  to
tradition).  Why?  Were many non-Muslims really presented with the option
of conversion to Islam or death?  Was the Jizya tax as discriminatory as 
traditional accounts portray?  I am particularly interested in legal 
literature in regard to torture and public execution (if such exists).  
As these dynasties were identified as Muslim there seems no doubt that my 
search will eventually take me to the Shariat.  What does Muslim Law 
prescribe in this case is something I will look into.  Again any help you 
can offer will be greatly appreciated.
