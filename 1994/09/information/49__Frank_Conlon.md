With respect to #1, the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and 
Ireland, Bombay Branch is now the Asiatic Society of Bombay.  The address 
remains Town Hall, Horniman Circle, Bombay 400001.  (the PIN code may be 
changed).  I am not sure whether you are seeking copies of their 
publications or other sorts of materials, but my 1993-94 Annual Report 
lists Mrs. Vimal Shah as Honorary Secretary, or, perhaps address a query 
to The Librarian.
