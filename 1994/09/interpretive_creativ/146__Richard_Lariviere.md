I stand flumoxed and corrected!  But mostly flumoxed.

ps -- Jonathan thanks very much for sending the copy of the article on 
Brahmin Judges in Traditional Hindu Society.  It is really useful.  Are

The 1987 and 1988 editions of the BAS have been published. I have received 
copies.  Presumably they will be making their way to your libraries shortly 
if they haven't already.

                                           Library  of  Congress  seems  to 
                                           have received only v. 1 so far.  
                                           This  seems  to   be   the  same 
                                           version as the Canadian

          The following is presumably that:

Subject: FAIRSERVIS ON INDUS SCRIPT

          Pardon me  if this was already answered by someone else, but  the 
          recent work  by  the later Walter Fairservis on  the Indus script 
          Mary McGee mentioned must be this: 

          91-31028 
          Fairservis, Walter Ashlin, 1921-   
          The Harappan civilization and  its writing  ;  a  model  for  the 
          decipherment of the Indus script
