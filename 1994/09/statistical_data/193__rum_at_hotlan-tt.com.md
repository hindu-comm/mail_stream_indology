Does anyone know where I can find the following information:

1. Names of towns and cities in India with their longitudes and
   latitudes.

2. Demographic data, by state, on:

   tribes, their names, and number of people in each,
   castes (subcastes), their names, and number of people in each,
   languages, their names, and number of people in each.
   dialects of each language, their names, and number of people in each.

   other social and cultural characteristics such as:
   number of different dress styles, cuisines, etc.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: SRI CAKRA PAMPHLET READY

          Re:  Pamphlet on Sri Cakra-Sri Vidya 

          I'm sorry but  the names and addresses of  the  3  people besides 
          Doug Brooks who took up my offer of copies of the pamphlet on the 
          proper way of constructing the Sri Cakra: 

          Caturvedi, Candrasekhara 
          Tantrik varg  se nirnay ki  mang  :  Sri Vidya mantra ka visuddha 
          svarup? 
          Mathura : Rajesvari Press, n.d. 

          have  dropped  off  my  computer files.   (I  have  extended  the 
          retention period of all of them) 

          The photocopies are  ready.  Could anyone wanting a  copy  please 
          contact  me  directly  (not  through INDOLOGY) with  their  snail 
          addresses?   I do have Doug's address.
