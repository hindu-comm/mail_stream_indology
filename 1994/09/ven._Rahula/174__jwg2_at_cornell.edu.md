The Venerable Walpola Rahula is currently Chancellor of The University of
Kelaniya, Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. Correspondence so directed should reach him
there. He also has a residence at Jayawardanapura (Nugegoda) Sri Lanka. I
do not have the exact address with me, but he is sufficiently well known
there that correspondence should find him there as well. I hope that this
will do.
