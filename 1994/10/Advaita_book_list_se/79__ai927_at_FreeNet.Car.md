Subject: DUTT'S MBH.: UNUSUAL FORMAT

          Any library with more money to spare than LOC  may  be interested 
          in acquiring this title from Grant and Shaw, Edinburgh:

          Ramayana.  Translated  into  English  prose  from   the  original 
          Sanskrit....

          Calcutta, 1889-94 
          BOUND FROM THE ORIGINAL MONTHLY PARTS, 7 VOLS. IN 4, 8vo. 

          This is item no. 141 in catalogue 23.  The address is:

          The preservation of  the original publishing history might be  of 
          interest, though there may well be several copies bound the  same 
          way in various libraries.
