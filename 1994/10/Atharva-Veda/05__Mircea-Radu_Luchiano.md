Hello,
 I am a student at the American University in Bulgaria, researching 
for a project in comparative mythologies. Does anyone know how I can 
find a translation (English or French) of Atharva-Veda (or parts of 
it)? We have access to Internet sources, but I doubt it's on-line. 
All suggestions welcome. Please reply to my address and not on the 
list, since I am not subscribed.

Thanks in advance and afterwards,
Radu Luchianov <s0192556 at cos.aubg.bg>
