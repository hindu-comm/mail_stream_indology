          Vadivelu, A., Ruling chiefs, nobles, and zamindars of India. 

          A search on RLIN shows that New York University has  a copy (RLIN 
          no. lsp94-278) 

          The same author has the two vol. work The aristocracy of southern 
          India,  Madras,  s.n.,  1903-  and  reprinted  Delhi   :   Mittal 
          Publications, 1984 (LCCN 84-900896).
