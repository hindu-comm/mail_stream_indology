That goes to prove another of my point that language is more a politics 
than usage. I was raised in culture which worships Sanskrit but does not 
speak it. The same was true for Hindi in Panjab where many people who 
spoke Panjabi claimed Hindi as their mother tongue causing friction in 
Panjab so that Panjabi has become equated with only a particular 
religion. As David pointed out a few people claimed Sanskrit as their 
mother tongue in census questions. It is in the same spirit that Hebrew 
was revived as national language of Israel. 
In retrospection and as political prudence it would have been better if 
India had revived Sanskrit as national language in stead of Hindi. 
Sanskrit would have been equally hard for north and south Indian and 
their would have been no complaint in 1947.

Moreover, Sanskrit means Cultured or cultivated language which proves 
that there must be  a language of the masses whether it was Pali or Prakrit.

There are people who will claim Esperanto or Cobol as their mother tongues.
