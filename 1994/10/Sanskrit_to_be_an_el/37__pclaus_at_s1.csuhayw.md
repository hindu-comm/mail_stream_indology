There is a village in the Malnad region of Karnataka (Shimoga Dist.
I think) where I am told the language is Sanskrit.  The name of the
village slips my mind at the moment, but I could find it out for you
if you need it.  It is a relatively recent village decree, and the
village is largely (entirely?) made up of members of the Brahmin
community. How strictly it is enforced I don't know.

Subject: SANSKRIT SPEAKING VILLAGE

          I think the Sanskritophone village was the subject of  an article 
          in  the  last  year  or  two  in either of  the  two newsweeklies 
          Frontline or  India  Today,  both  of  which  I  get  for current 
          reference but which I don't have time to search now.
