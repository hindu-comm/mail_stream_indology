What a lot of interest in a Sanskrit-speaking village! 
I will gather all of your questions and send them off to some friends
who live in nearby villages, with whom I correspond regularly. So
ask away and I should have answers in a month and a half or so. Perhaps
best to send mail to me at pclaus at csuhayward.edu
I pass the village often -- and will do so in December. This time I'll
stop and check it out: I wonder if they speak Kannada.
