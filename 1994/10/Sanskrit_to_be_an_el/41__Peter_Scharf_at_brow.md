Dear Dominik,
        I'm not sure I understand your reference introducing the news that
Sanskrit will be an elective subject in High Schools:

        Do you find anything objectionable to Sanskrit being made an
elective subject?  Is there anything objectionable to Latin being
reinstated as an elective subject in many American schools recently after a
period of its absence?  Because Latin has been introduced does that imply
any prejudice against Greek?  Or is a matter of degree immediately
prejudice?
