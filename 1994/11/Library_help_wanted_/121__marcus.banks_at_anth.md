I'm posting on behalf of a non-computerate Indologist in the US who is
trying to find the following publication in any *US* library:

_Profiles of districts_ Bombay, Centre for Monitering Indian Economy

>From what I can tell from my source it is an annual publication in book
form; I have no ISBN number and am not sure how long it has been going. The
entries for each district appear to cover geography, natural resources and
'39 key economic and social indicators'.

Many thanks in advance and please post directly to me to save bandwidth.
