Prof. Tokunaga's digitalized versions of the Ramayana & Mahabharata
texts are now conveniently linked for direct access through The South
Asia Gopher, in the ELECTRONIC TEXTS/Archives submenu. Since Tom
Ridgeway has announced that his Indic ftp archive at University of
Washington may not be around much longer, I will explore the
possibility of mirroring all those files here from the Columbia ftp
file server (with links, again, through the SAG). Suggestions and
comments welcome.  Thanks.  David Magier   magier at columbia.edu
