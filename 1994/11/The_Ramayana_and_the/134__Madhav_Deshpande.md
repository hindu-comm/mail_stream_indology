	Finally I successfully downloaded the Ramayana and Mahabharata 
files in their CSX (zip) format and was able to read them on my Mac with 
diacritics using my Manjushree-CSX font.  I congratulate and thank 
Professor Tokunaga for his enormous contribution to Indology.  I would 
also like to thank Tom Ridgeway for converting the original files to the 
CSX format.  His work has made these files immediately accessible to 
those of us who use CSX compatible fonts.  Converting files from one 
format to another is a major task.  With Tom presumably leaving Seattle, 
I hope someone else will continue to offer this assistance, perhaps we 
can volunteer David Magier.
