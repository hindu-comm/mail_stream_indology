Among the numerous weapons found in classical sanskrit literature, I am trying to focus my attention on the bhuSuNDi or bhuSaNDi - other alternate spellings occur. It is found many times in the Mahabharata (a complete list is now very easy to obtain thanks to prof. Tokunaga's e-text), and - strangely enough - not once in the Ramayana. Van Buitenen translates the term as "flame thrower", though not consistently so. 
Indeed, the BhuSuNDi - as described for instance by the poetess Gauri in two stanzas of subhaaSita - does seem like a rather peculiar implement of destruction:mention is made of its fiery balls and venomous mouth. Gauri is probably a fairly late poetess, and I am wondering whether she is describing some kind of hand-held firearm, or a more traditional means of offence, like the "hundred-slayer", zataghnii, with which it sometimes appears in weapons lists.
Does anyone have any suggestions?

Season's greetings and goodwill to all,
despite the belligerent object of my query!
