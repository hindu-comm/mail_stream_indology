Dear Frances,
thank you for your reminder about the Summer SANSKRIT some weeks ago. I 
have now decided to teach it myself, again, as in the past few years.
The details will follow. Typically they include something like the 
following:

: Session c. June 26-Aug. 18;
Meets Monday- Thursday each afternoon 3.30-6 p.m.
8 unit course, tuition (last year) $ 2500 (some assistance available for 
High School students only).
If desired, on Campus housing (last summer) $ 2080.
>From last year's Catalogue: ELEMENTARY SANSKRIT:
stresses learning the Devanagari script, basic grammar, and essential 
vocabulary. Emphasis is given to correct translation of passages from 
simple narrative literature and the epics...

I will send the details for the Columbia gopher as soon as they are ready 
here.

Best wishes for 1995!
Yours Michael
