A colleague of mine who has no access to the Internet has asked me
to inquire whether anyone on BUDDHA-L or INDOLOGY is currently
doing research on Buddhism in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,
especially during the 6th to 10th centuries. She is well aware of
the scholarly literature in this field and simply wishes to be sure
she has not overlooked work that has come out during the past couple
of years. Please reply directly to me if you have any references I
might pass on to her.
