What an unusual (for me) and interesting topic.  My best guess is that
the real information about accounting methods in pre-modern India (i.e.,
before adoption of British methods) is buried in documents in private and
state-level libraries, in local languages and in some cases special
scripts like Modi.

I remember some years ago seeing vast piles of accounts documents from
the Maharaja's family, in Jodhpur.  I thought at the time that a wealth
of personal detail about past social life must be locked up in this
material, but it would be a tough project to get at it.  Similar heaps
of stuff will surely be mouldering away in Chettinad, Marwar, etc.
The usual scenario for manuscript material.
