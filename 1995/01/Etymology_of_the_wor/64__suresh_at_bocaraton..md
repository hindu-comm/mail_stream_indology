I am interested to know the etymology of the word kundan(am).
In telugu, it is used in the meaning of gold.  I am not very 
sure  whether it is a Sanskrit word or not, though I have 
North Indian friends, named as kundan. Thus, I believe 
that it is a Sanskrit word.

Any information about this word is appreciated. 

Regards,
Suresh.
