Dear colleagues,

I just downloaded Prof. Yano's program from the Kyoto site. However, it
seems that I need a program called uudecode for the PC to decode the binary
file. Being a Mac user, I have access to uudecode for the Mac, which
apparently will not do the trick. Would anybody know of a ftp-site where
uudecode for the PC is available? (I tried Kyoto, without luck)

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
