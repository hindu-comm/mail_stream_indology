Hi Rolf,
thank you so much for your answer to my query. What a coincidence: 
you are on your way to the South Pole; I am a Southern (by spirit) 
Pole and one of Shiva's forms is a pole (or lin-ga). The texts I got 
from you inspired me to think about the nature of Shiva in a new way. 
Many scholars put a stress on Shiva's ambiguity. He rules both 
fertily and destruction. Also, in the exchange of letters I got I can 
trace some signs of this duality but they are very subtle and this 
subtility led me to the thought of the fundamental impossibility of 
distinguishing between creation and destruction (especially in the 
shaivaite context). When you create anything something (eg some 
material) vanishes; when something vanishes new things (eg broken 
pieces) show up. This is only the limited perspective of a person (or 
a "mask"; I would not like to say "individual" as for me the very 
"individual" would be Shiva himself) that makes this asessment 
possible. All things are proper parts of a good play. Pralaya too is 
such a part. 
            Hoping for more to rise and fall
                                    Lesl~aw Borowski

Shalin,

I was intrigued by your topic and have a few suggestions. 

1. You might wish to look at Timberg's book  on Marwaris. 
Here is the reference:
AUTHOR: Timberg, Thomas A., 1942-
TITLE: The Marwaris, from traders to industrialists / Thomas A.
Timberg.
PUB. INFO: New Delhi : Vikas, c1978.
DESCRIPTION: vi, 268 p. : ill. ; 23 cm.
SUBJECTS: *S1 Marwaris.


2. If you can get hold of Devara's paper "From Mutsaddis to Marwaris" 
that would also be helpful. The reference follows:
AUTHOR: Devara, Ji. Esa. Ela., 1944-
TITLE: A rethinking on the politics of commercial society in pre
-colonial India [microform] : transition from Mut Saddi to
Marwari / by G.S.L. Devra.
PUB. INFO: New Delhi : Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, 1987.
DESCRIPTION: 87 p. ; 28 cm.
SERIES: Occasional papers on history and society ; no. 38

3. IIM Ahmedabad has a case of the Parta system used by Marwari 
businessmen even today. You can possibly write for it or send 
e-mail to some there.

4. Prakrit Bharati in Jaipur is putting together a compendium 
of quotations from the classical texts pertaining to business 
and commerce. It should be ready soon. Someone has the proofs, 
I am sure.

By the way, what sort of evidence do we have for your ovbservation 
that Indians are high on the Power distance and Masculinity scale ? 
I had seen some work on Indian children which pointed to a very high
 power orientation. But this seems to be different.
