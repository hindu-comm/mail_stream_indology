Dr. Wujastyk and other subscribers,

I would like to point out the fact that I just sent the article to 
INDOLOGY as I thought it would be of some interest to the subscribers.

I would like to emphasize that the article was not drawn up by myself, 
and thus do not wish to be implicated with it.

For those interested and those concerned, the individual who wrote the 
article is Dinesh Agarwal who may be contacted at <DXA4 at PSUVM.PSU.EDU>.

Thank you.
