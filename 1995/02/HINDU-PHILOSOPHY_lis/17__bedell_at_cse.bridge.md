Does anyone know the address for the HINDU-PHILOSOPHY list?  It used to be
available through <majordomo at world.std.com>, but now it has apparently
been shut down or moved to another site.  There were also lists for
BUDDHIST-PHILOSOPHY, ISLAMIC-PHILOSOPHY, and CHINESE-PHILOSOPHY, but now
they are gone.  Can anyone tell me their fate?
