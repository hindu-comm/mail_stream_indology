Dear Jeson, 

Thanks for your message.  I hope that your shared information on how 
to subscribe to Indology with Michael Rosse.  It will be fun to talk 
with one another, along with a lot of other scholars, about Indology 
matters via Liverpool, England. 

My husband joins me in sending warm regards.

Affectionately,

--
