Question is whether this was an adaptation from the English (or other
European) occupation or it predated the occupation. There are many words in 
all the Indian languages that have been adapted from European
sources.

On the other hand, some scholars seem to feel that Tamil split off
from the original Indo-European root stock at a pre-Sanskritic stage,
and thus exhibits affiliations with certain European words, where
Sanskrit appears to have no relation.
