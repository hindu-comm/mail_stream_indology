Thanks for the very helpful info on Tamil transliteration.

The convention in Sanskrit transliteration is that the unmarked "e" and
"o" are always long, and if you want to talk about short versions, they
are marked with a breve.  So you never need the macron.  Is it different
in Tamil?  In Kannada there are three versions of "e" and "o", so I can
imagine one would indeed need at least two marked vowel signs.
