I'm afraid grammarians talk about this letter, mainly in order to deny
its existence.

Yes.

The tilde indicates a nasalized l; the underdotted one is vocalic l.
Yes, we need an accented version of vocalic l put into CSX.

There is no special letter for the "dark" l of Vedic and Marathi, and
perhaps this needs to be remedied.

E and o with macrons. Or have I missed something in your question?

Thank you very much for your observations.  Perhaps at the next Sanskrit
meeting a few of us could get round a table and discuss revisions to
CSX.
