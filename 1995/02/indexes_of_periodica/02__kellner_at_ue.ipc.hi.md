I could regularly post indexes of Japanese journals (such as
JIBS/IBK), if that is of interest, although I have yet to
find the way through the Japanese publication jungle myself.
As far as my experience goes, Japanese articles can indeedbe
useful even for non-Japanese speakers (neat paryuda at sa, isn't it?),
as they usually give a lot of references to other material.
