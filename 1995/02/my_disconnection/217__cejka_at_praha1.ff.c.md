In my reply to APABHRAMSA I wrote that our central computer is to be
disconnected from internet on Tuesday (28 Feb) morning, and I DID NOT mean
it is for ever. Only on Tue, temporarily.

To the management of the list:
please inform me - will this cause that indology postings posted to me on
that day will be lost for me? (if this could be avoided do it please)
Thanks for patience to those, who are not concerned with this.
