I hope the moderators continue to use a relatively light
hand.  The variety of voices and subjects is valuable--
from etymology to certain political issues.  It is
interesting to see new members join as old ones leave,
or get burned out.  Then again, I don't have to pay by
the message.  BTW, doesn't Paul Tillich's "ground of
being" sound vaguely Buddhist?
