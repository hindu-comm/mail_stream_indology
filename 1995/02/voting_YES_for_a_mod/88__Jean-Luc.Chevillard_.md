I know that no vote has been started
and I know that the founder of INDOLOGY (Dominik)
has not volunteered to moderate it
(he seemed to think it would be time-consuming),
but since the idea appears to be on the air,
I feel like giving my opinion.
So many reasons have been mentionned that I do not believe
any good one can be added.

So, YES, I would like this list to be moderated.
