Namaste:

I realize this anecdotal message is not going to contribute to a scholarly
discussion on the subject, so feel free to stop here ...

I was at the Calabasis Balaji Temple for Mahasivaratri Monday night
(that is near Malibu, Calif.)  Near me a little girl was being hoisted
on her father's shoulder to watch gallon after gallon after gallon of
milk cascading over the Shiva Lingam.  She said, "Daddy, why are they
pouring milk on the Lord?"  He said, "Because Lord likes it."

aum

Subject: PICTURE OF SAVITRI

          A  library patron  has requested help  in  finding some  work  of 
          Indian fine  art illustrating the  story  of Savitri and Satyavan 
          for use in publishing a translation or version of it.   Is anyone 
          aware of one of the top of their head? 

          Thanks,
