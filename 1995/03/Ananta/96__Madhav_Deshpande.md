Thanks for the reference to Yoga-suutra II 47 which refers to Ananta.  
Though it is doubtful that the word refers to the snake divinity in the 
original suutra, one can see how a later commentator could take it as a 
proper name referring to the snake divinity.  However, it is not clear 
how even this reference could have led to the identification of Patanjali 
as an incarnation of Shesha.
