If it is any help, the Banyan produces a (fig-like) fruit.
It is usually not eaten by humans, but parrots and other birds eat it.
There are several edible figs in India today. The wild fig (atti in Te;
arti in Ka) does NOT have roots on the branches.  Cultivated figs have
aerial roots growing off of the lower trunk.  However there may be other
cultivated figs I have not seen.
