The best way to keep lists clear of undesired stuff is to ignore it.
If you don't want it, don't respond, or respond to the poster, but
posting to the list will only start further unwanted threads...
and calling for the godlike moderator seems a bit far out, given
that we are all independent, self-responsible academics...:)
