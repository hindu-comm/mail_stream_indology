One department with Gk, Latin and Skt is the Department of Classics at
the University of Newcastle, New South Wales (Australia). Sanskrit there
was introduced by the recently-retired professor of classics, Godfrey
Tanner, who still teaches it on a part-time basis. I am not sure what
the prospect for jobs in future are; probably not all that large, since
student demand is small, but it might be worth dropping Prof Tanner a
line if you're interested in that part of the world. The address is Dept
of Classics, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.
