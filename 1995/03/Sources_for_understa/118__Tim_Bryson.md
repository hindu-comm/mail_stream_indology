A college-going daughter of a friend of mine was told by her professor
that the authoritative presentation of the concept of Maya was given in
an Oxford Sanskrit Dictionary.  I'm dubious.  Would people have some
recommendations that might be helpful to an interested undergrad and
authoritative enough to satisfy a prof?  Thanks, Tim Bryson (bryson at harvarda.
