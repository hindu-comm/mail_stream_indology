           Tirun~anacampantar's Polemics
           -----------------------------

Tirun~aanacampantar is a seventh century Tamil saint, poet
who sang Tevaram, and leader of Bhakti revival.

I found the citation of a recent article:
A. Veluppillai, The Hindu confrontation with Jainism and Buddhism -
Saint Tirun~anacampantar's polemical writings,
p. 335-364, 1993, Tore Ahlback (ed.) The Problem of Ritual. 
The Donner Institute for Research in Religious and Cultural History.
Sweden.

Does any US library have Tore Ahlback's volume?
What is the OCLC or ISBN number? Thanks.

Yours,
