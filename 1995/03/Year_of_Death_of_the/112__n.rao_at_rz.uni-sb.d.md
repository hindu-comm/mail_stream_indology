Dr. Hiralal Haldhar lived in the beginning of this century and was a 
Professor of Philosophy with a neo-Hegelian pursuasion.  Is anyone in this 
list familar with his work and personality? Is there anyone remotely 
connected with him through family ties?  I urgently require the year of his 
death. This infomration is required for a German Encylopaedia on Philosophy 
and Theory of Science, which has a policy of giving the year of birth and 
death of the philosophers mentioned. 

Prof. Hiralal Haldhar taught in Calcutta University in 1930s and he must 
have died sometime in 40s or 50s. I tried many avenues to get inforamtion 
regarding the year of his death, but to no avail. Publishing  reader's 
letters and advertisements in Indian news papers have not yielded any 
results. Can anyone in this group furnish me this information or suggest 
ways of getting it? 

You can send the message to my private email address:

          RE: Adbhutasagara (contd.) 

          I forgot to mention that I am pretty sure a few years ago I saw a 
          photographic reprint of  an early ed.  of  the Adbhutasagara, but 
          the  LOC cooperative acquisitions program doesn't  seem  to  have 
          picked it  up.   You  could write Motilal Banarsidass to  see  if 
          there is such a reprint; the address is: 

          Motilal Banarsidass 
          Bungalow Road 
          Jawahar Nagar 
          Delhi 110 007
