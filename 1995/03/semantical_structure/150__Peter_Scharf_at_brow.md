It is possible that specialized meaning of these formats developed and I
offer no evidence for or against this possibility

>1)  yat (yat)..........tat (tat)..............
>2) yat.....................tat sarvam................

However, from the grammatical point of view Paa.nini's suutras regarding
doubling 8.1.1 sarvasya dve, etc. would indicate their equivalence.
