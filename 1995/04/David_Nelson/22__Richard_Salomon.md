Does anyone have the current e-mail address of David Nelson, librarian at 
Texas 
A&M (and Indologist)?  I just tried to sent him a message at an old 
address which seems no longer to be in operation.

Richard Salomon
University of Washington

You didn't mention the incorrect address, so I don't know if the following
will be helpful to you:
DNN4745 at TAMU.EDU
