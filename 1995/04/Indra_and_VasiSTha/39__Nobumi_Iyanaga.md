Dear Mr. Paolo Magnone
Dear Mr. Jim Hartzell
Thank you very much for your quick and helpful responses.
One can find in the Chinese Buddhist Canon many elements of, or 
allusions to Hindu mythology, and they often seem to be somewhat 
aberrant.  Being neither a sanskritist nor a specialist of the Hindu 
mythology, I have often difficulties to find references related to 
these stories (I'll post another question of this kind today...).  
Your kind assistance helps me greatly.  Thank you again !
