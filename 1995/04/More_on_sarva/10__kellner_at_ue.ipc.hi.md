What you call "rhetorical force" is precisely what I meant with
"content-specific" reasons for the _sarva_ not being redundant here.
To insert a bit of the context of this sentence in the translation,
you could rephrase it as "whatsoever (form of) negation there is
(in proof formulations), this is in its entirety (based on
the logical reason of) non-cognition". In the following
passages Dharmaki at rti enumerates various types of logical
applications which involve negation, and reduces all these
to the basic overall-structure of _anupalabdhi_. Given this
context, the _sarva_ is indeed not redundant - exactly
because of the "rhetorical force" etc. Of course,
from a purely propositional point of view, a lot of
Sanskrit words could be done without in all possible
kinds of texts...
