It looks to me that this subject belongs to alt.hinduism more than this list.

As regrads the subject matter, it a matter of personal belief and practice.
There is nothing to prevent anyone from worshiping any idol. 
Mythologically speaking, I have seen pictures of Hanuman carrying Sita on 
his shoulders, therefore there is no taboo against touch by women. If 
Hanuman can touch Sita innocently, other women should be allowed to touch 
him without any danger to his Brahmcharya.

BTW: How do you decide who is an _EXPERT_ astrologer since all the astrology 
is bogus and has no validity anyway?
