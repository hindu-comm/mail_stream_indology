There is a freeware TrueType font for Tamil. It is called Palladam 
and is available from CICA and mirror-sites, as well as other 
archives. To find the nearest one to you, do an Archie search using 
"palla" as the search-word.

There used to be a very nice Devanagari font on the WWW Nepali 
homepage, but I pointed out that it was copyright (which the keeper 
of the page did not know) and he promptly and correctly withdrew it.

He is making efforts to provide a replacement, so it is worth 
checking that page from time to time.

My Hindu and Bengali colleagues keep harrassing me to produce 
shareware Devanagari fonts, but I can't persuade my boss to let me 
schedule the time. Can anyone lend me a gun?  :-)

Alec.
