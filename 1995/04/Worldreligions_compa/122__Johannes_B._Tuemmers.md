Some time ago, I saw this excerpt from some magazine as a copy on a pinwall,
please enjoy (absolutely NO intend to flame anybody, anything or whatever..):

WORLDRELIGIONS COMPARED

Taoism: Shit happens

Hare Krishna: Shit happens Rama Rama ding ding.

Hinduism: This shit happened before.

Islam: If shit happens, take a hostage.

Zen: What is the sound of shit happening?

Buddhism: When shit happens, is it really shit?

Confucianism: Confucius says: "Shit".

Protestantism: Shit won't happen, if I work harder.

Catholicism: If shit happens, I deserve it.

Judaism: Why does this shit always happen to me?

Rastafarianism: Let's smoke this shit.


Thank you,

Yours, Johannes
