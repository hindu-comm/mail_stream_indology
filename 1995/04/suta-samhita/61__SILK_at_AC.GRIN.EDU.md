The AnandASrama Sanskrit Series is listed as being available in the
INDOLOGICAL SERIES AVAILABLE IN MICROFILM (produced by James Nye,
University of Chicago)
.  The message states:  for queries about this list, please contact
jnye at midway.uchicago.edu.

The list is posted on the South Asia Gopher

Microfilm is not so handy, but at least it does not (usually!!) fall apart
as you read it ;-)
