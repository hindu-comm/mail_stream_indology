Regarding E. Beach's query on suitable material for his course,
it may be useful to contact the Ramakrishna Mission, which publishes
a variety of books, some of them for youngsters, with abundant
quotations from classical texts. They have a bookstore near the
University of Chicago, and one in New York. I am sure other people
on the list will be able to give the exact address. The work of the
Ramakrishna Math, both in India and outside India needs of course no
introduction.
