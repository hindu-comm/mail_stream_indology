On 27.4.95 Darshan Shankar (Director FRLHT) wrote that
Vaidya Ram Manohar (Senior Res. Fellow, FRLHT) is proposing to
come to the IASTAM conference, London, 16-17.11.95.


Does anybody have more information on the above mentioned 
IASTAM conference (e.g. participants, venue, address of the
organizing committee)?
What does FRLHT stand for?

Thank you,
