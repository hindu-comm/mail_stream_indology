My example doesn't come from a Buddhist tradition, and it may not be 
true, but I've been told in Rajgir that the magnficent stucco sculptures 
that adorned the Maniyar Math disappeared not when the were excavated and 
exposed to weather but when they were eaten pinch at a time by devotees 
who sought the power that ingesting them would bring.  Gary, did you see 
fingers heading toward the mouth?  Rick Asher
