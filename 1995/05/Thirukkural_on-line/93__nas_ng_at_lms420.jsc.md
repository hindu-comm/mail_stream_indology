The Thirukkural is available in American English
and Tamil from World Wide Web.

For Tamil original, the WWW address is:
http://mathsun1.math.utk.edu:8000/~siddhart/thirukkural

For the American English (Hinduism Today, Hawaii) verison:
http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~janahan/kural/kural-body.html
They have done a fairly good job of translation. Only
aRattuppAl and poruTpAl are there. They leave out kAmattuppAl.
