Horace Hayman Wilson's translation, bearing the title _The ViSNu
PuraaNa. A System of Hindu Mythology and Tradition Translated from the
Original Sanskrit and Illustrated by Notes Derived Chiefly from Other
PuraaNas_, was published in 1840, the first complete translation of a
PuraaNa into a European language. I assume it must be the translation
read by Emerson, as being the only one available in the philosopher's
lifetime.
