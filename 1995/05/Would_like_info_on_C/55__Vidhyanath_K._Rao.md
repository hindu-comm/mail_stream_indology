Hello,

I have tried to get the descriotion of the CSX encoding, with no success.
Archie, Veronica and South Asia Gopher give no pointers to it. There is
a partial description in the ITRANS package; it also refers to a file
called iass.zip whose existence archie and veronica deny.

If CSX is some kind of properitary format that is not meant to public,
then also please let me know so that I would not pursue this any further.

I greatly appreciate any help.
