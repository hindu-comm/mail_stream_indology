The "Sanskrit" form  *yogyaacaarya is cited as equivalent to Pali
yoggaacariya (which does exist).  My question:  does this Skt. term
actually exist?  I have not been able to find it.

In which text is the term "Bharat" first used to denote a geographical 
entity? Could someone provide the exact citation?
