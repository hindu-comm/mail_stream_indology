Does anyone know of a textual reference which would describe the "sporting" or 
"sport" of the gods in the deva or heavenly realms?  I am looking for a passage 
to use in the dedication of my master's thesis, and it would be extremely 
appropriate if I could find something in this league.  The word "sport" (or 
equivalent) is of utmost importance in the sentiment of the dedication.

Thanks for your kind help.
