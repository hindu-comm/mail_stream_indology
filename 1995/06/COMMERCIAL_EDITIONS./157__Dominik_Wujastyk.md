Yes.  This is very much the issue addressed by Martin L. West in his
excellent little book "Textual Criticism and Editorial Technique"
(Stuttgart: Teubner, 1973), explicitly written to replace Maas's
"Textkritik" in order to take account of contamination and other
factors that make Maas's "pure" system inapplicable in so many
real-world cases.  I always tell my students to read West before doing
anything with Sanskrit manuscripts.
