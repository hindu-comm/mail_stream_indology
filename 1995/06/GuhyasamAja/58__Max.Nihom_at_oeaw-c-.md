Subject: SARVANGI OF GOPALDAS

          "The Sarvangi  of Gopaldas; a  17th  century anthology of  Bhakti 
          literature" was published by Manohar in Delhi  in  1993.  What  I 
          assume is the same book, "The Sarvangi of  the Dadupanthi Rajab," 
          was  published  in  Leuven  by  the  Departement  Orientalistiek, 
          Katholieke  Universitet,  in  1978,  as   v.   4   in  Orientalia 
          Lovaniensia analecta.

Subject: NAME FOR A BABY GIRL

          I  looked  in  Monier-Williams' English-Sanskrit  dictionary  and 
          examined the words meaning "free" or "unrestrained" or the like.  
          Unfortunately I think most  of  them when given a feminine ending 
          would come across with the implication that the girl was  a loose 
          woman.  This might seem sexist but then I don't recall seeing any 
          of them in the masculine as personal names, and searched a sample 
          of them and indeed they didn't show up as personal names of men.  
          Being unrestrained except in limited contexts, it seems,  is  not 
          desirable for either sex.   I suspect Aniruddha, "not held back," 
          refers very specifically to  his not being able to  be restrained 
          in battle.  (Of course there's the widespread problem or attitude 
          that someone who's a  good fighter may  be hard to hold back when 
          he should restrain himself, a problem dealt with in India and  in 
          Homer).  Might I suggest instead Aparajita, "unvanquished," which 
          is established  as  a  female  name  and  doesn't  have  the  bad 
          implications mentioned above?
