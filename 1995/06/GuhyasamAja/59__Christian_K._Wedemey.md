	A complete translation of chapters I to XVII (i.e. excluding the
Uttaratantra) of the Guhyasamajatantra comprises the first part of
Francesca Fremantle's doctoral dissertation which was completed at the
University of London in (I believe) 1971.  She also presents her own
critical edition of the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, conveniently placed on
facing pages.  This work may be borrowed through Interlibrary loan
services.
