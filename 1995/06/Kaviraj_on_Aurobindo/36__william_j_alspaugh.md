To members of Indology:  One of our patrons at the U. of Chicago library has
information that Gopinath Kaviraj has written something on Sri Aurobindo. 
This might be an article or something in one of Kaviraj's philosophical
works.  Does anyone have any information on any such writing by Kaviraj?  
Thanks for any info you can supply.  Bill Alspaugh, U. of Chicago South Asia Collection.
