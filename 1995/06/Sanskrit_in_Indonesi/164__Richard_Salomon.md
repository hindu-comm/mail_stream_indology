I will be going to Bali, and possibly also Java, later this summer for 
what is essentially  
a vacation trip, but it's hard to get away from Sanskrit.  Does anyone 
have any information on the state of Sanskrit language or studies there?  
Does anyone know of any scholars or pandits who might be 
interested in talking to foreign Sanskritists?

P.S. I will be in England for the whole month of July, and probably not 
on e-mail.  Will respond to messages, if any, upon my return in August.
