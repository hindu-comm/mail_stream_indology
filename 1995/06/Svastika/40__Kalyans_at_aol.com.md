Quote from Wilson's glossary:

saThIA H., sAthIo Guz. A figure made by Hindu women in place of a signature
to written deeds: a kind of figured cross prefixed to account books, and also
formed with flour on the ground at marriages and other festivals: a surgeon.

I suggest that this refers to a hyper-sanskritism: svastikA. This term has to
be elucidated in the search for ancient etyma (and phonetic forms), because
the figure is prominent in the Indus-Sarasvati (or Indus) script
inscriptions. Any comments?
