I strongly recommend Eli Franco's book PERCEPTION, KNOWLEDGE AND
DISBELIEF: A STUDY OF JAYARAASI'S SCEPTICISM, 2nd ed, Motilal
Banarsidass, 1994.  The book contains an introduction, analysis, edition,
critical notes and translation of the Tattvopaplavasimha, which may be
the sole surviving text of the Caarvaaka-Lokaayata school.
