I am afraid that these Tibetan fonts were never created in METAFONT
format.  The PK files are direct translations from 300 dpi bitmaps
in another bitmap format.  :-(  Sorry.

The Free Software Foundation does have tools for converting bitmap
fonts into outline format, but doing this is a very non-trivial
task, and probably requires a unix workstation.
