Dear colleagues,

I usually use the TeX System. I got the Tibetan-TeX from 
this Library. But this package has not various fonts. It 
has only 300dpi. I would like to get the Source Program of 
these fonts (maybe METAFONT). And then, are there Sources 
of this Tibetan Preprocessor ? If somebody knows about this, 
would you please tell me.

I greatly appreciate any help. Thank you.
