I am working on the life and contributions of Horace Hayman Wilson 
(1786-1860).  I would be grateful for any suggestions about sources, 
themes, or assessments of his influence as a scholar of Indian 
religions.  I am principally interested in his life and work as a 
cultural broker between Hindus, East India Company officials, 
missionaries, and his construction of Hinduism.  I am less concerned 
about the state of his knowledge of Sanskrit literature, though I would 
appreciate any assessments from Sanskritist colleagues in this regard.  
As a historian of religions I am particularly interested in the moment of 
cultural contact that occurred between 1793 and 1830.  Wilson is a 
significant player durig the latter part of this period and beyond.  
Recommendations as to sources, archives, family history, and his career 
with the  East India Company Library, Oxford University, and the Royal 
Asiatic Society would be much appreciated.
