Dear Colleagues,

I am looking for the largest collections of nyAyas (maxims, examples)
available either in printed or manuscript form. They often prove to be
an unvaluable help for understanding the gist of the arguments within
which they occur. 
I have already got in my personal or Department library:
G.A. Jacob, LaukikanyAyAJjali
S.B. Singh, NyAyAvali
Chavinath Mizra, NyAyoktikoza.
The latter often refers to one NyAyasAhasrI. Does anybody know where
I can find this text ? Any information about this and other texts of this
kind will be welcome.
