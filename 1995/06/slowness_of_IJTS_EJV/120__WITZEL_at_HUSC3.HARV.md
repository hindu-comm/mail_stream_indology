Regarding difficulties to get a connection at Milano or the slowness of 
such connections I heard the same during my recent lecture tour in East 
Asia from some of my Japanese friends.

Personally, I never had a problem when I checked the WWW pages by "Netscape" 
from Cambridge/Mass. and I get (also today) an immediate connection. 
By modem, of course, this will be rather slow.

However, to alleviate the problem apparently existing for some users we 
will try to establish some mirror sites in strategical locations on 
various continents.

I will keep you informed. --
