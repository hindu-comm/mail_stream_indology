            If it is Professor John Brough of Cambridge University that 
you want, I am sorry to say that he passed away a number of years ago.
                                  Yours sincerely,

Dear Members,
Does anyone know of any ATM type 1 fonts for Nastaliq script? It is not hard 
to get fonts for Naskh script but I am looking for something to write Urdu 
in and wonder what resources there are available.
