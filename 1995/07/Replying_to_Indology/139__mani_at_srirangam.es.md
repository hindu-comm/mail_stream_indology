May I request the Indology list administrator
to change the Reply-To: field that is added
to all Indology mail messages? We have far too
often seen personal messages go out to everyone
on Indology. This may not bother some, but I
already receive far too much email, and the 
less the better.  If Reply-To: contained the
address of the sender, we would avoid this
problem.

Thanks,
Mani
