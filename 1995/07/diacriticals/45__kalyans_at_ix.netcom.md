The following information may be useful.

Subject: Devanagari

(this is a font for use with Sanskrit, Hindi, etc.)
Created by Frans Velthuis in 1987/88 and is available 
from him (Velthuis%hgrrug5.earn at cunyvm.cunyvm.edu) 
for a small charge.
Another address is "velthuis at hgrrug5.bitnet".
        F.J. Velthuis,
        Nyensteinheerd 267
        9736 TV Groningen
        The Netherlands

Also available as part of his Devanagari 
transliteration package:
ftp: june.cs.washington.edu tex/devnag.tar.Z, or 
devnag.zip

You could also try, these, although I don't know if 
they are the same:
ftp: BLACKBOX (see 
introduction):/pub/indic/outlines/vnagari.*

ftp: ctan: tex-archive/language/devanagari/*
