Try contacting Compurserve. I know several people who have compuserve
accounts in India (local calls by modem) which seem to work well at
least for email access. I'm not sure if compuserve's plans to provide
wider internet access (gopher, WWW, ftp, newsgroups, etc) to their
clientele include their Indian branch.
