>>PED further equates the term with "gabbhapariharana",
>>which at Vism 500 in fact seems to me closer in meaning   
>>"gestation". My question is whether there is in fact
>>a formal gabbhaparihaara ceremony? If so, what is
>>the Hindu/Sanskrit equivalent? Any additional references
>>to such a ritual would be appreciated.

The very first in the list of Hindu sa.mskAras or rituals
is "garbhAdAna" referring to gestation or conception...

I saw one example of a mantra connected with this ritual
in Frits Staal's paper in the book
