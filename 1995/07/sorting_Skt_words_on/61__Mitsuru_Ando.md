 Dear colleagues,
 I am wondering whether it is possible to sort words in the Sanskrit
alphabetical order on Macintosh. As far as I know, no wordprocessors or
texteditors can provide such utilities.
 Could any of you please let me know if there are any applications or macro-
programs working on Macintosh which will enable me to specify the order in
which words will be sorted.   Thank you very much in advance.
                                        Mitsuru ANDO
