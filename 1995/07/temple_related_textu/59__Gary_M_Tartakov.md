I find Daud AliUs question on Sankara and its responses interesting on
the issue of the philosophical or theological grounding of the great stone
the temple tradition.  

I am interested in what they and others on
*Indology* can offer as sources for further investigation of the textual
traditions that actually apply to temple building before and after
Sankara.  

Which are those most important today?
