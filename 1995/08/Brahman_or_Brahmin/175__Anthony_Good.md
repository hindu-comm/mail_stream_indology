According to Chambers dictionary (as usual, much more helpful
in these matters!) Brahman and Brahmin are alternative spellings,
likewise Brahmanic, Brahminic.  *However, the -min ending is
indicated to be derogatory.* I must say that, like many others, I 
have always used the -man ending, though not as far I can remember 
for that specific reason, so this whole debate seems to be based
on a false premise.
