The Oxford English Dictionary confirms that Brahmin is an English
word.  Interestingly, it says "some of the older Eng. forms were
derived from or influenced by the Greek spelling
<beta rho alpha chi mu alpha nu epsilon sigma> (pl.), Latin brachmaani, -es,
and Medieval Latin corruptions.  The form Brahmin, a corruption of the 
Indian vernacular pronunciation ...".  

The first citation seems to be "Bramini" in 1553 (the earlier 1481
citation is "bragman").
