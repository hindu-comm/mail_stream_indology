	I am not a wiz in either Nagari or in computer software, but I have 
found a program called "Compose" to be very useful for the problem you
describe. It is a small, simple, free shareware program which inserts any 
character (including characters with ansi codes highrer than 127).
	You run the program in the background in windows and it is activated
every time you press a special hot-key (any key you like, e.g. right ctl.).
You then simply type b for example and the program will insert for example 
the code for the dma conjunct in your font.  Compose is then automatically de-
ctivated and you go on typing normally untill you need to insert another 
conjunct not on the ordinary keyboard.  At that point you hit the right control
key again followed this time by say M and the program inserts say the code 
for hma in your nagari font.
	Of course before you start you must configure it to the codes for
your particular font (unfortunately there is absolutely no standard).
You can use keys which seem logical and the program works for most windows applications..                                           

	I have been using it for two years and cannot find fault with it.
When you get used to it you can type very quickly with it especiall if you
map your key board logically. 

This is what the blurb says in the help menu:

"Copyright � 1991-1992 by Digital Equipment Corporation.
All Rights Reserved.

"The supported Windows method for entering a character not
found on the keyboard is to hold down the Alt
key while typing a value on the numeric keypad. Not only must
you know the numeric value for the
character that you want to enter, in some cases, you must
press and hold multiple keys at once.

"The Compose application provides a simpler alternative by
giving you:


--  quick access to characters not found on your keyboard
--  application independent access to the current date and
time
--  the ability to view, select from, and print out all the
characters of a font
--  the ability to print samples of all available printer fonts"


I don't know where you can get it from.  If you are interested I could
get it put on the Coombs archives here at ANU.
