A quibble. Surely such figures should not be quoted (in an academic
context, at least). Clearly, if the annual income of the average Indian was
~$360, then the average Indian would be dead within three months ! This
kind of figure is a rather misleading artefact of exchange rates. I have
seen even more absurd figures quoted for Africa.
