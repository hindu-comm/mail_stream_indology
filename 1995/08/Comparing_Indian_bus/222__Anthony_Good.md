I can certainly confirm Joydeep Mitra's comments from personal field 
experience.  A relatively well-paid manual labourer in a small South India town 
in the mid-80s might get Rs30-40 per day.  They would have to work 290 days per 
annum at Rs 40 to earn $360.  Clerical workers might be even worse off; temple 
staff earned around Rs300 per month (admittedly with some meals as an extra).  
Surely there is no controversy whatever over this kind of figure, and I cannot 
understand why Lance Cousins finds them hard to believe.
