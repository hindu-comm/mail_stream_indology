This tallies quite nicely with information I received in 1985, when a
riksha-wallah in Agra told me they made about 30-40 rupees a day. A driver
told me he earned 400 Rs a month. The interesting question is, however: How
much do 40 rupees buy - locally?  Does anybody have an idea about how this
translates into food, heating, shelter etc.?

Does anyone know if the British Museum, specifically the South Asia

Thanks
