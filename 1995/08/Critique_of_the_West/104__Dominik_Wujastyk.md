Dear Sadhunathan,

Yes, I think that probably is what I was thinking of.  The "from the 
publisher's desk" is what I think of as the editorial, and the date,
Jan 94, is about right, I think.

Actually, I went off HT earlier, and wasn't a subscriber when the
timeline issue came up.  I also read the big book by Sivaya
Subramuniaswami on Saivism, when it first came out.

Incidentally, I was completely unaware that HT ever published any letter
from me.  I don't think I wrote to them ... oh, wait a minute, I did
send a bit of email, which never got acknowledged, so I assumed it had
fallen into some big hole in the net.  That must be it.  I certainly
didn't intend my note for publication!  Oh dear.  Was it very strident?

Best wishes,
Dominik
