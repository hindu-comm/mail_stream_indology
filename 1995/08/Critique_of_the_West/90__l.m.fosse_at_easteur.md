Thank you for your answer to my inquiry. It is an interesting text which I
didn't know, and it seems quite "genuine". This is the sort of stuff a
Brahmin ascetic might actually have said (although certain Greek
philosophers like Diogenes (of the famous barrel) would certainly chime
in). I'll pass it on to my colleague!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
