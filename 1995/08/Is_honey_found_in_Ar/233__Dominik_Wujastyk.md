Arka can be Calotropis gigantea (Linn.) R. Br. or (rarely) Calotropis
procera R. Br.  The former is found "distributed throughout India,
especially in the south.  It is very common on roadsides and in waste
places in all plain districts.  Also distributed in Sri Lanka, China,
and Malaysia."

C. procera is more commonly given as the plant for the name alarka, but
there is confusion.  C. procera is "common in the drier parts of India,
[but] it is conspicuously absent in Kerala."
