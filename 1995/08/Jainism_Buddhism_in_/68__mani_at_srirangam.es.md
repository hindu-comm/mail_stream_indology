Naga Ganesan writes:
* Later Hinduism absorbed/appropriated several traits of Buddhism.
* Sankara was called "prasanna bauddha (hidden buddhist)" by Ramanuja.

I have mentioned this before, but I must correct this error.
Ramanuja has never used the term "prachanna bauddha" to describe
Sankara or his followers, though Vedanta Desika, his follower 
of a couple centuries later, does so.

The term is most often used in polemic literature of the Dvaita
school, beginning with Anandatirtha.
