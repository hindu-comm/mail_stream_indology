I take the points you made about the importance of Tamil culture, but
the above statement is not a valid inference from them.  One can defend
anything one wishes, surely?  Teachers of Sanskrit in non-Indian
universities must perforce think hard about how to defend their status
and budgets against the constant pressure of competition from other
subjects.  So must teachers of Tamil, Indian religion, art, Pali, etc.
etc.
