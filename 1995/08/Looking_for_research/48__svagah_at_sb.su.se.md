Does anyone know the É-mail or postal addresses to;
Surinder M. Bhardwaj, the former Chairman in the Department of Geography at
Kent State University?

and / or to;
Carolyn V. Prorok

I would also appreciate to get in contact with anthropologists that
currenly or previously have done research on Hindu women in the UK. Also,
any titles of new publications or articles on this subject would be
gratefully recieved. Please, as not to upset others on the list, answer
direct to my É-mail address.
Thank you!

Hopeful regards

Elizabeth Hole  (svagah at sb.su.se)
