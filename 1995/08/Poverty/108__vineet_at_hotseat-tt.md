Hello,
	I am not a historian or otherwise but it is a widely accepted
fact in India that the invasions are the real cause of poverty.
	India was called a "golden bird" before all these invasions.
People were happy. Look at all the stories about India. None or almost
none seems to indicate people were unhappy or poor. And look at the
stories of post-independence. You need to emphasize or explain people
that there are still rich people in India.

	An indirect resoning and also the most unfortunate part is that
today "existence"/money has taken over spirituality in India.  An empty
stomach can't think of writing shakuntalam or Gita.


Best Regards,
vineet.
