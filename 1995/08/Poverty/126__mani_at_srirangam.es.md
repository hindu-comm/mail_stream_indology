As an aside, since when has it become standard to use "Z"
for the first "sha" (I forget its technical name) in 
transliteration when diacritics are not available? It is
a most confusing convention.  Why not use "S" for the first
"sha" and "sh" for the second? This is what I have always
done, and it has the advantage of not being visually jarring
to the reader.
