The satires of K.semendra, although he may well have been somewhat 
of a bigot, are a particularily useful antidote to 
romantic notions of poverty. His Kalaavilaasa is a "fine" portrayal human 
degradation (I would suggest reading the text rather more carefully than 
the tranlations of Richard Schmidt and Pranee Lapanich do, a lot of the 
humour depends on dvyaa"sraya- or occasionally tryaa"sraya"sle.sa).
