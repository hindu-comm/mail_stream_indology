I am urgently seeking publicatio details of a paper by Alexis Sanderson,
"Meaning in Tantric Ritual", dated 1988, which was to appear in A.
-M. Blondeau & K. Schipper (ed) Essais sur le Rituel III, Louvain-Paris:
Peeters. However, I don't think volume III ever appeared. Prof Sanderson
is away and I need to know by tomorrow. The telephone no. of anyone who
might know this information would be helpful, at least.
