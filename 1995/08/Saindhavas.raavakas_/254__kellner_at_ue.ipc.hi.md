Anantalal Thakur, in his preface to the Jn.aanas.riimitranibandhaavalii, 
reports a "deadly quarrel" between the Saindhavas.raavakas and the
Tantrayaanists
in Bengal, some time (no dates given) around 1000/1100 A.D. He also reports
that "it is said" (by whom, he doesn't say) that Jn.aanas.riimitra himself
was first a Saindhavas.raavaka
and then became a Tantrayaanists. 

All this strikes me as rather odd, in particular because I do not have the
slightest idea what these two expressions referred to (i.e. what the sects
or groups
denoted by these terms stood for, and what they might have quarreled about). 

Any ideas or references would, as usual, be greatly appreciated.

I came upon references to the 'Saindhavas.raavakas' in stories by Taranatha 
concerning Bodh Gaya (in a book that I think was called 'The origin of the 
Tara tradition' translated by David Templeman). They were according to 
Taranatha SriLankan Buddhists who violently opposed the Tantric Buddhists 
and, if I remember right, rioted and beat up Tantric Buddhists and tore down 
images of Tantric deities.
