The subject-line already clarifies what I would like to know. I only know of
pts. I-III having been published by S.aambas.iva S.aastri (I & II) and
Ramasvaami S.aastri (III) respectively (Trivandrum 1926, 1929 and 1943).
However, I have the urgent desire to read what Sucarita wrote on the
s.abdanityataadhikaran.a of the S.lokavaartika, and that is not part of
these three volumes. 
Can my wish be fulfilled? If not, is that because he never wrote anything or
because the manuscripts are locked in somewhere behind the seven seas?
