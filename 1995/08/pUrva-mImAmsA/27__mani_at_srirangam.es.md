Someone asked a while back about the
usage of the term pUrva-mImAmsA, and
whether it is actually used by classical
Vedantins. From reading that I have
done lately of materials from the
Visistadvaita school, it appears that
the term is current from at least the
time of Sudarsana Suri (12th century), 
the acclaimed author of the SrutiprakASika
commentatary on Ramanuja's SribhAshya. 
However, I cannot find the term in Ramanuja's
own works, though admittedly I do not
have the full text of the SribhAshya at
my disposal.

Sudarsana Suri's junior contemporary 
Vedanta Desika seems to prefer the term
Karma-mImAmsA. Perhaps this is because
he views the two mImAmsAs as being even
more tightly coupled together than either
Ramanuja or Sudarsana.
