There is a 7-bit encoding for Devanagari that is used in Frans
Velthuis's Devanagari system for TeX and, being simple and logical, it
is sometimes used in email too.

Where can I find the whole system? It seems useful, even though I don't use
TeX, or  even know what it is, for that matter.

Hello
Not only has every Devanagari font I have ever used has had a different 
encoding but also every Devanagari font I have seen uses a different 
encoding.
