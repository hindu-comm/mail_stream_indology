I rather agree. My own particular complaint is that this system rules out
using capital letters for punctuation, as is normal in many areas of
Buddhist studies which use romanized text. So as far as I am concerned, it
is unusable.

          On artifacts of exchange rates,  my  personal favorite  was  some 
          news report on the difficulties in Ethiopia.  It said the average 
          income for a college professor for $100 a month but that he would 
          have  100 unemployed relatives dependent on  him.   Either buying 
          power is awesome or their metabolisms are incredibly efficient.
