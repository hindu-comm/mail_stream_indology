If you do an archie search for devnag, you should be able to find its
location. If not, let me know and I can find out for you. TeX is a
document typesetting system (public domain) written by Donald Knuth of
Stanford University. Although originally developed to typeset
technical documents (hence the name TeX, pronounced tech), it has
proved to be useful to typeset other kinds of documents, including
documents in other languages.
