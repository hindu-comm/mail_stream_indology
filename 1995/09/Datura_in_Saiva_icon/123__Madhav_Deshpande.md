At least going by the Marathi usage, Datura, which is probably the same 
as Marathi Dhotraa, Skt. Dhattuura, is quite different from Mogara.  
Dhotraa is a very large flower, each petal the length of a human finger.  
Secondly, it has no fragrance.  Mogara is obviously fragrant.  The 
Mogara, at least in its fragrance and shape is similar to another flower 
called Jaai (Skt. Jaati) as well as a flower called Jui (Skt. Dyuti?).  
It is interesting to note that the word Jaati (Marathi: Jaai) appears in 
the lists of flowers and leaves to be offered at the special worship of 
Ganesha and Gauri.  These lists, which I have at home, but not with me at 
the moment, also include Dhattuura, but I don't remember anything 
sounding like Mogara, unless it appears there under an unrelated Sanskrit 
name.
