>My name is Michael Doliveck and I am applying for a Fulbright Student
>Fellowship to India for 1996.  I am a graduate student at Bowling Green State
>University in Ohio, U.S.A.  I am also an artist who works in stone and
>bronze.   ------  CUT   -------
  I am seeking an official affiliation with an educational or
>artistic institution in India.  As part of my application, I
>need a letter of invitation  from an institution that would offer to act
>as my host while in India.  This affiliation would not financially
>obligate the host institution because my Fulbright Fellowship would cover
>my expenses.
