There is quite a lot of relevant stuff available via the INDOLOGY web
page or gopher.  Try
        http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html,
or just ftp to
        ftp.bcc.ac.uk:/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology
where you will find directories /software and /texts.  The first has
some nice CSX-compliant roman fonts in both truetype and postscript
versions.
