> I have heard also the name Amla connected to some sort of mango tree.
> Thus my confusion is extreme. Any experts on amla?

Mango is called "Amra" in Skt., Am in Hindi, mAnkAi (mAmpazham) in Tamil. 
The confusion is probably because of the similarity in sound. I'm sure there
is no connection with Amla. 

Amla is always identified with myrobalam, I thought. There should be lots 
of Ayurvedic sources for Amla.
