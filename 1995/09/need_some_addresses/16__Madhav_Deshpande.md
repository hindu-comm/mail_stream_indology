Friends,
	I would be grateful if any of you could provide me with addresses 
(snail-mail/e-mail/phone???) for the following scholars:

1.	Tatyaya Elizarenkova, Russsia

2.	J.P. Mallory, author of "In Search of Indo-Europeans." 
	(Belfast?)

3.	V.I. Sarianidi.  An archaeologist who has worked on Turkmenia and Iran.
	Russia?  One of the Central Asian Republics?

	I need to be able to get in touch with these folks very quickly.  
Any help will earn you your desires in heaven (svarge loke kaamadhug 
bhavati).
	All the best,
			Madhav Deshpande
