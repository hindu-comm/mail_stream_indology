I am currently preparing a volume on palaeographical problems mainlz within the
 range of the modern and earlz modern scripts of South Asia. So far I have coll
ected three contributions (Khojki script, scripts of the chancellery of Eastern
 Rajasthan, Maldivian script). Who would like to contribute to this volume, too
? Mss should not exceed 50 pp. Graphic documentation (script charts etc.) are w
elcome. The volume will appear in the series Khoj, Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz
. Papers should preferably be in English.
