It might be interesting to note that Johannes Hertel in his Einleitung to
his Tantraakhyaayika says p. XXIV § 2. Schreibung und Satzzeichen under 1
b: "Zischlaut, Upaadhmaaniiya und Jihvaamuuliiya verwende ich mit den
Handschriften statt des im eigentlichen Indien ueblichen Vsarga" (I am
using the sibilants, u´s and j´s as the MSS do instead of the of the usual
visarga in India itself) - he´s of course referring to the Kashmiri
recensions.
