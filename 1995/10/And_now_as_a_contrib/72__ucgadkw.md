I thought you might enjoy this recent posting to comp.fonts.  Surely
"EnVeda" must become the standard font for INDOLOGY discussions. :-)

Yes Indeed, InProS's font Indinglish is exactly this font.

Indinglish font was recently used by AT&T in a major advertising
campaign.

Many of the wedding invitations for Indian marraiges in Eastern and
SouthWestern US are prepared using Indinglish and our Indian language
fonts.

You can see a sample of it at

This is a pretty good description of it. Indinglish has succeeded in
capturing all of these featuures. 

We will soon be releasing another English font called EnVeda which
will also capture look and feel of Sanskrit script in a unique way,
Tentative release date January 14th 1996.
