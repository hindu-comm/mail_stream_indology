My wife and I will be going to Madras early next year. I would like to
purchase some sanskrit books while I'm there.

Does anyone have recommendations regarding indological bookstores? Does
Motilal have a store in Madras? Is the Adyar Library still alive and well?

Any advice would be most welcome. Thank you all.
