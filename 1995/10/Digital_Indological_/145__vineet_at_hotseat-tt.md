I have been thinking of all and even more than you have talked about. I think
it is a great thing to do. The only question for me is when to start 
developing this (I am a comp. engg.). The answer is sometime within a year.
I am interested in doing this because I believe it will help everybody. But
it is good to put the question before the community so that they can
give their feedback. I would also like to work with various people.
