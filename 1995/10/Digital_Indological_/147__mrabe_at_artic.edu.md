There's an apropos cartoon in this week's New Yorker (Oct 16th, p. 128):  a
worried hostess turns from glum guests to her husband and exclaims,"Oh,
Lord! We forgot to invite any content providers."

Like MYST, indological best sellers (of the future--come quicklyl) will
probably be authored by individuals or small teams with real vision for the
medium.  And like better museum exhibitions, accompanied by scholarly
catalogs, they'll have to aim for an extremely wide band of potential
viewers--not just the bottom end like too many currently on the market.
