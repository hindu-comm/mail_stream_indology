Dominik makes a beautiful point. A substantial part of the older works, such
as the Niruktam, for example, tend to make emphatic statements with little
sociolinguistic analysis. I can think of a more recent example. Madhav M. 
Deshpande's Sanskrit and Prakrit: Sociolinguistic issues. With undue emphasis
on grammar (pANiNi et al.), the bhASA is relegated to the lowly prakrt 
speaking comedians in a few dramas. I am sure our members of indology can
throw more light on the analytical works for the prakrts.
