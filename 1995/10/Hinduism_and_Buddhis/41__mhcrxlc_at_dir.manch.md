This is no chance that the term bodhi-sattva was present 'during the early
vedic age', as this is almost certainly a mistaken backformation from
Middle Indian bodhi-satta, in fact derived from bodhi-sakta. It is likely,
however, that terms such as arhat, jina, kevalin, etc. existed prior to the
formation of Budddhism or Jainism as we know them.
