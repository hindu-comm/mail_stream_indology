What "strange results" are you referring to? I usually convert from WP 5.1
to Winword - 
naturally, the extended character sets are different, so I have to first
convert the WP5.1-diacritics into some ASCII-convention (such as "a@" for
long a), read the file in WinWord and then run a macro which converts the
ASCII-preliminaries into the TTF-font. 

Otherwise, I have never perceived any "strange results" (not even when
converting from WP 5.1 to WordPerfect for Windows 6.0aJ).
