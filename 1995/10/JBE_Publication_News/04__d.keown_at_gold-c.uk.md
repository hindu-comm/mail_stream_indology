ABSTRACT

     This essay examines some current concerns of socially engaged
Buddhists in the West. How does one practice nonviolence in one's own
life and in the world? How can the demands of "inner" and "outer" work
be reconciled? What framework should be used in assessing the effects
of Buddhist-inspired activism? Today's engaged Buddhists do not refer
extensively to Buddhism's ethical tradition, and some of their
activities may not appear to be distinctively Buddhist. Nonetheless,
their efforts reflect a longstanding Mahaayaana ideal -- that
transcendental wisdom is actualized most meaningfully in compassionate
action.

Dear members of the list
This enquiry is directed mainly at those of you who use descriptive 
catalogues of manuscripts in Sanskrit, Hindi and other languages.

Some catalogues give greatest prominence to *a catalogue serial number* for 
each entry. (i.e. British Library catalogues, Tripathi's catalogue of the 
Strasbourg Jaina MSS)

A few catalogues give greatest prominence to the *MS number* for each entry. 
(i.e. Blumhardt and Master's catalogue of Gujarati and Rajasthani 
manuscripts in the IOL)   

My question is this, which system do you find preferable or easier to use?
[I ask this because I am about to publish a catalogue of Hindi Manuscripts 
in the library here and wonder which system to adopt.]
