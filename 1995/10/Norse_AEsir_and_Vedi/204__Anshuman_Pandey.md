Members,

Is the Norse word for god, AEsir, a cognate of the Vedic, Asura? Does 
the AE in AEsir represent a negation of the word sir, as the a does for 
asura? I am wondering this because asura and AEsir are names for the 
older generation of deities in the Vedic writings and Eddic and other 
Norse writing, and am curious to know whether there is any common ground 
between the two.

Thanks.

Anshuman Pandey
