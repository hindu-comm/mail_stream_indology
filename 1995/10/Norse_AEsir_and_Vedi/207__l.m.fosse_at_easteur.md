> _Asura_ as a-sura is believed to be a false etymology dating from the
> upanishadic period, when it accordingly led to the creation of a new
> word for "gods", _sura_, not attested in older texts.

> The word stems in all probability from _asu_ "vital breath" + _ra_,
> meaning something like "master of vital breath", and as such it is
> indeed cognate to Norse _ass_ (pl. aesir) (as well as to Avestic
> _ahura_).
