Our library doesn't have this article - neither does any in the
country.  I figure email would be faster than placing an overseas
interloan request.  So I would greatly appreciate it if someone who
already has this article can mail, fax, ftp or email an electronic
version of it:

J.F.Fleet, The katapayadi system of expressing numbers, Journal
of the Royal Asiatic Society (JRAS), 1911, p.788-794.

Many thanks in advance.
