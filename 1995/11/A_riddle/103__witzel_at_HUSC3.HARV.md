The verse is RV 7.59.12 in almost good transcription, save the long 
vowels and minus the accents. Plus OM at the beginning.

Such things can be found out in a minute in Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance.

The verse (Mrtyumjauaya) is a later addition to te RV hymns, and it is alos 
found in the so-called Sivasamkalpa Up.
