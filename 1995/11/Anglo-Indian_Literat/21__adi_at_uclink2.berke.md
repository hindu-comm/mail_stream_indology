The Central Institute for English and Foreign Languages in Hyderabad is a
good place, and I'm sure some work is done there on Indian literature in
English. I assume this is what you mean by Anglo-Indian lit, or perhaps you
are talking about literature by Britons in India (pre-1857), or by those of
mixed English and British parentage (post 1857)? The term Anglo-Indian
carries all these valences,

Best,
