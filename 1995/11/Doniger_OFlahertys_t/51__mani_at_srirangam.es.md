With errors such as those pointed out by Dr. Witzel,
I as a non-specialist shudder to think of what kind
of erroneous notions such mistranslations propagate.

Considering that the Rg Veda is held as sacred 
by many Indians, it seems obvious that a translator 
should either use a traditional interpretation or a 
carefully researched, scholarly understanding of
the text.  Otherwise, the translation serves no use 
at all.
