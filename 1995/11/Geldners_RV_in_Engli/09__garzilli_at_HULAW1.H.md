Any good translator into any language should take into account
all the previous translations, especially if they are good (and above all 
when the languages involved are German and English).  
I am sure that Insler, knowing also Italian (very well, BTW:)), will also 
read and consider the good Italian translation of some hymns of:

V. Papesso, Inni del Rg Veda, Roma, Astrolabio, 1979.
