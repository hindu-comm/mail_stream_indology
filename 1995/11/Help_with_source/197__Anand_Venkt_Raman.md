This is Incredible - My sister told me this "old sanskrit poem" last
week, and that she used it in a toast recently. I asked her the
source but she didn't know where "exactly" she got it from. But it
sounded nice, so I wrote it down and came back to Palmerston North
with the idea of posting it to the list sometime asking if someone
knew where it first occurs!!!!

As far as I know my sister isn't doing a course on Indian Buddhism.
I'll believe that it was quoted in Reader's Digest, though.  Seems
very likely.

Cheers.
