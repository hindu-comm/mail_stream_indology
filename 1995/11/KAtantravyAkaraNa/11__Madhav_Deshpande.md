There is a book in Sanskrit by Janaki Prasad Dvivedi titled: 
Kaatantra-VyaakaraNa-VimarSaH, published from Banaras.  This book refers 
to a number of commentaries on Durga among many other works.  From what I 
remember, some of these were published from Calcutta in Bengali 
characters, and may be found in Calcutta libraries such as the Calcutta 
Sanskrit College, Asiatic Society, and the Central Reference Library.
