Members of Indology,

I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin and am in desparate
need for an English translation of the Madala Panji.  Unfotunately, I have
been unable to find any translations.  If anyone could provide assistance
or a citation, I would be very grateful.

Sincerly,

Michael Bednar
