Aditya Dev Sood's perspective on Rushdie was quite helpful.  Rushdie 
has been making a place for himself in what may (with some risk) be 
called the literature of migrancy or the literature of border-crossings.  
His collection of occasional pieces, Imaginary Homelands, is a valuable 
complement to the novels and draws out some of the implications of being 
a modern migrant or emigre.
