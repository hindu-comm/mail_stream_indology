The Asian Studies Centre's URL here has been changed. It is now:
	http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/asian_studies

Those of you who have been kind enough to link with us, would you please 
update your link. Thank you very much. The latest update to our web site 
was in the middle of October, just before our 3-week strike.

Thank you for contributing some human humor! The discussion was very dry indeed.
I also enjoyed the cocktail party joke. Anything wrong with being less serious?
Is it necessary that the academic world is dry and inaccessible?  What about a
lush garden with juicy plants and beautiful flowers? Errare humanum est, and
smiling too is human.
Thank you for all your wonderful and honest contributions.
