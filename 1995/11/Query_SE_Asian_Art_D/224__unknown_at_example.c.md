          Cambodian or Indonesian Art & Dance Video??
          ********************************************

I have a query: 
>From Southeast Asia - especially Indonesia(Bali) and Cambodia and Thailand,
want to borrow some videos on temples, sculpture, dances, etc.,

Especially the Khmer dance. I am also very interested in looking at 
Ramayana panels from Khmer temples, Thai sculpture and also 
from Indonesian sites.

Any suggestions?!

Yours
