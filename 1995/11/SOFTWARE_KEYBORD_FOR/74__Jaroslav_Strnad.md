Dear colleagues,

recently we have bought from the Ecological Linguistics their Devanagari 
fonts for Windows that look very fine but unfortunately are supplied 
without software keyboard (on our complaint E.L. explained that it is able 
to supply softwarwe keyboards only for their Macintosh version). Before we 
start devising our own - a pretty laborious task - we would like to know 
whether this sort of thing does not already exist as a shareware. We shall 
be grateful for any hint or advice.
