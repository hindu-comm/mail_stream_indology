Ladies and Gentlemen,
As I was in a hurry I wrote quite a big rubbish about a font I have and
can't find a short u. I beg all of you for your very pardon, being
disturbed by this message of mine; it was a miss look. The font I have is a
Hindi font.
Unfortunately all other fonts I found and have been told of where post
script fonts, which I am not able to use on my Printer.
