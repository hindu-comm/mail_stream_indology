Yes, you are right. But the exact date was not so important, I thought, in 
the context of Leonard's question: these two Tibetan monks were much later. 
Also whether Bhartrhari was Buddhist or not has long being debated (J.Takakusu 1896, 
J.Filliozat  1954, H.Nakamura  in JGGRI 28, and D.D. Kosambi, Ingalls etc. 
etc.).
In practice everything, every small dot, on the one/two Bhartrhari has 
been debated. But still.....
