This is in response to a recent query concerning summer study programs in
India. Taxila Academy, a new program in Bangalore, India, which offers 
introductory courses in: 

Language Study

It has been organized by students and professors at the University of 
Chicago, Oxford, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University.

If anyone is interested, I can provide more information.
