RE:  SEARCH FOR AUTHORS ON SOUTH ASIANS IN AFRICA

Dr. Margaret Mills and Dr. Peter Clause are presently looking for authors 
to write on the topic of Diaspora Studies in Africa for the South Asian 
Folklore: Encyclopedia.  If you know of any scholars who might be 
interested, please forward their names and addresses to me 
(sdiamond at sas.upenn.edu).

Thank You,
