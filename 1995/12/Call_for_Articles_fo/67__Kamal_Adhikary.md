Dear Collegues,
	I am an anthropologist.  My area is south Asian languages and 
cultures.  I joined the 'indology mailing list' a couple of weeks ago, 
and I am enjoying the ongoing debate on the Indian politics that has been 
posted almost daily for the past few days.  I am sure I will contribute 
something soon.  For now I like to post a call for paper for 'Sagar, 
South Asia Journal'.  The detail is given below.  I hope you will respond 
to it.  Thank you.

Rigveda 1.50

His shining beams now introduce
the God who knows all living things,
that all may see the Sun.

Accompanying the somber Night,
the stars, like thieves, now steel away
at the all-seeing Sun's approach.
His herald rays are seen from far,
shining on the homes of men like tongues
of fire that burn and blaze.

Swift and beautiful are you,
O Sun, maker of the Light, who illumines
all the radiant sky.

You shine upon the hosts of Gods
and likewise on the race of men, that all
may see the heavenly Light.

You steer your path across the sky,
O Sun, across the realms of space,
measuring the days by means of your shining,
observing all that comes to birth.

Gazing beyond the dark, we reach
the supreme Light and attain the Sun,
the God of Gods, the light.

Rigveda 4.57.3

Sweet be the plans for us, sweet be the heavens,
sweet be the waters and the air of the sky!
May the Lord of the Field show us honeylike sweetness.

Yajurveda 19.9

O supreme Lord, you are full of fiery spirit.
Give me fiery spirit.
You are vigor; give me vigor.
You are strength; give me strength.
You are discipline; give me discipline.
You are conquering might; give me conquering might.

>From the Upanishads

You have to be courageous to do sadhana. Only a courageous soul is able to
pursue sadhana.

>From the Rigveda

O Lord, may we ever hear auspicious words with our ears.

Samaveda 446 (?)

Listen to the melodious music of the divine poet.
He plays upon the flute of love -
and the notes soar to heaven and reach the distant stars
and dance on the raging waves of the sea.
The earth, the sea, the sky, the stars are all woven together
by the soft strains of the divine music.
Its vibrations echo through the corridors of time
in the endless canopy of the sky.

Atharvaveda 12.1

Untrammeled in the midst of men, the Earth, adorned with heights and gentle
slopes and plains, bears plants and herbs of various healing powers. May she
spread wide for us and offer us joy!

Rigveda 10.71.4

Certain ones, though seeing, may not see Her,
and other ones, though hearing, may not hear Her.
But to some, the Word reveals herself quite freely,
like a fair-robed bride surrendering to her husband.

Shatapathabrahmana

The cosmic mind was said to be neither existent nor non-existent. Once created,
this mind desired to become manifest. The cosmic mind then created the word.
