If you have access to Usenet, you might post this request on 
soc.culture.indian.gujarati as well.  If you don't I would be glad if you 
wish to attempt to do so for you, and forward responses.  So far I have 
had bad luck with the software my institution provides for dealing with 
transmitting or responding to Usenet, but I think I have it largely 
figured out now, and the challenge would be interesting.

Merry Christmas to all,

Next year is the 700th anniversary of Jnaneshvar's mahasamadhi. Does anybody
know the main date(s) of this  celebration in Alandi or Poona? Thanks and merry
Christmas again to all.
