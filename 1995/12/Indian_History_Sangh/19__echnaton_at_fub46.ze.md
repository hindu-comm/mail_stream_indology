Good morning,
It's more than quite right what Dr.Tritsch wrote.But what  - if one may
allow writing this in this list - kind of guy is Ms.Rosser?This sounds to
me as if one fascist party got the votes of heaps of silly,brainless
people,they are not longer to be banned but rewarded for being fascists.
NOT HAVING HAD ANY KIND OF FASCISM IN YOUR COUNTRY MISS ROSSER?
In Germany we had enough of that and unfortunately we still have enough.
Wake up Miss.
Yours
Ulrich
