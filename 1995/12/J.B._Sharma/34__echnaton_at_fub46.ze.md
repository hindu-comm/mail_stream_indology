Grretings for all of you,
Is it really Fundamentalism which is called so or shouldn't it get another
name for?
And isn't it slavery what is practiced in India when forcing children to
work for nothing?
Don't ask for what Christian Democratics have done after the Second World
War Mr.Sharma.
And what makes you telling us that you are not interested in what Party is
to win,even if it is a fascistic one,only if there is a democratic election
of them?I never heard of an election down there in the Asian Region which
is held as a real democratic one.
