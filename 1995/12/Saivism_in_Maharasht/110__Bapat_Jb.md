Dear Friends
In connection with my work on Siva temple priests in Maharashtra, I 
am interested in studying the spread of Saivism in Maharashtra from 
Ancient times to this date and I would be grateful if people could 
provide me with book and journal references. Thank you very much in 
advance. Please include Karnataka as well.
Jayant Bapat
