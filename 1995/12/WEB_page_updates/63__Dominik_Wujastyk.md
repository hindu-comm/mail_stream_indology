Yesterday I did some updating to our INDOLOGY Web page,

        http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology.html

I have added links to the Institute of Asian Studies, Leiden, to the
Institute for Indology and Tamil Studies, Koeln, to some antiquarian
booksellers, and perhaps most important of all, a link to the Tuebingen
University Library Online Public Access Catalogue.  Tuebingen's library,
as you may know, holds Germany's prime Indological collection.
