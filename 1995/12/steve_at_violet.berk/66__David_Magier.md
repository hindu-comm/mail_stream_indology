BERKELEY URDU LANGUAGE PROGRAM IN PAKISTAN 1996-1997

Background
The 24th Berkeley Urdu Language Program in Pakistan will provide 30 weeks
of Urdu instruction in two 15-week terms, with winter and spring breaks,
>From September, 1996 through May, 1997.  Particularly well-qualified
persons unable to spend the entire academic year may apply for one term.
Independent scholars and faculty members who wish to improve their
knowledge of Urdu in conjunction with ongoing or planned research are
encouraged to apply.  This is strictly a language program.

Eligibility
Applicants must be citizens or permanent residents of the United States.

     Plan A:  Before beginning the program, applicants must have
completed at least two years of Urdu and/or Hindi, or the equivalent, and
should have a good knowledge of the Urdu script.  Students having completed
one year of Urdu and/or Hindi by June 1996 are eligible to apply if they
intend to take an intensive second-year summer Urdu/Hindi course at the
University of Washington, Seattle, or at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison during the summer of 1996.

     Plan B:  Urdu language instruction will be offered to a  limited
number of U.S. scholars conducting research in Pakistan.  We can
accommodate all levels of ability; private tuition may be secured on a
contingency basis.  We encourage American Institute of Pakistan Studies
fellows to use the BULPIP facilities.

Cost
The costs to participants are a $25 application fee and a program fee of
$2,000 for the full academic year, or $1,300 for one term.

     Plan A:  Intensive advanced language students may fund their
participation in one of the following three ways:

USIA/NMERTA funding:  Contingent upon funding by USIA, a number of full
fellowships will be awarded to US citizens.  These will cover round-trip
transportation to Pakistan, a maintenance allowance, and health insurance.
No provision is made for dependents.

FLAS fellowships:  If your home institution is a Title VI National Resource
Center, ask about Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) fellowships.

Private funding.  Students may participate on the program using their own
funds.  Ask us about total costs. You must pay all expenses in the United
States before departing for Pakistan.

     Plan B:  Those interested in language training other than the
advanced program should contact us, giving specifics of the level and
degree of training required.  You must pay all expenses in the United
States, prior to departure for Pakistan.

Deadline
The application deadline is March 1, 1996.  Request applications and
additional information from
