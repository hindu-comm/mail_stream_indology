As far as one can remember, Prof. Witzel's criticism was that O'F's
translation was idiosyncratic and unreliable, not that it was wrong. 

And I'm sure that all the comments about translation being fracture and
reconstitution are perfectly well-known to every serious academic. The
point is that the reconstitution should not be colored by preconceived
ideas of what constitutes the original text.
