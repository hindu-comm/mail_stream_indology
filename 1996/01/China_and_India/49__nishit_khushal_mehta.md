Hi, everyone my name  is Nishit and I am a political science student 
at North Carolina State University. I am currently designing, 
researching, and writing my own paper. The topic I have chosen is the 
relationship between China and India. If anyone has any information 
or knows who does have the information pertaining to the economic and strategic relationship between these 
two countries I would greatly appreciate it if you would drop me a 
line.
                             Thanks,
                              Nishit K. Mehta
