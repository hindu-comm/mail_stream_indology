No, but if we could be kept up to date on any scholarly or celebratory
action with respect to this great Maharashtran poet/saint, it would be
extremely groovey. Thirty years ago I was in Alandi. It was one of the most
beautiful, peaceful spots I had ever seen. Is it still that way?  Or has
overpopulation and commercialization robbed it of its charm?
