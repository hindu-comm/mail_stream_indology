Many Thanks Raja and everyone else,
So far I have recieved 9 responses.
 It's amazing that I didn't realize this years ago, having been to India a
number of times, and even using Kajjal a couple of times.
 Often in contemplation of a collyrium stick I imagined it to be  a light
saber, such as the one Luke Skywalker used to defeat Darth Vader ! 
Any how , Thanks again,
 Just as the Guru removes Ajnaana  with The Jnaana-a`njana shalaakaya  your
responses have " opened" my eyes to a deeper understanding of this sacred
text.
