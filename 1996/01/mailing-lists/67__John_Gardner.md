perhaps review the file that came with the subscription you made ot this 
list serve.  it is possible to have a sort of "whole earth listserv" data 
file sent to you.  mind you, it amounts to over 700 pages of 
mind-blurring lists, but you'll probably find your topic--and many others 
you never even knew you needed--in many forms.  it is roughly alphabetized.
