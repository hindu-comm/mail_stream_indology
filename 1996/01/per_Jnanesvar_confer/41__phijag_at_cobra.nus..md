joint session or parliament of Indian Philosophical Congress, All India
Darshan parishad, Maharashtra Tatvajnana Parishad, World Philosophers Meet,
Afro-Asian Philosophy Conference, etc. I am giving below the exact e'mail

        G=MITPUNE S=MAEERPUNE P=VSNBOM A=VSNB C=IN"

Now you know as much as I do. The above is an exact quote.
