Dear friends ,

This is probably Waskaduwe Subhuti who was personally known to Late
Professor T . W . Rhys - Davids while he was serving in Sri Lanka as a
colonial officer of the British Raj . I recollect seeing a note in a PTS
Journal of the 19th Century referring to Waskaduwe Subhuti but cannot quote
the year offhand . I could locate it and send it along later .
Regards
Bhikkhu Dhammavihari
