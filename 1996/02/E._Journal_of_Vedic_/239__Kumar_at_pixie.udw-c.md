 Dear Michael,

How are you?  Long time since I contacted you.  I want to ask you if you
would give me permission to publish two of your articles the one on
                EARLY SANSKRITIZATION.
               ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE KURU STATE.

and the one on LOOKING FOR THE HEAVENLY CASKET

either in our Journal of the Indological Society of Southern Africa or in
our Departmental Journal called Nidaan. We have two journals and both come
out around Nov-Dec each year.   I am also publishing Enrica Garzili's
article on Kashmir Shaivism.  Could you confirm if you would give me
permission.  Thank you very much.

with kind regards,


Pratap

Amita Sarin asked about chronograms in Hindi works
These are quite common as a way for giving the date of the composition of a 
work.
They follow, I think, the same conventions as are found in Sanskrit and 
Prakrit literature. 
Mostly terms like moon, for one, wing, for two etc. are used. 
There are some fine lists of such words used in chronograms. A good one is 
found in:
Jinabhadrasuri jnana bhandara jaisalamera suci patra dvitiya khanda. Seva 
mandira, Ravati, Jodhpura, 1988.
On the other hand the use of the Katapadya system to give a date for a Hindi 
work is very rare indeed.
