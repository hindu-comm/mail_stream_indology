Dear Dan White ,
In your request for films on Holi festival you say " She wishes to do a
comparative - ritual study of festivals that both have a sacred theme
and involve the character of social chaos ( at least temporarily)"
      Your choice of describing festivals like Holy as a social chaos in part is very stupid.
As you are white as your name is you are bread and brought up on vulgar
racist ideas saying that non- white social  functions are chaos . You should 
watch your words which you use  in public to describe others . Holy and other fuctions of India  are not chaotic.     Yours sincerely    M.Rajagopalan
