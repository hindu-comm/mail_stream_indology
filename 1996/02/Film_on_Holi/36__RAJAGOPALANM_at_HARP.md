dear kumar ,
as i have saidmany times before the word chaos does have negative connotation.
it is just like any bad word used against individuals. as you said , if the father says to
the child yur is room is in chaos it is not complementary to the child .
Since that word does have a negative connotation it is wrog to use
such descriptions for hinduism . again to bring caste relationship
as an important factor in holy description is not correct .it is only
a festival with good meaning . m.rajagopalan
