Again off the top of my head,
"Hafiz" is Arabic for "one who keeps." 
Among other things, it means someone who has memorized the whole Koran.
So it is not impossible for it to have developed also the meaning of 
"reciter," especially a reciter of the Koran. Anyone know for sure?

Hello everyone,
Thank you for the clarification and information about the good times and other
rather sick jokes. Though a Sivasutra reads "jnaanam bandhah" - in this case it
is quite liberating. Thanks again!
