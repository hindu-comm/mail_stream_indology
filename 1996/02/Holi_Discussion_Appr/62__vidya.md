In this connection, I recall my recent visit to the LA Museum of
Contemporary Art. There was an exhibit titled "The Entropic Library"
by Claes Oldenberg. THe accompanying caption talked of "entropy" as
"decay and destruction". I had a good laugh at how people in the art
community were misunderstanding the term entropy.
