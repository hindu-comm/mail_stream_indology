Dear lars martin fosse ,
hiduism is strong and lives to-day in spite of
all attacks on it from outside only because it is based upon strong morals and not chaos.
 die-hard missionaries and intolerant people look only for chaos i hinduism for 
their interest . but it is not true to say that thatis the real nature of hindu
festivals. if you would understand christmas in the light of christian holy principles then kindly try to do the same for other religions too .
