	A brief footnote to responses posted earlier to Dr. Tuerstig's
question (the most recent from Lance Nelson who commended the fine study
by Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega):
	Also note the cautionary remarks by Gerald James Larson in his
book review in Philosophy East and West, v.28 (1978), p.239, about the
need to use care in treating any version of the KS terminology as if it 
unequivocally designated a unitary phenomenon.
