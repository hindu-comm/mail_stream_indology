An Anglo-Indian lady I know maintains that Kipling was of partly Indian 
descent.  Has anyone ever heard this, or any evidence thereof?

This brings up another question.  To my reading, the beginning of his 
_Kim_ is ambiguous on whether Kim's mother is Indian or European.  Has 
anyone written on this or have any opinion on the matter.
