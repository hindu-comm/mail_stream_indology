If US laws are getting so tricky that you can't publish tantric imagery of
a sexually explicit nature in the IJTS, why not publish it from a
Scandinavian server? We're not so hung up as Americans are, and anybody
trying to prosecute people here for showing pictures from Khajuraho would
be laughed out of court.
