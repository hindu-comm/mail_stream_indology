Jim Fitzgerald seems to have provided an excellent answer to the original 
query.  It does appear that van Buitenen missed something.  'Compassion' 
doesn't belong in the list, rather its opposite.  Not having a Sanskrit 
edition of the MBh, I checked Kaliprasanna Sinha's massive Bengali 
translation done with the assistance of numerous pandits.  His list reads:

kaama, krodha, lobha, moha, vidhitsaa [atrpti], *nirdayataa*, asuuyaa, 
maana, shoka, sprhaa, iirs.aa, jugupsaa.
