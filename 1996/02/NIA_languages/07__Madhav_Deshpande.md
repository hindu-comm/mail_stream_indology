	The 13th century Marathi work called Jnaaneshvarii by 
Jnaaneshvara uses the words "marhaaTaa bola" and "deshii" to refer to 
Marathi.  So does the Marathi work titled Vivekasindhu by Mukundaraaja 
dated 1188 A.D.  For further info, see my book: Sociolinguistic Attitudes 
in India, An Historical Reconstruction, Karoma Publishers, Ann Arbor, 
1979, pp. 69ff.
