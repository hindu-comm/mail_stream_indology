The Avadhi premakhyan Mrigavati, by Qutban, written in 1503, refers to its
language as "desi" newly invented from "sastriya" words. The poet describes
the story of Mrigavati and the Prince being culled from a "Hindavi "
source, subsequently translated into "Turki" and then told by himself with
fresh meanings. See the edition by Mataprasad Gupta (Agra, 1968), verses 11
and 426.
