ronograms that commemorated important dates were traditionally composed in
the Islamic world.  The numerical values of the consonants in the sentence
added up to the date of the event.
What is the relnship, if any, between Islamic chronograms and numerical
values of Devanagiri consonants?  Which came first?  Did they develop
independantly?  Are chronograms also composed in Hindi?
Dr. Venkt Raman, would you or anyone else on the forum care to comment?
 Thanks
