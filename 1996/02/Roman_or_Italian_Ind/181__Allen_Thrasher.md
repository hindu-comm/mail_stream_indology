I will be in Italy April 19-26, at first in Rome (at least through the 
23rd), but itinerary not settled after that.  I would appreciate it if 
members of this list living in Italy would identify themselves to me (at 
ATHR at LOC.GOV, not to the list); perhaps we could meet in person.

Also, is there anyone in Italy capable of cataloging Tamil MSS?



Yours,
