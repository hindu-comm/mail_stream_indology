Dear Indology members,

I am flooded with inquiries on the great civilization. Here is a rather long
attachment outlining the state of current knowledge and the work that has to
be done in the Indus Sarasvati Research Centre and by interested scholars
world-wide.
This has to be a cooperative endeavor and will do well with a lot of help and
encouragement from well-wishers and ardent lovers of the traditions and
cultural inheritance from our glorious heritage. Dr. Kalyanaraman.
