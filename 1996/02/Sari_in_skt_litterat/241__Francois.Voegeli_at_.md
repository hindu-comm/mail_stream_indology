        Dear members of the list,
        Here is a question that a friend of mine not on this list asked me
to submit:

        Is there any reference in the sanskrit "mythological" litterature
(I thinks he refers mainly to the Epics, but puranas and, why not, kavya
should be included also) to the sari piece of clothing?

        I can't think of any.
        Thanks in advance.
