Thank you very much for your prompt answer.
In fact I have never been (for the moment) in a well-maintained
ms-collection of the south but I would further like to know if you or
anybody else on the network have witnessed the whole process of making a
south-indian ms, from incising to inking, and if you could describe it more
precisely or if you know any reference on that matter.
As for the "anonymousness" of your message it could be that you sent it
using the mail function of Netscape with which such things sometimes
happen.

Thank you for everything and best regards.

My colleague Dominik Wujastyk recently posted a query for me regarding the 
identification of a 19th century Pali scholar and monk: with the help of  
Indology members this figure was identified as Waskaduwe Subhuti.  My thanks 
to those who got in touch with me.

The letter by Subhuti which raised the issue is one of a small group of 
letters (varying in author, date and subject) generated in 19th-century 
Ceylon, which are now in the catalogue of the Wellcome Institute Western 
Manuscripts Department as MS 7140.
