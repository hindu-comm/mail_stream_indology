Dear Colleagues:

Can anyone tell me where I might be able to place students in a summer
intensive Sanskrit program?  I have three definites, possibly five, who are
desperate for Sanskrit.

Thanks,

Tony

In Anantadasa's Bhaktiratnavali of c. AD 1600 the author uses the term 
Prakrit to refer to the language he uses. Yet this work is now referred to 
as a Hindi work.  
There is also a manuscript in this library that refers in its text to its 
language as Sauraseni bhasa, a term I take as referring to a kind of 
Prakrit. But this work is in a sort of Marathi.
There are also countless instances of 'Hindi' works referring to their 
language as simply bhasa.
My question is: do list members know of interesting instances of NIA 
language works referring to the language they are composed/spoken in . 
For instance, does anyone know what is the earliest text that refers to 
itself as being in Brajabhasa?
