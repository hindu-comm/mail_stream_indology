dear members ,
I agree with the title Veda's demise at NY Hinduja ctr . Their activities 
do not seem to be to understand and appreciate the greatness of vedas .
They are making vedas cheap by writing and discussing all kinds of 
neopolical kind of issues and getting attraction ( Such as whose veda is it )
It is time that money is not wasted in the name of scholarly work but
really indulging in cheap and unworthy stuff.
