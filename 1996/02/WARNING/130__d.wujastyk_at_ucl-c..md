You've been had!  The Good Times virus does not exist.  The whole warning about
it, with the recommendation that you tell all your friends, is simply another
kind of "cascade" chain letter.  The only damage is that it uses up network
bandwidth.  This "Good Times" scare crops up every year or so.

Don't tell everyone.  Don't worry.
