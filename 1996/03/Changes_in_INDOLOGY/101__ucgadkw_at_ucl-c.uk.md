Dear Michael,

You mentioned installing a filter to weed out the spammed messages from
INDOLOGY.

You make a good point, but in fact, INDOLOGY is protected already by such
scripts, and a great deal of work is done by the staff at Liverpool, both
manually and with automatic routines, to keep rubbish off our list.  The
existing filter weeds out most of the subscription requests to indology (which
should be sent to listserv), for example.

However, I am told that such scripts, far from being easy to write and install,
are actually hard to write (well) and difficult to maintain.  And they don't
catch everything.  Spammers get cleverer too.

So the solution has to be more radical, I'm afraid.  I'm still thinking hard,
and talking to the technicians about the best way forward.  But don't worry, I
hope not to make INDOLOGY unpleasantly limited.
