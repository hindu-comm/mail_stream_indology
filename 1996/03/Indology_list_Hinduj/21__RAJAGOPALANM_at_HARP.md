Dear Peter Gaffke,
Your recent posting on Hinduja celter dated 5-Mar-1996 is interesting.
I am not aware that there are two camps but from my perspective ( since
I spend my life as a scientist) there in only one camp namely to see
the truth . That is why I posted that message on Khajuraho and the verse that 
I saw on the walls . My intention is also to see that we all learn together
the truth and whenever we see a new a data relevant to an item we post it.
	In fact one of the central themes of Hinduism is " SATYAMEVA
JAYATE" which means the truth will win .
	I hope that I  will not be misunderstood if I post information 
( maybe new) as I come across one pertaining to India and Hindu culture.

Rajagopalan
