Dear Ali,
Why are you so tired of truth and knowledge? You wrote " why must we swing between the rather tiresome poles of humanism. MAN TRIUMPHANT .Why should man be subject of these sculptures" Anti=humanism seems to be a profitable avenue"
Khajuraho stands not for antihumanism but for noblest ideas of man . That is the truth
It is wrong to interpret otherse , for that is not what the
inscriptions there say.   M.Rajagopalanm
