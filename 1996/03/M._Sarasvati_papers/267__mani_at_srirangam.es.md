Dear Lance,

Thank you very much for the papers. I received
them a couple days back. I found them very interesting.

One question: how does your understanding of Madhusudana
Sarasvati's relative placement of bhakti and the
gopika-bhaava vis-a-vis the orthodox jnaana-yoga
of Sankara square up with the interpretation of
traditional advaitic scholars?  By traditional, I
wish to exclude T.M.P. Mahadevan and others who
wrote in English.  How do the orthodox advaita
acharyas view M.S.'s philosophy?
