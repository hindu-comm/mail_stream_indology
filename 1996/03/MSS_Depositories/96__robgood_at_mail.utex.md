Dear Colleagues

Can anyone give me the names of the current directors and the addresses
(including PINs) of the Prajna Pathasala Mandala Collection in Wai,
Maharashtra, the Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute in Jodhpur, and the
Government Oriental Manuscripts Library in Madras?  I am attempting to
acquire photocopies of mss. of Vidyaranya's Jivanmuktiviveka archived at
these locations.
Regards,
