I tend to disagree with the suggestion that it is easier to spot a
circumcised muslim.  I would have thougth it would be easier to spot a
pierced ear than to spot the circumcised spot unless one tears open the
underpant.  In any case, I did not get the impression from the earlier
writer's posting that piercing the ear by Hindus had anything to with
muslims.  The message simply says that "ear rings served practical
purpose."

Cheers
