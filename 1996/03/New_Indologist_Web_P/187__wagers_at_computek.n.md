Dear Indologists,

I have created a new resource page _for the Indologist_.
The web address is:

        http://denton.computek.net/pub/wagers/ousia/Indologist.html

I have tried to make it fast and comprehensive. Please visit the site and
e-mail me your comments, problems, or suggestions.

Regards,

Will

Incidentally, in creating web pages, I have run across a few URLs, all in
England, which come back "Done.", but without loading any data. One
such URL is "http://www.dmu.ac.uk/~pka/guides/jain.html". Would
someone please try it and report to me if the site is working? Thx.
