I do not think that the follwoing information on Lahore is correct:

This must be the *Indian* perception. 


In fact some of my friends, Indian nationals included, have been there 
during the past 20 years, and have found the Skt. MSS collection intact, 
and the Pakistani Library staff very friendly and helpful.

Of course, the staff  had problems with (south) Indian scripts -- but who in 
the north doesn't? (and often vice versa, see Ksemendra's Desopadesa on the 
Bengali student in Kashmir, 900 years ago...). 

Even the PUL catalogue was still on sale..

from LAHORE???>>


Thus, a visit to Lahore is worthwile, given the rich collection there;
much of it was collected by R.A. Sastry. 


Hope this helps all interested in the PUL collection
