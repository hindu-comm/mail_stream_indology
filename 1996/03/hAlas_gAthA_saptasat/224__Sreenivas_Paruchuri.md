Greetings!

Yesterday while reading _telugu vijn~Ana sarwaswamu_ came across a reference
to hAla's _gAthA saptas'ati_ published by Weber (?) in 1811 in Germany. Is
any one aware of this version? If yes, could you please tell me more about
it! I was earlier told that the existing (modern) versions are incomplete
and contain many mistakes. How far is this true?

Regards,
Sreenivas
