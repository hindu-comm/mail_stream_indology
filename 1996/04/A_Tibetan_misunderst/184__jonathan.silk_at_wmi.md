I just came across what seems perhaps to be a strange Tibetan
mis-translation.  I wonder if anyone else has ever seen such a thing.

rnal 'byor ma lags so //  seems (?!) to intended as a rendering of na
yujyate.  Has anyone ever seen this?  (This is from a suutra translation in
the Kanjur, not a "saastra.)

Thanks, Jonathan
