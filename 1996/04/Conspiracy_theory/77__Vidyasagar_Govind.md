Is it really "absolutely" new? I am not sure what you exactly mean.  
Examples of parthenogenesis are to found elsewhere (Saint Jerome himself  
mentioned some non-Christian examples in the passage in question, adversus  
Jovinianum I,42).

Or do you intend to say that Jerome was the first in the Western world who  
took account of the Buddha and his birth? How about the _Acta Archelai_ of  
Hegemonius? This is an early anti-Manichean text (allegedly before 350)  
which was known to Saint Jerome (he cited it in _Liber de viris  
illustribus_). There a certain Terebinthus claims that his name is "Budda"  
and that he was born by a virgin (...talem de se famam pervulgavit ipse  
Terebinthus, dicens omni se sapientia Aegyptiorum repletum et vocari iam  
non Terebinthum, sed Buddam nomine sibique hoc nomen inpositum; ex quadam  
autem virgine natum se esse simulavit et ab angelo in montibus enutritum,  
Acta Archelai 63.2 ed. C.H. Beeson).

I think this passage of Saint Jerome is well known since long and often  
cited. Among the indologists H.H. Wilson cites it in his essay on Buddhism  
(sorry, I have the exact reference not at hand) and, of course, E.  
Windisch in his "Buddha's Geburt" (Leipzig 1908, p. 220 seq.).
