This is news to me :-)

Please note that this ``review'' must be considered as not completely
finished (although I won't finish in the near future, not till I finish
reading kaTha, maitraayani and jaimaniiya, god only knows when).

My main complaint about Smith's work (and several others), is that
there is apparently no attempt to collect all relevant material and
then see how many are confirming instances, how many are irrelevant
and how many are `rejecting' instances. This is especially apropos
as the name of Popper has been mentioned in this thread.
