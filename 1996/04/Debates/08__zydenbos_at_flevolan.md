I'm happy to see that someone else out there is interested in these things,
since I have begun studying this topic myself (particularly the varieties of
debate, and the rules governing them). But I am using Sanskrit materials from
Karnataka; I don't know of any secondary literature, so I too would be
interested if someone knows of any.
