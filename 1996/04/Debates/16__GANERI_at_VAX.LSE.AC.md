Dominik mentioned Bimal Matilal's work on debate in the nyaya literature.
Before he died, he was working on a much larger project, which traced the
development of logic in India from its roots in the debating traditions, and
included much discussion of Nyaya, Buddhist and Jaina debating manuals. 
Heeraman Tiwari and myself have edited the manuscript, and it will be 
published by SUNY Press hopefully very soon, under the title "The Character
of Logic in India".
