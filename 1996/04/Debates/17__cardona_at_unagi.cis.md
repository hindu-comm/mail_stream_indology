It's good to know that this work will be published.  In the discussions
submitted so far, I have not seen any notice of the following work, which
Bimal no doubt will have consulted and mentioned in his own: Esther A.
Solomon, Indian Dialectics, 2 vols, Gujarat Vidya Sabha, Ahmedabad; I:1976,
II:1978.
