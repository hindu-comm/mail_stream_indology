rAhu and ketu not that bad; cf the navagrahastotram.h :-

brahmamurArI tripurAnta kAri bhAnu shashi bhumisuto buddhascha |
guruscha shukra shani rAhu ketava kuruvantu sarve mama suprbhAtam.h ||

(This is from memory and probably contains typos).

Another interesting fact is that during the ketu antara of the rAhu 
mahaadasha, sattoguNa can actually influence a person.
