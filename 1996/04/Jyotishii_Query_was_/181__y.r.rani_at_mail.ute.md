Since the "astronomy/astrology gurus" seem to be enervated, I would like to
ask a jyotishii query:

What is the significance of the of the North and South nodes of the moon?

How much emphasis or importance are they given in the Indian horoscope?

Viewed by western astrology, Rahu is seen as an element of Indic astrology
and symbolizes karma and reincarnation.  Popular western astrology more or
less ignores the nodes.  How important are they  in the Indian system(s).

Thanks,
