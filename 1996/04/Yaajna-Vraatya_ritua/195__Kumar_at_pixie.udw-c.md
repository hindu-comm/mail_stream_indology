Dear Colleagues:

I am looking for recent discussions (if any) on the relationship between
the two ritual traditions (yajna and vrata); their historical backgrounds,
mutual influences; and also how they relate to the Aagama ritual tradition.
If any one has suggestions, I will be most grateful.

Pratap
