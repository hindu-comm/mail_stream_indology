There are also ghosthis arranged some times spontaneously and some times
planned, during the annual celebrations such as "VyAsarAyArAdhane", at some of
the Mutts. The former Kanchi Kamakothi swamiji had conducted several of such
ghosthis. Records of these are probably available. With best regards, Narahari
