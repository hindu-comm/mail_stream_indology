Compare the use of sUtra as discussed in the PaspazA by Patanjali: one can
say vyAkaraNasya sUtram, but 'sUtra' can also refer to the entire
aSTAdhyAyI, so that 'vyAkaraNa' and 'sUtra' do not designate distinct
entities.  See PANini his work and its traditions, vol. I, section 850.
Similarly, kArikA can refer to a set of kArikAs.
