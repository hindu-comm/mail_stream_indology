I have searched the South Asia gopher, as well as other places, and found 
no mention of any university instruction of Oriya.  Does anyone know of 
any university programs that provide formal instruction in this, either in 
the US or in Orissa?  If not, can anyone suggest a book that would 
facilitate an introductory study?

Thank you in advance,
