I have been unable to identify several verses or verse fragments while
preparing an edition of Vidhiviveka, NyAyakaNikA, and supercommentaries
JuSadhvankaraNI and SvaditankaraNI. Some of the subscribers may perhaps
recognize these either from their source of some other citation.

1. prabalarajase vi'svotpattau bhavAya namo namaH

2. dvAveva ninditau loke nirA'sankAti'sankitau

3. This buddhist logician's (Dharmottara's?) verse is probably extant
otherwise only in a Tibetan translation.
