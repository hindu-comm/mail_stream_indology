He has recently acquired that facility
but I am not sure he uses it regularly
(E-mail:  bizot at isp.fr  )

I think it is better to use snailmail or Fax

 François Bizot
 37, rue de Chazelles
 F-75O17 PARIS
 TEL. (33) (1) 43 80 00 61
 FAX  (33) (1) 40 53 89 67

I believe he is currently in Paris
But beware that he spends half of his time
in Vientiane (LAOS) at the EFEO Center
 Ecole Française d'Extrême-Orient
 BP 3248
 Rue Mahosot
 Vientiane
 RDP LAOS

TEL. (856) 21 21 52 52
