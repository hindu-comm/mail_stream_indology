Hi,

>What is however of interest to indology is that some results which we
>would associate with the infinitesimal calculus were known in India around
>1550 at least. The best known case is probably the so-called Gregory's
>series, which is more and more often called nowadays the Madhava-Gregory
>series. 

There was an article in the Indian Academy of Science's journal (Current 
Science) about the contribution of Kerela mathematicians some time back. If any
member wishes to get the exact reference, please mail me privately.

Bye,

Girish Beeharry
