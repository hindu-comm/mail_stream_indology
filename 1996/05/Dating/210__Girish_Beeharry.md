Hi,

This is quite interesting as many of the traditional paNDitas do things like 
that so may be they are as influenced by Yaksha as by Panini. There is 
obviously a difference between westerners and paNDitas in the teaching and 
learning of Sanskrit. This may be a PhD topic... Quick, a student!! :-)

Bye,
