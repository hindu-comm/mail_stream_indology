Dear Indologists, 

I'm currently looking for the following book "Devavaa.niipravezikaa" by 
Goldman and (second name unknown to me).
Could anyone give me full references on this book, which I need to acquire 
ASAP. Please list publisher , ISN number (if available) and possibly a 
bookshop I can order it from, preferably in Europe

Many Thanks ahead,
Leo Facq
