I agree, of course (after all, he was my teacher!) with Madhav on the value
of "folk etymology."  On the other hand, I think he does not mean to propose
that we take, for example, _bhinnakle"sa_, as a helpful etymology of bhik.su. 
This is a standard "explanation" of the term, but does it really deserve more
credit than the historical etymology?  -- Or perhaps I have misunderstood the
point (as so often happens ;-)).
