Is there an equivalent in Sanskrit to TolkAppiyam which says:
ellAccollum poruL kuRittanavE (Tol. Peya.1) "All words are semantic indicators."
Phonetics and semantics do intermingle in fanciful ways as a society finds
the need
for expressing 'enlarged' thoughts? or to absorb  'sermons' from paNDitas?
