I am forwarding the following message from another list:

Subject:   Sanskrit in Chinese?

I am forwarding a message on behalf of a friend of mine which I think
it will be the purview of this distinguished forum:

From: a039320t at bcfreenet.seflin.lib.fl.us ( Emilio Arroyo)
Date:  Tuesday, May 7, 1996 7:04 am
Subject:  Query on translations

I am wondering if anyone knows if classical Hindu texts such as the
Rig Vedas, the Upanishas, and the Baghavadgita have been rendered
into Ancient or even Modern Chinese?  Are there also native Chinese
commenaries on these texts?  Finally, if there are translations or
commentaries, what are they called in Chinese and where can one get
hold of them?

Thank you for the help.
