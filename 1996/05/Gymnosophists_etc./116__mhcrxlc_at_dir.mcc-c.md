Claim 1) is fairly unbelievable. I have doubts as to whether it is present
in the Braahma.nas and have not so far managed to tease out anyone willing
to defend the claim that it is. I suspect that in fact claim 1) is only
plausible in the light of claim 2).

My problem with claim 2) is that I don't think it can be shown. One reads
such claims but most seem to me to be dependent on late evidence from a
time when the notion is widespread anyway.

Should you not give reasons for this claim ?
