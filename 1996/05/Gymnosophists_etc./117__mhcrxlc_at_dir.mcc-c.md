Pheracydes is early sixth century i.e. before Cyrus the Great's conquest of
Lydia and Babylonia. Persian influence is not plausible at this early date.

Also, we have very little reliable evidence as to Persian thought in this
period. A pity, really, because if we did, then it would be a natural
source for some of the ideas found in both Greece and India.
