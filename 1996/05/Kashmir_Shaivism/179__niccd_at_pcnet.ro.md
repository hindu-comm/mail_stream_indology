Dear fellows,

I'm interested in Kashmir Shaivism. I've read some of the works
signed by Abhinavagupta, Kshemaraja, Somananda, Vasugupta in
English/French. I wonder if there is someone who's also interested
in this field, just to talk with.  I'm also interested if there are
somewhere on the Net articles/studies/books concerning Trika.

ThankYou !

Best regards,
Codrin
