1. The revised and enlarged edition of volume I should appear later this
year, though it was supposed to appear in 1995 but was delayed due to
confusion at the editors.  Also soon to appear is a revised and enlarged
edition of PANini, a survey of research, with discussion of work up to
1995.  The remaining volumes of PANini his work and its traditions ... are
in the works, believe it or not.  Volume II grew too voluminous, so that
the next installment should be the volume on kAraka rules.  This should
appear in 1997 or 1998.  In the meantime, students and I have produced a
data base of the ASTAdhyAyI, MahAbhASya, KAzikA, zikSAs, the Rgveda (with
padapATha), and Nirukta.  This has been circulated to some and will be made
available after more editing and addition of cross references.
2. As I said in the first edition of PANini, a survey of research,
Yudhisthira Mimamsaksa's work is doubtless the most exhaustive treatment
available in any language.  However, I think you have to be cautious with
respect to his datings.
3. R. N. Sharma's recent translation is very good.  It should be complete
in the next year or so. Regards, George Cardona
