Marathi from Kannada? I've never heard that one before. Influences and
borrowings from Kannada, certainly; but by all the criteria of
historical/comparative linguistics Marathi is clearly Indo-Aryan, thus
derived from  something very similar to Sanskrit. The only
controversy I know of is about whether Maharashtri Prakrit is in the
direct line from OIA to Marathi.
