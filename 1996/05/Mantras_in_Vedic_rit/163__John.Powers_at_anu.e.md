One of my students is doing a research project on Vedic mantras and the use
of music in early Indian ritual. This is outside of my area of expertise,
and I'd greatly appreciate it if anyone could recommend some good
references on the use of mantras in Vedic ritual, or on the use of music in
early Indian rituals.
