My hunch is that Sanskrit is very similar to later Latin in this regard. Though
I haven't done any proper research in this direction, I sense that different
parts of India had, for instance, different preferences in vocabulary whenever
there was a choice between synonyms, and also for different verb forms and
syntactical constructions. A great deal of research still needs to be done on
this.
