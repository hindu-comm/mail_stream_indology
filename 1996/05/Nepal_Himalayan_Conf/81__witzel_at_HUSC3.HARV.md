Subject: Kalanos the gymnosophist

Arrian gives an account of the self-immolation of Kalanos in Anabasis VII, but a
number of other historians (e.g. Plutarch) also report it, and the story was
well-known. Alexander had met  a group of digambara ascetics in Taxila and was
so impressed he wanted one of them to join his personal entourage. The ascetics
weren't quite so impressed by him, and Kalanos was the only volunteer. Once they
got back to Persia he became progressively more ill, and finally persuaded
Alexander to build a pyre for him.

Of course this still doesn't get us any closer to influences on Plato. Doesn't
Herodotus mention an Indian detachment fighting with the Persian army ( I admit
this is not much of a lead)?
