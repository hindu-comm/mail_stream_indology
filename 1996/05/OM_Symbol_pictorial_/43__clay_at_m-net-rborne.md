Dear Stan Rice,
I have created a stoneware sculpture using the symbol om;
it measures about 42" in diameter and 4' thick. You can see
this work at http://rivendell.org/jim.html and within the same
group of webpages is another sculpture which I call the 'patriot'; it 
toois based upon sanskrit symbols. Enjoy, and I would be 
interested in your comments and other links to similar type work
that you are aware of online.  Best Wishes, jim cuddeback
