There's a free translation/paraphrase with commentary by Swami 
Lakshmanjoo in John Hughes, _Self Relization in Kahsmir Shaivism_ (Albany, 
NY: State U. of New York Press, 1994), chap. 3, "Entrance into the 
Supreme Reality."  There is also a transliteration of the Sanskrit text 
in an appendix.

Agreed that it need not be pejorative. My point was that they are not
etymologies, and they are not necessarily "folk," either. I don't think it's an
accurate appellation.
