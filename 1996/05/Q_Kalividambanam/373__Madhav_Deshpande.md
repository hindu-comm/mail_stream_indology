	Older works of this category include K.semendra's Kalaavilaasa, 
De"sopade"sa, and many of the Anyokti collections which appeared in the 
Kaavyamaalaa Series from Bombay.  Among modern works of this type, you 
may like the Ka.n.takaanjali written by the poet Ka.n.takaarjuna (= 
Professor K.S. Arjunwadkar of Pune).
