I remember leafing through a book that used etymology to make similar
claims about the incas(?) - the author started with "machu" pichu which
is the city of steps (machu in tamil refers to steps) and went through
a whole bunch of words and grammar. I thought this was more wishful thinking
than anything else - but you never know:-) I later came across someone 
claiming that japanese/korean and tamil were related.
