By the way, such tales of the Oriental pre-cursors of European achievement
are ubiquitous in other countries, not just India.  There is a lovely
middle-eastern story that I have heard from Beirut about a late 15th
century arab child-poet called Sheikh Zubeir.  The young Zubeir composed a
set of poetic dramas of such piercing beauty that he was kidnapped by some
English traders who brought him up in London and made him forget his
origins, changing his name to Shakespeare.
