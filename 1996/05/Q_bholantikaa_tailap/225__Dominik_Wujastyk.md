In the Kaa"sysapasa.mhitaa, a medical text, there is a list of birds which
includes the names "bholantikaa" and "tailapaayin".  I have an idea that
the latter may be a bat or flying fox, rather than a bird, though I am not
sure.  But I have so far not been able to find either of these bird names
in the dictionaries.

Any suggestions?
