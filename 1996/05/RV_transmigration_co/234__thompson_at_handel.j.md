In my recent posting a line was somehow cut out, I don't know how.  Here it
is, in its full paragraph:

"From RV Atmastutis to Brahman-consciousness to retributive karma to spirit
possession.  Are we promiscuously mixing categories?  Or are these
phenomena somehow related?  While I do not claim that they are all
identical, I do claim that they are significantly related."

If this is the result of something I did, my apologies.
