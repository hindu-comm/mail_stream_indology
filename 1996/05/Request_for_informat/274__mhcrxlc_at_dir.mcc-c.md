This is perhaps not very helpful ! But I doubt that akkosa-niddese at Sp
III 548 refers to the title of a work. It is probably just a reference to
the following sequence of explanations of the words used in the 'akkosa'
which is being commented on. It does not appear to be found elsewhere in
the commentarial literature.
