I am working on porting Wikner's devanagari system to the Mac. I believe I
have ported the preprocessor, but am unable to get the pk files generated
and thereofre cannot test it...

Would anyone have a zip archive of all the pk files in a reasonable range
of mags that they would be willing to email?

I'll go back and hunt through my config files _again in the meantime...

Thanks.
