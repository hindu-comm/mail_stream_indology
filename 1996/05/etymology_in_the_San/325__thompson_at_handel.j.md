etymologies...."

Others have also emphasized the magical aspects of etymologies, in
particular Jan Gonda in his classic study, "The Etymologies in the Ancient
Indian BrAhmaNas" [reprinted in Selected Studies II], as well as T.
Elizarenkova in her recent book, "Language and Style of the Vedic RSis."  I
am curious to know what this "over-emphasis" consists of.
