Often irritated/angered by the USA, that's all.  
Certainly not "utterly terrified."  

This could change if the Americans threaten to 
bomb us with beefburgers, thereby sullying our 
ritual purity.  In that case, we may be forced
to retaliate with cowdung.  Tat tvam asi ("take that!")
as the Three Stooges would say.

Just a clarification...


Raja.
