Re: private email sent to Indology

This type of unfortunate mistake can be prevented
from recurring in the future if the Indology list
maintainers would simply set the Reply-To field of
all Indology mail to the sender instead of the list
as a whole.

Mail inadvertently sent to the list as a whole is
either a nuisance, or, as in this case, extremely
embarrassing to both the sender and the parties
mentioned within the email.  

Will Dominik or Chris (or whoever else is in charge)
please effect this change?
