Xth WORLD SANSKRIT CONFERENCE - 1997 
Bangalore, India
_______________________________________________________________

Dear members of Indology,

While responding to the circulars issued by the organizing committee of the Xth World Sanskrit Conference, it is noticed that some of the scholars interested in attending the conference, are inadvertently replying to the Indology group.  Such replies may be resented by other members of the group while looking into their mail.  

The participants of the conference are, therefore, requested to be cautious and send their replies to the specific e-mail address of the conference (swamiji at giasbg01.vsnl.net.in) and not to the indology list.

Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji
Hon. President
