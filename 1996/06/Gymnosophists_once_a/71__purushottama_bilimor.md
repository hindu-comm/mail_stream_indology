>There has been rather elementary level discussion on the gymnosophists on
>the list. Most students of ancient Greek philosophy and Latin know quite a
>bit about this and it is curious to see indologists (once again) trying to
>re-turn an old wheel. At least one indologist I know of has written two or
>three good articles on the gymnosophists, and his utter silence in the
>exchanges we seen on the list puzzles me. Perhaps Paul Le Valley does not
>susbcribe to the list. Anyway, here is a reference to one of his articles:
>"What did the gymnosophists believe?"
>in Yavanika, Journal of the Indian Society for Greek and Roman Studies, No
>2 , 1992, pp 61-84.

>If anyone is in touch with Paul Le Valley I would like to know his current
>address and e-mail.
