In the MaitrAyaNIya UpaniSad (6.14), the two halves of the year are said 
to be Agneya (related to Agni), and vAruNa (related to VaruNa).  The 
Agneya half is the uttarAyaNa (from winter to summer solstice), and the 
vAruNa half is the dakSiNAyana (from summer to winter solstice).  The 
vAruNa half surely gets its name from the fact that it brings the rains.
