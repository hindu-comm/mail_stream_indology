Dear Dominik,

your note on the mss of the yogasUtras caught my eye.  Did you ever receive
the attachment to my last post to you?  I tried to send [via Eudora] a
brief sample of a Bibliographer list.  If it worked, and if the
Harvard-Kyoto transcription is adequate [and if a set of standard keywords
can be settled upon], perhaps I can venture into the beginnings of a Vedic
bibliography for Indology.
