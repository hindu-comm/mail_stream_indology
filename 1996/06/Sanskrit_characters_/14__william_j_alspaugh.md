Actually, the book Dominik was referring to is probably Typography of
Devanagari, by Bapurao S. Naik, 1st ed., rev. (Bombay: Directorate of
Languages, Govt. of Maharashtra, 1971.  3v.)  The Marathi looks like it may
be a translation.  The English should be widely available.  Bill Alspaugh, U.
of Chicago Library
