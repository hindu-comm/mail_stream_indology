I am releasing on Internet the first edition of my sanskrit-french dictionary.
It consists of 2 postscript files of 1.5Mb each, accessed easily through my
Web page http://pauillac.inria.fr/~huet/SKT/indo.html
It is a small dictionary (~8000 entries) which aims at being a small
indology glossary.
All comments and corrections welcome, of course.
Gerard Huet
