Could someone provide refernces on the following topics?

Is there any work on Indian conceptions of "sovereginty" in the 
eigteenth century (something like Ronald Inden's work on the 
rashtrakutas)?  What would be some of the original sources one 
can consult on this matter?

When does one find the earliest  Indian political critiques of 
the British Empire.  What are the significant ones before 
1850's?

What are good sources on the historical transformation of two 
concepts:  praja (Gandhi uses it frequently in the Gujarati 
edition of Hind Swaraj) and janapada.

many thanks
