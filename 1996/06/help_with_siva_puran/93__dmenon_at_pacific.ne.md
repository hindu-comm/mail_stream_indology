While not directly related to the question, Buddha is not one of the
original 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu. I believe Buddha was included as an
avatar much later because of personal preferences (like Jayadeva in his Gita
Govinda) and/or political reasons following the removal of Buddhism from the
mainstrean of Indian life due to the efforts of Sri Sankaracharya.

The ten avatars of Lord Vishnu is considered to be:

Malsya 
Koorma 
Varaha
Narasimha 
Vamana
Sri Parashurama
Sri Rama
Sri Balarama
Sri Krishna
Kalki
