In my observation, its Hindi is really stilted and artificial and reads
like literally translated English.  My colleague (a native speaker) and 
I had once thought of using it in our language classes, but when we
looked at at it we both agreed that it was almost unreadable and was 
not at all desirable for students to practice on.  But I have not looked
at it for a year or two, so maybe it has improved by now.
