To the fellow who asked about printing Sanskrit documents on 
non-Postscript printers a few weeks ago:

Using UNIX Ghostscript, I've printed Postscript Sanskrit documents on a 
9-pin dot matrix printer.  It isn't particularly pretty-looking, but it's 
generally legible.

do his most common actions; those are indeed the things which will 
tell you the character of a great man."
