        I've used Normyn and Mytymes PostScript fonts for Macintosh for 5
years now and so far as I know there is no bold other than the alt-B key on
the Mac. For bold I substitute larger font sizes. Perhaps if one contacted
Dr. Sally Culter at the Pali Text Society in Oxford, she could confirm or
deny this.
                                        Yours,
                                        Joel Tatelman.
