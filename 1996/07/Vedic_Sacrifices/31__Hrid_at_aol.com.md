Sir,
 Greetings!
 You definitely want to read the books of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami,
especially his highly respected and scholarly presentation of
Srimad-Bhagavatam. There you will find the most authoritative answers and
explanations to these and so many other questions on Vedic culture. 
 You are welcome to converse with us directly, as well.
 Thank you very much.
 Hoping you are well, we remain,
 the staff and assistants of Howard J. Resnick
