As for the suggestion TripiTaka-kanduka- for basketball, it would be wise to 
rethink the use of the first syllable 'tri-' as it is meaningless in the 
context of basketball. So one can either substitute it by 'dvi-' (dvi-piTaka-
kanduka-) what is more realistic, or simply elide it (piTaka-kanduka-).
