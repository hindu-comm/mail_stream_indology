Dear list members,

     Recently I have been told that the oldest buddhist text were
found in India a few months ago. The information was published in 
some Polish newspaper, but as it did not concern any political 
matters, it was very short and, of course, not very informative.
Could anyone help me in finding out something more about the 
discovery?

best regards,
