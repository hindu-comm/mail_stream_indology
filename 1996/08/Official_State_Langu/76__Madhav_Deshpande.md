The list of languages as they appear on Indian money in order should be 
revised as:

Assamese, Bengali, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi,
Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu

Hindi and English appear as frame languages, while other languages appear 
in a listed form.  The list of languages is alphabetically organized.  
There is no separate Rajasthani in the list.
