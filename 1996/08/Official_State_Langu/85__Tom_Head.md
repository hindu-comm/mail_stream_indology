I'm in the process of learning Hindi and Sanskrit; does anyone on this 
list know of a text (preferably fairly inexpensive -- I'm a student) that 
describes, compares, or otherwise explains India's national languages?
(I would be especially interested in one published in India and available 
via mail-order.)  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
