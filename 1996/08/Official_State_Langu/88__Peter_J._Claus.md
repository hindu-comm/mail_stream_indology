Needless to say, perhaps: This is a political distinction between 
language and dialect, not a linguistic one.  And one which causes much 
confusion between scholars and laymen.  It is also responsible for much 
linguistic rivalry and many bitter political disputes in India.  A 
linguistic definition of language would be based in mutual comprehesion.
