The situation may be a bit more politically complex than this implies.
For example, there are tremendous state subsidies for production of
textbooks (which is a very profitable business if you are publishing a
officially required text), but only in the "official" languages. Thus,
someone publishing a school textbook in, say, Marwari, will be unable
to sell copies, and unable to garner the publication subsidies that would
automatically go to the publisher of, say, a recognized Hindi textbook.
