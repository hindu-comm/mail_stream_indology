In Tamil, I have heard the word "aarpaa.t.tam" used to
indicate a lot of noise... created by either a single
person or a group... just checked the online webster 
definition of "din" and it seems to agree well with what 
I know of "arpATTam"...
	a loud noise; esp : a welter of confused or discordant sounds

I don't know if the Tamil use of this word is restricted 
to a certain dialect or otherwise.

-Srini.

ps: Does kolAhala, or other Hindi colloquial terms like hullA
seem synonymous ?
