There is a short work that you might find useful: A Primer in Grantha
Characters by K. Venugopalam of Deccan College, published by James H. Nye,
319 West Swift Street, St. Peter, Minnesota 56082 USA (1983).  The
publisher's address may well have changed since the date of publication,
but you might be able to get a copy from a bookseller in India.  George

If I am right in thinking that  x represents the modified kh in words like
xudaa, xaakii, then it seems we need another letter for the modified g (say g_
for the sake of discussion) in words like kaag_az.   (Or is there perhaps a
tendency to omit this modification?)

Fine! - whatever is best to separate the letters.

It would be very valuable to have a consolidated scheme of typing for all Indian
languages.   As well as the problem of consonants, there is also the question of
how to type the short vowels e, o of Dravidian languages where the long vowels
are the ones in Sanskrit (also Malayalam half short-u).   What about using  e",
o", (and u") for these short vowels (or will some computers have problems)?
