There were two recent discussions about ministers in India and the 
languages listed in the Indian Constitution. The following website 
might be useful in the future for such enquiries. 

http://alfa.nic.in, is a site devoted to the Indian Parliament and 
the Indian Constitution, maintained by the National Informatics Centre. 
There are a few obvious spelling mistakes, but otherwise the site is 
quite useful. There is also a link containing the debates of the 
Indian Constituent Assembly when the Indian Constitution was being written.
