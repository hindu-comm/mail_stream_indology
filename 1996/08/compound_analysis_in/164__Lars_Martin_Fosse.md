Yes, I did, although not explicitly.

This is not a good argument against compound analysis as such. I have worked
with people who typed text for me, some of them analysing compounds very
competently, others not. When I got non-analysed text, I sent it to another
person who was able to analyse the compounds. Using the TZ-format, I never
have any problem recreating a sandhi-text by means of macros, thus getting
the best of two worlds. The compound-analysed text is essential for a number
of analytical tasks performed by computer, e.g. language statistics, word
collocation studies etc.

Read the analysed text into a text editor with a good macro program and
change the text so that it looks the way you want it before you start
copying quotations.

I suspect that our knowledge of Sanskrit is probably always worse than we
think. It is not an easy language. My impression is that for fresh Sanskrit
learners, working with a compound analysed text is quite a relief. I have
utilized some of my analysed texts in class, producing a double set of
texts, one without compound analysis (but romanized), another with compound
analysis (romanized) and of course the same text in devanagari. This saved
time at a stage of study where the students in my opinion should not spend a
lot of time trying to reinvent the wheel. The students were happy and did
quite well at their examinations, where they had to face the texts as they
really are. 

Best regards,

Lars Martin

unusable for inputting "Sanskrit" dramas.

But  with aa as the long vowel, two short vowels could be typed a.a in BO.
