Alas, they are not Indian script. They are only in Latin and
Cyrillic characters at present. They are suitable for
*transliteration* of Indian languages.

They will be on my WWW page, which will probably be at URL above,
but the system supervisor hasn't created it yet, and might change
the location. If so, I'll announce it.
