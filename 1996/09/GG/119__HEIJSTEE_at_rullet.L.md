I'm applying the Generative Grammar, or Transformational Grammar
according to Chomsky 1986 to the classical Sanskrit language.
However, I do not know whether most/few indologist around the
world have some knowledge about this grammar, which is already
taught to students of modern, presumably European, languages.
Do you think it would be a good idea to explain this grammar in one or
two chapters in my forthcoming book before I get to the point
in the next chapter? Or do you think I can skip this sketch and
come to the point immediately? And give a very brief review of the
GG, or TG, in the general Introduction?
By the way, who's interested in the GG in the field of Sanskrit text
research?
