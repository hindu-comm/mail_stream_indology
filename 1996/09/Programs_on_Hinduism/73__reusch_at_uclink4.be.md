A friend doing research in Europe has asked me to compile a list of centers
or programs dedicated to Hinduism in the US. I know of the Depts. of South
Asian Studies in Philadephia, Berkeley, Madison, Austin TX and the
Committee for the Study of Religion at Harvard and the Dept. of Religious
Studies in Santa Barbara as well.
Can the US indologists please help me get this list together?
Thank you so much.

Beatrice
