Hello all of you,
again two interesting books are mentioned, which I would like to have 
in our library. Does anybody know details about that "Handbook for 
Tibetan Studies at the University of Virginia" - is it available 
somehow or only for internal use? Who are the authors/editors? -
And the Tibetan book, was it published in India, or where?
