Please note that this request does not represent the policy of this
discussion list. The main languages of indological scholarship include
French and German, and postings in these or other languages are welcome,
with or without translation.  No disrespect to anyone will be implied by
this.  Posters will need to make their own judgements about what
limitations this might put on their readership.

Postings in classical Sanskrit are *very* welcome. 

Best wishes,
Dominik
