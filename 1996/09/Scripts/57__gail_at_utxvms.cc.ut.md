I agree with Srini in not being too sympathetic to the French cause. As a
matter of fact, both French and English represent imperialism to some of
us on this list. Given that the majority of the world's countries have had
to accept the fact that their own cultures and languages have been
superseded by various European ones -- French, English, Spanish, etc. -- I
dont see why the French cant now accept the fact that their language has
been superseded by English.
