I can think of MANY examples in folktales, ballads and epics in India
where the hero(ine) ingests milk, usually squirted in a continuous stream,
from the breast, usually of his/her mother, and usually this proves the
identity (as son/daughter) of the recipiant (rather than the blessing or
grace indicated in the Bernard example).  But other relationships may also
exist.

As oral tradition, it is difficult to date this material, and European
(esp. Roman Catholic via missionaries) influences are possible. However,
the motif is widespread and well-integrated into the stories in most
cases.
