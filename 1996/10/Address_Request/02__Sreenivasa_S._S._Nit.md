I have a keen interest in the area of Indology (including Sanskritic
studies). 

I have, in the past, come across some works of Prof. Johannes
Bronkhorst (Univ. of Lausanne, Switzerland). Since I am right now in
Switzerland, I have an opportunity to call on him personally.

I would appreciate if someone could provide me his complete address
(including the Telephone and Fax numbers and possibly e-mail address
as well).

Thanks & Regards,
