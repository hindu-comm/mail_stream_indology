As far as I know the so-called "Celts" never wrote anything about their
culture and religious ideas. The only written testimonies we have of them
are a few commercial contracts written mainly with the greek alphabet and a
few "ogams" here and there, the decipherment of which could still be a
matter of debate.
So I would like to know where from these testimonies come.
