     The work has "come down" to us and has been printed.  According to the
_New Catalogus Catalogorum_ (Vol. 6, p. 283), Cakrapaa.ni's
_Prau.dhamanoramaakha.n.dana_ was published as _Pandit Reprints_ 50 (no
date is given); it mentions no other edition, but obviously the work must
have been printed previously in some issue of _The Pandit_.  I hope this
information is of some help to you.

                                    Sincerely,
                                         Lawrence J. McCrea
