What happened to Safdar Hashmi? And can anyone cite the issue of India
Today what had an article about Hussain's mythologicals, sometime in the
last year or so, as I recall?

A macabre thought in response to your query about "who's next":  there's
been alot of talk in the 20th century, much of it glib, about Spirituality
in Modernist Art.  Now let's see (when the going gets tough), if any are
willing to follow through to martrydom.  Hopefully not.
