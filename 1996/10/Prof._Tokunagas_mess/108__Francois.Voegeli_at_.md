The direct URL to Dr Smith's criticism on Prof. Tokunaga's work is the
following:

I have to say I totally agree with Prof. Tokunaga's (whom I send my best
greetings by the way) following statement:

So doing, Dr Smith has has caused a serious breach in the "Netiquette".
I hope this will not impair the availability of the wonderfull work the
Kyoto team is making. And if it does we will all suffer serious drawbacks
in our work but we will know whom to blame...
