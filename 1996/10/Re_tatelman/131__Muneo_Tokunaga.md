Dear Joel Tatelman,

   I feel very happy to see your mail of fair and objective judgment. It is a consolation to me. I have no acrimony to Dr. John Smith himself; I only felt disappointment at his misunderstanding of the purpose of my epic files. 
   I try to find someone who can make the Mac version of the epic files.
