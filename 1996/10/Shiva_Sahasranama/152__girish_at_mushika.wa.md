[Archive link](https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/1996-October/006023.html)

I am interested in authoritative commentaries on the Shiva Sahasranama
from the Mahabharata.  I have heard of one by Niilaka.n.tha.  What
is the time frame of this bhaasyam?  Are any books available with the
original text?  Are there other bhaasyam-s on this subject?

Thanks for any help you can provide.
