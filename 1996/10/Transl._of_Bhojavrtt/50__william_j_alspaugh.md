In reply to Chris Austin, the LC entry for Bhoja's commentary on the
Yogasutra is Bhojaraja, King of Malwa, 11th cent. Rajamartanda.  In OCLC
there are 24 entries for this title, some of which are translations.  The
most widely held seems to be J. Ballantyne's translation published by Susil
Gupta of Calcutta in 1952.  With this info, your ILL librarian should be able
to get it for you.  William Alspaugh, U. of Chicago South Asia Collection
