Dear members,

Among the definitions of 'vinigraha' by Monier Williams,  we find the 
following :
an antithesis which implies that when two propositions are antithetically 
stated peculiar stress is laid on one of them (p.970a).

I hope someone can give me information about the source of this definition 
MW used.
Any suggestion would be much appreciated.

With best wishes
Nozawa Masanobu
