Now that I remember the first half of the verse, it does not involve a pun
on the notation of drum-beats.  However, here is that first half:

	matir eva balaad gariiyasii
	tad-abhaave kari.naam iyam da"saa

	Second half:

	iti gho.sayatiiva .di.n.dima.h
	kari.no hastipakaahata.h kva.nan

	All the best,
			Madhav Deshpande

A likely candidate is a verse which again I remember only partially.  The
second half of this verse is as follows:

	iti gho.sayatiiva .di.n.dima.h
	kari.no hastipakaahata.h kva.nan

I again need to invoke Ashok's assistance.
	All the best,
				Madhav Deshpande
