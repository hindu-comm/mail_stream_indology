The December '96 issue of National Geographic includes a half-page article on
African termites whose mounds in Nigeria have guided gold-digging geologists.
It refers to "tales that ancient African civilizations used mounds to locate
gold deposits."  The accompanying cartoon thanks the termite miners "for not
chewing on beams." A far-reaching tale it seems!
