Dear Lars Martin Fosse,

lf> As a matter of fact, I am not a Hindi scholar but a Sanskritist.

Eh... yes. So my meanness got the better of me there, and I do owe you a
sincere apology.

But if that is the only factual error in my argumentation, then I think
I was doing okay, eh? :-)

Robert Zydenbos
