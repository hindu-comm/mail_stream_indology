Would someone with a copy of the PTS Jaataka text do me a quick favor?  On
page 96 of volume II appears the word muddikaapaanam, according to Laufer's
reference in a study of wine etc.  Would someone be so kind as to look up the
*line number* of the reference for me?  Thank you!

Appreciatively,

Jonathan Silk
