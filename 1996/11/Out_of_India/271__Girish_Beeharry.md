Hi,

I gather from the above that some kind of principal component analysis has been
done on the skulls and teeth of some fossils. Could anyone please tell us what
went into the analysis exactly (what are the axes)?

Also, I would be grateful if the mechanisms of 'cluster analysis and tree 
diagrams' were explained in everyday language, please. I think the courses in
Indology don't include statistical techniques yet! :-)

Then only can the above assertion be examined.

Thanks beforehand for your suggestions.

Bye,

Girish Beeharry
