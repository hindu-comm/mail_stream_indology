Have heard that India Office Library has several Tamil booklets,
small pamplets etc., British library published a Second Supplementary Catalog 
of Tamil books only upto 1960(?) in 1981. 

Is there an updated catalog covering old British Museum & IOL collections
either online or in print? 

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
