Ye olde Victorian prude, Monier-Williams himself, lists maat.rgaamin, 
"going to a mother, one who has committed incest with his mother," citing 
an unnamed Paa~ncaraatra text. Now this might not have meant what it 
does, say, on the streets of Philadelphia (or even Iowa), and maybe it 
was even clinical or purely descriptive. So it might not have been a 
dirty word then, though it's awfully tempting.
