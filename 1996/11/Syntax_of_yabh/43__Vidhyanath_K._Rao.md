The recent discussion has reminded of a question I had, but never tried
to answer: Datupathas specify `yabh' to be parasmaipada. I vaguely
remember the line from asvamedha banter to be `na me kascana yabhate',
where it was not clear if `me = mama' or `= mahyam'. Does anybody know
the case that `yabh' takes?

Thanks
