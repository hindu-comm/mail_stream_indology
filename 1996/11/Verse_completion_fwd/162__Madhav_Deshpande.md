I am pleased to forward this posting from Ashok Aklujkar.  He has supplied
the first three paadas of the verse which I could not remember.  Thanks
Ashok.

Madhav,

I posted the following to Indology this morning. Witzel's recent posting
makes me think that my message might not have made it to Indology.

whose last line goes like this:  dhik taan dhik taan dhig etaan kathayati

lines, I would be glad to know. <
