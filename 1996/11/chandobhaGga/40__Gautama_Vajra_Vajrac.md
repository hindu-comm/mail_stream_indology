Dear colleagues,
I went to a traditional Sanskrit School where I composed Sanskrit zlokas
almost every single day. I still remember that in the school a violation of
laws of meter was never tolerated.  Therefore it is difficult for me to
believe that Madhav Deshpande's Sanskrit teachers in order to avoid
obscenity altered the word "zaSpam" with "tRNam" in Kalidasa's zloka
"gaGgAprapAtAnta..." The zloka is in the upajAti meter which does not allow
to replace "zaSpam" with "tRNam" at the end of a pAda.  Think about it.
