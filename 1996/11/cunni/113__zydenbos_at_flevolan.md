 JDcc> This is probably the last question regarding the first 10

 JDcc> Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth:

 JDcc> 1] the dedication

 JDcc> To Papa and Mama and the memory of Amma

 JDcc> (this is not for the translation, just to know it) Is Amma
 JDcc> grandmother here?

Or a reference to a South Indian lady (of whom many live in Bombay)? "Amma"
(lit. "mother") is the common polite southern appellation for any woman in the
south.
