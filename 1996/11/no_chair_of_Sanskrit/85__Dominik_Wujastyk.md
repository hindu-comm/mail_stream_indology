No, I don't have any bird's eye view.  From time to time various Indian
organizations send out questionaires to gather this sort of information,
but one never hears any more about it.  It is hard to keep track except by
word of mouth, and by regularly attending conferences.  I can't see any 
centralized register succeeding unless it was properly funded and kept up
to date on a monthly basis.

Best wishes,
Dominik
