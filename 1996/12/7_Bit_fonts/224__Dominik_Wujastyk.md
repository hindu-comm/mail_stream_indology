There was no fault with INDOLOGY's listserv; what was distributed is what
you sent.  I am surprised you risked sending the message a second time,
after the comments you received. 

Given the point you were making, it seems ironic that the header of your
email contained the following line:

        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

This is the reason why 7bit encodings are -- regrettably -- still
important.

Best wishes,

Dominik
