It seems I must have used my new mail software  
correctly after all and my message went to Das 
Menon personally, as intended (and not to the
list, as feared).

Now I feel both more and less foolish at the same
time.

I am also both sorry to have troubled any who 
may have gone hunting for "bottled bears," and
quite relieved that "there were no bears there"--
even though the message itself was innocuous.

Sincerely,

J. Kingston Cowart
San Diego, California
