Interesting. If I remember correctly (I read it about 30 years ago) Huston
Smith in "Religions of Man" gives something very similar as a _Taoist_
parable. A folkloric universal? Something that got into China from India
back in the good old days when everyone in the world learned the art of
storytelling from India?

we hear them speaking about God's deeds of power."
