Query on abortifacients in Kerala
***************************************************************************
From: Londa Schiebinger <lls10 at psu.edu>

I am currently working on the history herbal abortifacients.  One
that  interests me is the "settimandaram" (17th century: "tsjetti-
mandaru") known in Malabar.  Can a speaker of Malayalam kindly provide me
with a literal translation of this term?  It is something "peacock."
Thank you.

        Also, if there are any books or articles on anti-fertility
(or fertility) agents used in any part of India in the 17th or 18th
centuries, I  would be most grateful to know about them.  Thank you.
