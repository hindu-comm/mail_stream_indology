Heard yesterday in a radio interview with a scientist on Jan Mayen
Island: "Theory is when you understand everything but nothing works.
Practice is when everything works, but you don't understand why. In
this research station, we combine theory with practice: nothing
works, and we don't understand why."

Now there's a common language that we can all speak!  :-)
