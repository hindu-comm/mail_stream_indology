I consider myself to be a sceptic rather than an `indigenous aryan'
theorist. So I guess I should not be answering this. But, as I pointed out
just a few days back:
Intervocalic retroflexes are lost in some Central Dravidian languages.
Most Central Dravidian and NorthDravidian languages merge n/_n and .n.

Also, Assamese has lost retroflexes.

Generally speaking, if IE migrated out of India (or Indo-Iranian 
borderlands), European languages would show substratum influences, to
which we can attribute the common features of European IE languages.
Surely, European scholars are not averse in principle to
substratum influence in their own languages.

be earlier than 1800 BCE. Once you modify `Indigenous Aryan' theory
in this manner, the rest of Thomson's arguments can be countered 
by arguing that Dravidians migrated from near the Vindhyas to further
north during the third millenium BCE.
