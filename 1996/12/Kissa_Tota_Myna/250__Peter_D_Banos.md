_Her_ address is fp7 at columbia.edu.

(Rule of thumb, for non-Anglophones: In English, men bearing the given
name of the Saint of Assisi use the spelling "Francis," and women
"Frances.")
(Also, women are more likely to call themeselves and be called 
"Fran," but this rule is _much_ less reliable...)

"For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the
people; but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen
upon thee. And the gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
brightness of thy rising."
