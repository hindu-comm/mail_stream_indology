Recently in Issue #2, Vol #1 of Samhita (also at the International
Conference on Indus Saraswati Civilization Atlanta), Sri Rayalu was
questioning whether it is actually Sanskrit that is the language of the
Vedas! He cites examples based on Words, Sentences, Thought and AKshara
Variations to argue that at the least Vedas cannot be intrepreted on the
basis of Sanskrit meanings.
