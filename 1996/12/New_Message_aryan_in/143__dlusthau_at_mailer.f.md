Chinese speakers make up the speed by eliminating things like definite and 
indefinite articles. inflections, tenses, etc. For example, "No ticket, no 
take" is a lot faster than "If you don't have a receipt, you can't pick up 
the clothes" (NB: In Chinese "ticket" would also be one syllable). Chinese 
uses fewer words, and each word is monosyllabic -- that equals faster 
speaking time; we start to catch up while their gesturing, but they still 
have the edge.

If you are looking for a quantifiable way of comparing language efficiency, 
just compare translations back and forth -- if one language uses 
substantially fewer words to express the same idea, then it is more 
efficient. I think Chinese would win in most instances, the big exception 
probably being modern technological vocabulary which can get a bit long 
winded in Chinese.

In any case, both languages "work", so the point may be that each is 
sufficiently efficient to act as a language -- Chinese is not crippled by 
rampant homonyms and English is not crippled by its grammatical padding 
(which is still sparse by most Indo-European standards; no gender, e.g.).
