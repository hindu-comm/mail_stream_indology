Now I know the orgins of Singlish (Singapore English)! In Singapore you have
to speak like "no ticket, no take" to make yourslef understood in shops.

If you ever happen to be in S'pore and orders a can of beer (assuming that
is a drink you consume), don't be surprised if the bartender answers "Beer
can, bottle can, can cannot!!". What he meant is that he can give you beer,
he can give you bear in a bottle, but he cannot give you a can of beer!
