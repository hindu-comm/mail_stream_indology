It should be added that there are several algorithms for cluster analysis
that yield somewhat different results. It would be foolhardy simply to
produce a cluster analysis and accept the result as authoritative, several
attempts with different sets of criteria and different algorithms would have
to be done.

This has been attempted by Walter Wuest, but the result is not quite as
eye-opening as one would wish. Since I wrote my thesis on the use of
statistics in Indology, I second the opinion that such methods are valuable,
but they are fraught with a large number of theoretical and practical
difficulties that have to be solved. If anything is to be gained by using
statistical methods in the study of Sanskrit texts, that "anything" will be
gained with a great deal of very hard, painstaking drudgery, not to mention
the problem of communicating the result to one's non-statistical colleagues
afterwards!

Best regards,
