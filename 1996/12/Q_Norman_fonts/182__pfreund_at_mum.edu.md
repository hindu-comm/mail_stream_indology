VedicFontFoundry makes a True Type version of "VedicFont" for Windows 3.1
and Windows 95.  There is also a transliteration font that is packaged with
it.  The VedicFont character set includes a broad range of conjunct
consonants, and special characters useful in typesetting the four Vedas.

Or e-mail me for further details.

If you have a Mac TrueType or Type One devanagari font that you prefer,
VedicFontFoundry can also make a Windows compatible version of that, if the
creator of your font agrees to it.
