Can anyone help me with the original verses in Ramayana where Lord Rama
meets Rishi Valmiki and asks him where He should reside. The rishi gives a
beautiful reply by saying: "You ask me where you should live? With no little
hesitation I ask you, can you tell me a place which is not full of your
presence?"

Further on, Rishi Valmiki tells Lord Rama: "You should live in the hearts of
those who seek no other reward for their good actions.....etc."

Thanks & Regards...Das
