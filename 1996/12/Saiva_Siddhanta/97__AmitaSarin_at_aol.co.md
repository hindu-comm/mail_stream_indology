The multivolume Sunyasampadane, by S.C. Nandimath, L.M.A. Menezes and R.C.
Hiremath (Dharwar: Karnatak University, 1965) contains Virasaiva vacanas in
original script as well as transliteration and translation in English.

A more general work (probably too basic for your needs) is S.C. Nandimath.  A
Handbook of Virasaivism (Dharwar, 1942).

Hope this helps.  Regards
