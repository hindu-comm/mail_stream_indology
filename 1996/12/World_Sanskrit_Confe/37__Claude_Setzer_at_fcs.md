For those who missed, the new Unicode standard has recently been published by
Addison Wesley (over a year after it was scheduled) and the cost is only about
US$50. It contains standards for every language, plus a CDROM with some
softwaer in pc, MAC, and UNIX platforms. It idoesnot seem to be significantly
harder to use this standard than some other one.
