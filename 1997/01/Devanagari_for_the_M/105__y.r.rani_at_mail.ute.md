For  retroflexes such as "D or Rh," and also for Urdu letters which require
a dot, such as k or j, all you have to do in Jaipur is to hold down the
shift and the option key at the same time, and type the backslash / key.
Then, type the desired retroflex consonant, and a dot should automatically
appear under it.  I does on my keyboard, at any rate.

I do, however, think that Jaipur is old and ugly and there are other much
more aesthetically pleasing fonts.
