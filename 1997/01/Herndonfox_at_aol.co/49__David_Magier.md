Can anyone help Catherine Fox contact any scholars who are specializing
in the Andamans? I've already sent her a general bibliography...
Thanks.  David Magier

Subject: Andamans

I am researching a book chapter on India's Andaman Islands for National
Geographic, trying to verify a variety of facts.  Alas, I did not come up
with any contacts on the Columbia list -- do you know of anyone?
Anthropology, history of the penal colony, flora and fauna?! If anyone occurs
to you, please do reply.  Cheers,
Catherine Fox
