Hello to everybody,
sorry I might appear a little repetitive: I repeat my query for 
BELVALKARs *Translation* of Kavyadarsha (paricchedas 1 & 2). Can anybody 
help me?
I am in great need of that booklet (it has vanished from the library 
where I used it) for the completion of my habilitation thesis.
Thanks,    ULRIKE
