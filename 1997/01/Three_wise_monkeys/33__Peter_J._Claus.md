The folklorist, Wolfgang Mieder, has a long and interesting essay on this
motif in his book Tradition and Innovation in Folklore (or something like
that). As I remember, he traces it from India (but I'm not certain of
this) but definitely from China and Japan and its popularity in America
from WW2 returning occupation forces.
