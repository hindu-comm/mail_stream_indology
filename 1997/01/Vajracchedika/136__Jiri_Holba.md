Dear List Members:

1) Who can recommend me good books or articles to Vajracchedika
(Diamond-cutter sutra)? I am preparing a translation of this sutra with  a
commentary for publishing. 

2) Which sanskrit  text  of Vajracchedika is the best and standart now?
Conze`s edition (Roma 1957) has  mistakes (cf. G.  Schopen  "Studies in the
Literature of the Great Vehicle", p. 96-97).

Thanks for your help!
