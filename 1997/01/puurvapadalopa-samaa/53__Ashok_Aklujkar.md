While I am thinking about compounds that could possibly be explained as 
instances of puurva-pada-lopa, I wish to mention one other possibility of 
interpreting ratanasaasane. One quite common meaning of ratna/ratana is 
'the best of a kind' (jaatau jaatau yad utk.r.s.ta.m tad ratnam ity 
abhidhiiyate; I think Malli-naatha cites this in one of his 
commentaries). So ratanasaasana can be the equivalent of saasana-ratana 
'the best of teachings.'
