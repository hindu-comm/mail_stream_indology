Weeeeellllll, I don't like to predict the future for myself, much less for
others, but.....  My teacher Luis Gomez long ago prepared, and reprepared,
and revised and rerevised (you get the picture) English annotated
translations of the 3 Bhavanakramas, plus some other shorter works of
Kamalashila.  When they will appear in print ... perhaps only Kamalashila
himself, resting in the vast shunyata, knows.
