Hello to everybody,

a friend of mine is searching for bibliographical data on publications 
(if possible in English or German translations) about "Geometry"  and 
"Mysticism of Numerals".

I myself thought at once about handbooks of architecture ("Mayamata", 
"Agamas" etc.)

Moreover, are there any texts in "lyrical" form about these topics?

Best wishes  ULRIKE
