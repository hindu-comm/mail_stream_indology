Maybe being South Asianists we could adopt the S.Asian custom of writing
"Dr. Mrs." or "Dr. (Mrs.)" (or Miss if appropriate).

As as Indo-Germanists the German (and generally Continental?) custom of
using "Frau Doctor," or for that matter "Herr Doctor."

Query: I gather that in many Continental languages a woman will be called
Frau, Signora, Madame or the like after she reaches a certain maturity,
irrespective of whether she is married.  Can one be Fraeulein Doctor, or
does the doctorate confer the requisite degree of maturity without regard
for chronological age?

To be unsexist, should there be a difference in the terms of address for
men depending on their marital state?  In Gaelic, Irish English, and
Hungarian, I am told, one is called a "boy" until one is married
regardless of age.  Is this true in other languages?  Are there languages
where the honorifics by which a man is addressed change with his marriage,
as well as the common nouns which refer to him?
