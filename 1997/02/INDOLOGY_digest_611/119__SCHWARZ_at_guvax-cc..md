Consciousness._ 3 vols. CSSSC Occasional Papers 108-110. Calcutta: 
Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, 1989. V. sophisticated analysis 
of Indian and European traditions of humor conflicting in 
Bankimchandra's _Kamilakantar Daptar_. A brief version of the argument 
was published in _Journal of Arts and Ideas_ (Delhi), around 1990.
