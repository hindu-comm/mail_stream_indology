In 1994, Prof. Winand Callewaert (Leuven) sent around a flyer offering
for sale a four-volume INDEX OF THE SHREE GURU GRANTH SAHEB (a
"complete computer-produced index..."). Does anyone know if this was
ever indeed published and whether it is still available for purchase? I
do not find any record of a library having acquired or cataloged it on
OCLC or RLIN...

Thanks.
