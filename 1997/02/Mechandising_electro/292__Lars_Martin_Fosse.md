It seems to me that this is really a job for a lawyer. If these texts have
been "stolen", that is downloaded from the net and merchandised without the
consent of the people who actually produced the texts, it would seem to be a
breach of copyright. If, on the other hand, the texts have been
transliterated or computerized specifically for this company, they have done
nothing wrong. Anybody can computerize an ancient text, there is no author
to claim royalties.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
