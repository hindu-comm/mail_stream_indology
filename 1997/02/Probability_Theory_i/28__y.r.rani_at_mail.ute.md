Greetings and Namaste,

I have a query:

Since the use of dice (games of chance) were well known in ancient India
(Mahabharata, etc.) was there developed at that time a theory of
probability?  Is there documented, from that period, a mathematical formula
investigating the laws of probability (such as developed by Pascal in the
17th century)?

Thanks,
