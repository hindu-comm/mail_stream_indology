>>Are there any paper/books regarding elegy
>>literature in Indic languages? What are the         
>>famous laments, mourning songs, elegies
>>in sanskrit, tamil etc.   

Ganesan, I came across these in our library catalog
while looking for something else...  the first title,
intriguingly,  has the word navarasa in it... but I 
guess it is just a facile reference to the 9 songs.

I also remember seeing a section on laments, elegies,
in a book of Tamil nATTuppATalkal (country/folk songs)...
But there are too many of those books in our library 
catalog to list here !
