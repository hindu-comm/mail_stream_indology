In referring to the passage earlier I also wondered about aMsala', but the
etymological connection with a'Msa is not assured. Mayrhofer [EWA I, p.38],
who earlier in KEWA accepted the traditional gloss "stark, kraeftig", now
glosses it as "fett, fettreich", citing an article by Mehendale [in Fs.
Waldschmitt]. Here is a snippet of that article, quoted by Mayrhofer: "and
secondarily... through Brahmanical identification of me'das with me'dha,
[aMsala' =] 'full of sacrificial essence'..."

Mayrhofer himself remains uncertain of the etymology.  But he suggests that
it may still be related to a'Msa be some sort of ellipsis -- "mit [fetten]
Schultern".  Mehendale by the way assumes a form *aMsa = "fat", but
apparently offers no evidence to support this [Mayrhofer does not accept
it].

I still think that "tender, juicy, fatty" beef is what is meant at ZB
3.1.2.21, though I concede that there is room for doubt.

Best wishes,
