Recently I read Agehananda Bharati's _Great Tradition - Little
Traditions_, in which he refers to Vedic passages which prove that
beef was a common foodstuff among the Vedic people. Not being a Veda
specialist myself, I want to ask: has anyone here on the list seen any
such clear, unambiguous passages? (Please give references.)
