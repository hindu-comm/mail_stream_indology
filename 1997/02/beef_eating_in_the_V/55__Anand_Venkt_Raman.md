Yes, many young Brahmins in India today, in fact, use this as an
excuse to eat meat or to rebel against their orthopraxic parents,
i.e. that Vedic Brahmans used to eat meat, and perhaps even beef.
Megasthanes notes, however, that no self-respecting Brahmana would
even touch meat of any kind.  (Strabo XV I think, I can dig out the
exact reference if necessary.)
