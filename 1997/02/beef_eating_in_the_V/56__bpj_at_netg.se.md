This cannot be the whole story. The early sangha ate _anything_ that fell
into their begging-bowls -- even the finger of a leper, it is said --, and
at least one tradition has it that the illness that caused the death of the
Tathagata was caused by His eating of contaminated pork.

"Peace is not simply the absence of war.
It is not a passive state of being.
We must wage peace, as vigilantly as we wage war."
(XIV Dalai Lama)

"A coincidence, as we say in Middle-Earth"
