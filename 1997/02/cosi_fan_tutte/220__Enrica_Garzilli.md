In the MBh women are untrustworthy ONLY as "absolute" women, with no relationship to 
men. As mothers, faithful wives and widows, and obedient daughters they are not, they 
are reliable and deserve the maximum respect. They are Lasksmi at home.

Difference between Svadhrma and Stridharma and the Strisvabhava" [diacr. omitted here] 
in *Annali della Facolta' di Lettere e Filosofia dell'Universita' degli Studi di 
Perugia*, Vol. XXVIII, nuova serie XIV, Sezione Studi Classici, Perugia 1990, pp. 
149-165)

Enrica

p.s. BTW instead of "Cosi' fan tutte" translate with "La donna e' mobile"
