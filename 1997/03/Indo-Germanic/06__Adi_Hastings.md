In Olender's _The Languages of Paradise_ (1992; originally publ. in Fr.,
1989), he has a footnote (47, on page 11), which credits the first use of
"Indo-European" to an anonymous (attributed by Hans Siegert to T. Young) 
review of Adelung's _Mithridates, oder Allgemeine Sprachenkunde_ in _The
Quarterly Review_ 10 (Oct. 1813-Jan. 1814). Note also, footnotes 45 and 46
on the first uses (in Europe) of "Aryan" (attributed to Anquetil-Duperron)
and "Indo-Germanic" (generally attributed to J. von Klaproth (ca. 1823),
but Olender cites a usage in 1810 by C. Malte-Brun).

Not to forget the new critical and annotated edition of Weber's study
on Hinduism which was published under the auspices of the Bayerische
Akademie der Wissenschaften (Bavarian Academy of Sciences) at the end
of the last year (I do not have the references here at home). The
publisher is Mohr/Siebeck in Tuebingen, the chief editor Helwig
Schmidt-Glintzer, the editor-in-charge Karl-Heinz Golzio.

How about Konrad Koerner:
"Observations on the sources, transmission and meaning of
'Indo-European' and related terms in the development of linguistics."
In: Papers from the 3rd International Conference on Historical
Linguistics / Ed. by J. Peter Maher [et al.]. Amsterdam: Benjamins,
1982, p. 153-180 (there seems to be an article in Indogermanische
Forschungen 86 (1981[1982]), p. 1-29 which is of similar contents or
simply the same).
