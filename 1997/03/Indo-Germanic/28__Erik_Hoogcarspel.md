As far as I can remember in Groningen University everybody of the Indology
department used the expression "Indoeuropese talen" and I've no recollection
of having heard someone at Leiden University talking about "Indogermaanse
talen" either. The expression would for a Dutch audience strongly suggest the
exclusion of Anglo-Saxon, Greek and Roman languages.
