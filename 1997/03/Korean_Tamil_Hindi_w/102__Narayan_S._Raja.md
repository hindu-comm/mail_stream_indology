As I understand, these are not complete 
and purely phonetic alphabets...  Or am 
I mistaken?

It is ascribed to emperor Sejong of the
Yi (Choson) dynasty (15th. century).  It
seems to have been a very deliberate,
well-documented process, so the details
are known.  The Koreans even have a "Hangul
day" (i.e., "Alphabet Day") in its honour.
