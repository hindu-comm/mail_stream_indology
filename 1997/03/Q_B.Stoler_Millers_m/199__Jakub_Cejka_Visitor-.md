 Dear members, 

 Barbara Stoler Miller in her edition-cum-translation of Gitagovinda from
 1977 states that the translation has been "established with the aid of a
 complete word index to the work". It is however not a part of the book,
 which the author says is for the sake of "vrksharakshana". SHe also
 mentions that she had recorded songs of the poem in different musical
 verions. Does anyone have a clue whether the wordindex and the recordings
 have survived and where ?

 Thanks, 



Jakub Cejka
