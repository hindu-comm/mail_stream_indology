Jacob Baltuch parenthetically asks --

> Incidentally, is there a way to get (maybe in email :)
> an honest assessment of A. Danielou as an Indologist?

I, for one, would vote for listproc posts on that question (rather 
than backchannel) -- at least to the extent that I'd be interested to 
learn what some experts might have to say on that topic.  His book of 
essays *Rasa* did seem a worthy curiousity (tho haven't looked at it 
in recent years).
