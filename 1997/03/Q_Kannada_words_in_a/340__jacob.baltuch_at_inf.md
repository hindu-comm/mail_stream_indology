I've read in a book by A. Danielou that a Greek papyrus
from the 2nd c. AD was found at Oxyr. which contained
a spoof on Euripides's "Iphigeneia [hi] en Taurois" in
which are found some Kannada words. Does anyone know
anything about this?

Incidentally, is there a way to get (maybe in email :)
an honest assessment of A. Danielou as an Indologist?

Thanks
Jacob
