After my last posting in reply to Dr. Aklujkar's request for information, I
have come across a paper entitled, "A Non-Brahman Tamil S'aiva Mutt: A Field
Study of the Thiruvavaduthurai Adheenam" by Glenn E. Yocum in a book entitled
"Monastic Life in the Christian and Hindu Traditions: A Comparative Study"
edited by Austin B. Creel and Vasudha Narayanan. The notes at the end of the
paper mention a dissertation on the history of the three major mutts by
Kathleen Kopedrayer at McMaster University.

Regards.
