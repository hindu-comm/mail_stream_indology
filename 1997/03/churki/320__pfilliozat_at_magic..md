The hindi curkii or cu.tiyaa probably derives from the sanskrit cuu.daa.
The tuft of hair plays a ritualistic role in Tantric pratices. This is one
of the parts of the body which are concerned with ritualistic actions such
as placing mantras on the body (ritual of sakaliikarana). But in Tantric
texts the sanskrit word "sikhaa is generally used in that sense. In "saiva
tantras the "sikhaa is tuft of hair representing the intermediate space
between the brahmarandhra and the point called dvaada"santa 12 inches
above. See for example Brunner-Lachaux, Soma"sambhupaddhati, Pondicherry
1963, etc.
