There is a consecrated list of six moral enemies of man.That is probably
the source of interpreting ripu and synonyms as referring to "6". The list
is found in the following subhaa.sita
kaama.h krodha"s ca lobha"s ca maano har.so madas tathaa /
ete hi .sa.d vijetavyaa nitya.m sva.m deham aa"sritaa.h //
