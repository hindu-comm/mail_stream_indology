You've also got "shilendra" which is an epithet of Shiva (from which the
name of the Javanese slendro I'm told is derived), although I don't know
what it means. Same etymology I suppose?

Otherwise, since you know where to find all those fonts, do you know by
any chance where I could find a font of the shavian alphabet? (Does it
even have an encoding scheme?) No that's not a trivia question :),
I really like how it looks, looks a bit like malayalam to me,
except for that it's not incredibly useful.

It suddenly got reminded I don't know why, and I thought you were the
right person to answer this question. (If you can't don't lose any
sleep over it :)

Cheers
Jacob

ps: Don't forget to add info for translitteration of shavian to your
    page :)
