I don't know Kannada. But in colloquial Tamil, the past tense is not
expressed using participle like forms. The typical formation would be
``vii.t.tukku ppo_n~e'' and not ``vii.t.tukku po_nav~a n~aa''
[~ preceding a vowel indicates nasalization, and corresponds to a
word-final _n following in formal Tamil.] Participles are used in place
of relative claueses and to put emphasis on the subject, but not, AFAIK,
as the typical means of expressing the past tense.
