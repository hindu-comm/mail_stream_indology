Dear members of the list:

I have learned from a client who is involved in arranging 
funding for it that China's first private university is in 
the planning stages.  Details about the type of schools,
curricula, etc., are not yet available.  Please let me
know if any of you would like to be kept informed as
more information is released.  If this is indeed going to be
the first private university in China, then the history-making
event is matched by the fact that it will be partly funded by 
by external sources.
