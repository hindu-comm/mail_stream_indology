Dear Members of the list,

A student is looking for literature on the influence of English on modern
Hindi, especially on gender attribution to English loan words in Hindi and
on borrowing of verbs from English. Here, in our library, we could only
find works like "Indianization of English". Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks in advance

Peter Wyzlic
