Dear Colleagues,
I am looking for general materials related to India's contribution to the
study of language. So far I have found one book carrying the above-mentioned
title, namely "The Word and the World : India's contribution to ..." by the
late Prof. B. K. Matilal. Is this  book accessible on the net in any
readable form(abstract, or summary, etc., etc.)? I would be extremely
grateful for any other valuable links to relevant websites. 
Thank you in advance
Best regards
