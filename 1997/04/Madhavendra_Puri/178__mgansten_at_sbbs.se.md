But this is exactly where Gaudiyas differ, isn't it? Gaudiyas would not
generally consider someone who wrote Advaita treatises a genuine Vaishnava,
no matter how devout he might seem. Thus, the emphasis seems to be more on
siddhanta than on externals, including the line of sannyasa initiation. I
don't believe any Gaudiya would try to deny the fact that Caitanya had a
formal link to the Sankarite sampradaya -- as indeed did Madhva! It just
doesn't seem as important. (In our post-Gaudiya Math days, things are of
course different, since Siddhanta Saraswati established his own line of
sannyasa with rituals borrowed, I believe, from the Srisampradaya.)
