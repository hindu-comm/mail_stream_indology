This is hardly an indological matter, but since the question got asked,
I may as well add my bizarre grain of salt.
Re  Napoleon the Emperor encouraged the spread of the cult of Napoleon
the Saint, without much permanent success, obviously.

Well, actually, in the Roman Catholic Church nearest to my home, 
Eglise St Germain in Le Chesnay-Rocquencourt (Yvelines, France), there
is a nice stain glass labeled "St Napoleon" and with a striking resemblance
to the Emperor. This church used to be the Chapel of the Palace of Princess
Murat, Napoleon's sister. I know no other instance in France, though.
