  I've noticed that many Sikh names are almost entirely interchangeable
between men and women, the only difference being the Singh or Kaur after
the name.  Interestingly, Inder is a pervasive suffix: Mahinder, Rajinder,
Bhupinder, etc.  A reference to the martial qualities of Indra, the god of
storms, I suppose.  If that is the case, then Punjab is the only place
where this Vedic deity is so regularly refered to in everyday life today!
