1) I just finished working on a manuskript of a dharma text written by
   Somasrikantha Sarman
   It may be around 200 years old. Has anyone come across this person?
   Where did he live and what were his activities?

2) I am looking for information about a library in Kotah, Rajasthan. Who
   has personal ties to that place?

Harry Falk
