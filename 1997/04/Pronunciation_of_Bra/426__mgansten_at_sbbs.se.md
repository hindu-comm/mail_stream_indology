On another list, I noticed this posting:

With the recent discussion among our Sanskrit scholars concerning what
constitutes "correct" Sanskrit, etc, I thought it might be interesting to
hear what pronunciation(s) you all feel would be permissible. Here in
Sweden, I often hear the -h- pronounced more or less like a German Ach-Laut,
which to my ears at least is an abomination (not in itself! -- only in
Sanskrit words). But I suspect some would frown at my own pronunciation as
wellÂ‚ as it tends towards the "bramha" variety so often heard among panditas.

Any comments?
