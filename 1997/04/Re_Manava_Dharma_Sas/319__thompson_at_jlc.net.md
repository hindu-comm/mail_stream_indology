As far as I can tell, www.amazon.com has a lot of books but few of them are
Sanskrit books.  Perhaps the D.K. Agency or some other Indian bookseller
could serve us better.  Europeans might best be served by those stores in
Leiden, or by Harrassowitz, and No. Americans by South Asia Books.

Good luck,
