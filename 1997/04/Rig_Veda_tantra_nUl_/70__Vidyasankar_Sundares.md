In a private email conversation, Prof. Aklujkar suggested to me the term,
"viSva-vyApI-vitAna" - for a similar alliterative effect as in English. 
vitAna (extension) has the connotation of stretching out too. 

Isn't there a language-czar somewhere in an Indian govt. office whose job
is to coin such terms for use in Hindi? I wonder what they have come up
with.
