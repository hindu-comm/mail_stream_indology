	In a private email conversation, Prof. Aklujkar suggested to me 
	the term, "viSva-vyApI-vitAna" - for a similar alliterative effect 
	as in English. vitAna (extension) has the connotation of stretching 
	out too. 

	Isn't there a language-czar somewhere in an Indian govt. office whose 
	job is to coin such terms for use in Hindi? I wonder what they have 
	come up with.

Although this sounds neither alliterative nor fancy,  how about
this Tamil term
