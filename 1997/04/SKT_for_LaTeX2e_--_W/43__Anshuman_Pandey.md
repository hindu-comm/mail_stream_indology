You can get Charles Wikner's Sanskrit for LaTeX2e version 2.0 from the
CTAN archives in the /tex-archive/language/sanskrit directory. A CTAN
site that I know off-hand is: ftp.tex.ac.uk.

Also, I just acquired a GNU C Compiler for IBM/PCs and will have a DOS
executable version of the preprocessor ready in a few days. I'll put the
executable in the .../sanskrit directory under an appropriate directory.
If any one has already done this, then please let me know!
