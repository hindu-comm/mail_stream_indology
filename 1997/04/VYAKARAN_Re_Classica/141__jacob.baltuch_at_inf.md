I don't normally post corrections to my English mistakes but this one
could lead to misunderstading. I wrote:

I meant "I hope this [how I had just paraphrased MW] is correct", and
of course not "I hope it [what MW had said] is correct".

Cheers

ps: and while I'm at it, I wrote

>(In any case if you haven't seen Michael Witzel's post Madhav
>Deshpande had been responding to, just ask me for it in email)

Of course I meant, "the post Madhav Deshpande was responding to".
