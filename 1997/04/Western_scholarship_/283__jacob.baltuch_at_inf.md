I believe the purpose of looking outside IE and Dravidian is simply
to check this wasn't a usual metaphor. This has nothing to do with
looking for any sources. If you want to explain some convergence of
IA and Dravidian as an influence of the one on the other (or vice versa),
it may be wise to make sure the thing in question couldn't have appeared
independently in both.
