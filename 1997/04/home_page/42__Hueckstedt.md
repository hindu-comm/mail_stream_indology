In the meantime, you can get that font, I believe, from CTAN sites. In 
the US, try ftp.cdrom.com. From there you will have to find the 
appropriate subdirectory, probably /languages.  There's also a site 
closer to you, in Japan, but I forget its address. Other CTAN sites are: 

ftp.dante.de
ftp.tex.ac.uk
