For that matter, does the word have anything to do with Sumer?  Often
wondered if there is any connection with Sumer and all the Rajasthani
cities like Jaiselmer, Ajmer etc. on the other side of the Indus from
Mesopotamia.  Apparently the Bhattis who founded Jaiselmer in the 12th c.
had returned after some centuries in the middle east, so the 'mer' may have
come in late with them. How old is the word Sumer anyway and does the
original pronunciation rhyme with modern Ajmer?
