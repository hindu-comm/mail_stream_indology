please do not read my previous message!!! (what, too late???)

grrr. my previous message was supposed to be a private email
to jean fezas. i've had been caught by that "feature" of that
list but never with such embarrassing results.

isn't there a setting so that replying to a message on the
list would mean replying privately to the poster?

embarrassed in brussels
