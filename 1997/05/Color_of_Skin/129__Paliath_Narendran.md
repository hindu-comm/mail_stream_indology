Isn't there a work _vajrasuucii_ attributed to the poet
aSvaghosha?  I recall reading a Malayalam translation of it, by
Prof. E.R.  Sreekrishna Sharma, long ago. If I remember right, it
is also an attack on the `var.na by birth' approach.

Any relation between this and the upanishad? Is aSvaghosha's work a
commentary on the upanishad?

Another question on colours in the Mahabharata: wasn't Draupadi
dark (krshNaa)?
