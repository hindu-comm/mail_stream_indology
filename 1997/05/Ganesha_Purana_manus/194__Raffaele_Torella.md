Dear Greg,
no manuscripts of the Ganesha Purana can be found in the most important
collection of Sharada MSS in Kashmir (Research Department Library,
Srinagar). As regards the MSS in the Raghunath Temple Library, Jammu, they
are (supposed to be) included in the New Catalogus Catalogorum.  There are
no  Ganesha Purana MSS in the Bir Library, Kathmandu, at least according to
the Samkshiptasucipatra.
Trivandrum Library has at least one MS of the Ganesha Purana (No. 19149,
incomplete, 3600 granthas) which  you  are likely not to be aware of, since
it is included in a supplementary list published only few years ago.  It is
a palm-leaf MS in grantha characters, and I shall be not surprised if it
proves to be older than all the MSS you are using.

With warm regards,
Raffaele
