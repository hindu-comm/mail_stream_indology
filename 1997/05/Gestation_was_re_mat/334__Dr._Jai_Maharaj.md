Dear members:

Allow me to point out that ancient scientific ideas are gaining 
their entrance into the modern scientific mindset slowly.  A few
examples are the principle of bloodletting, the use of psyllium husk
and neem.  Another is the use of garlic -- see Sainani, G.S., et al.
"Effect of Dietary Garlic and Onion on Serum Lipid Profile in Jain
Community." Ind. J. Med. Res. (1979) 69:776.  According to Ayurved, 
garlic is generally an anti-vata and anti-kapha agent with several 
other properties.
