It would certainly be useful for you to take a look on the question of
conflict between non-violence ideals and warfare as a political necessity
also from a Buddhist perspective. It is often remarked that Buddhism has a
better record than other religions wrt atrocities committed in the name of
religion, though there are exceptions, like king Mindon Min of Tathon (now
in Burma) who went to war to get hold of a copy of the Tipitaka!

I would be very interested in whatever you can find out on the Jain side of
the question, btw.
