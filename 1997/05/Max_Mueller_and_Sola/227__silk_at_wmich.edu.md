Re Solar mythology, one might see the piece by Richard M. Dorson, "The
Eclipse of Solar Mythology," originally in Journal of American Folklore 68
(1955): 393-416, reprinted several times including in Alan Dundes, The
Study of Folklore (Prentice-Hall, 1965).  Dorson has copious references to
Mueller's (or as he preferred to use as his family name Max Mueller!) solar
mythology, and its excesses.
