According to the SIL database, this language has no known genetic
affiliation. I had thought all the languages of India were readily
classifiable as either Indo-Iranian, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, or
Munda.  Does anyone have more information about Nihali?

NIHALI: 5,000 (1987). Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Buldana, Akola,
East Nimar, Amravati districts; mainly around Temi (Tembi) village in
Nimar District, Jalgaon Subdistrict; 12 hamlets around
Toranmal. Language Isolate.
