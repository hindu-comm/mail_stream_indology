C-DAC of Poona has produced wordprocessor called LEAP with fonts 
for all indian languages. CDROM distributed with PCQUEST October 96 
issue  carried a trial version called LEAP LITE in which there is a 
single font for each language and the facility tosave only a single 
page. The keyboard layout is the same for the same letters in all 
languages. Additional letters charecteristic of individual languages 
are present. You can type a phonetic version in english and get the 
transliterated output in the scritp of that language.I am using it and 
I think that this will be useful to people who are working in Indology.
