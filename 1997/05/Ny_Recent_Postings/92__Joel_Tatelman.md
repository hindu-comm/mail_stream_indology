My apologies to members of the list for inadvertently forwarding messages 
which were originally posted by others. I've been trying to get my E-mail 
programme to quote postings to which I wish to reply. Clearly, I changed 
some settings that I shouldn't have.

Sorry for any confusion.

Regards,

Joel.
