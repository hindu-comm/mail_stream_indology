Is there any particular significance to wearing panchakachum (sp?).
Till recently, thought it was just a way of wearing dhoti (lesser
chance of tripping?).  Somebody mentioned that bramacharis are not 
allowed to wear it at all. Language/varna seems to be major factors 
as well.

Any information or references about this will be highly appreciated.
