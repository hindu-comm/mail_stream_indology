Regarding Catalin Buiu's request for courses dealing with the 
Tantraaloka, it is correct that Alexis Sanderson at Oxford, who 
specializes in 'Saivatantra, has given some lectures on this text. I do 
not know if this is a regular offering.

I don't know Alex's E-mail address, but his postal address is: All Souls 
College, Oxford OX1 4AL, U.K. Tel.: 44-1865-279396. Fax: 44-1865-279299.

Hope this helps.

Regards,

Joel Tatelman.
