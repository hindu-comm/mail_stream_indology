Yes. Almost everything that is said about varNas is an oversimplification.
Those who read only the texts probably do not realize it, and continue to 
think of all brahmins as one homogeneous group. Those who research the

the castes really are. 

Vidyasankar

to be a result of a curse that SankarAcArya is supposed to have laid on
some relatives of his, barring them from Vedic study. Is this correct?
