	Many sanskritists on the list but not an answer (even private).
	I suppose that was a great blasphem to ask Indians about hair's colour!
	I apologize.
	Worst, I was laughing about Vedic hypertechnology and their 'flying
saucers'.
	I apologize.
	I find too much nationalistic messages on the list. I presume too
many Indian peoples are hoping a civil war in Bharat and are using
historical, arheological and linguistical arguments to confort their
ideological arguments.
	I love peace and I hope to be wrong, but Europa's history show well
the terrific role played by ideologists. Remember the nazi scholar (I've
happily forget his name) who said 'Saxon' < 'Isaac's son'!
	I apologize to be sad.
	I apologize to leave.
