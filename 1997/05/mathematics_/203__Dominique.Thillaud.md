	I'm sorry but that's not mathematics, just elementary arithmetic
and the numerology is a pseudo-science without any rapport with mathematics.
	Mathematics in India are represented by many very good scholars, as
RAghavan NarasiMhan from Bombay, laureat of the Fields Medal (the eqivalent
of the Nobel for the mathematicians).
	The combinations of few arithmetical operators with any numbers are
so numerous that we can find easily many 'miraculous' properties.
	Give me any number and in few time I'll proof it is 'sacred', I'll
predict your future and show it is linked to a fundamental physical
constant.
	Else I'll pay you 10 $ for an akvavit to my health!
Friendly,
