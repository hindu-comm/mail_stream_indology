We seem to have an influx of Indological books with more to come
including 19th c. & earlier books with illustrations, etc. on the way. We do
not necessarily plan to catalogue most and put them on our website so
if you are going to be in New York City this summer or Autumn
you may want to visit us "by appointment only please."
