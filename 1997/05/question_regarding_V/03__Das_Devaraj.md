I came across a paper (1990) compiled by CSHN Murthy from Hyderabad,
called "Vedic Aircrafts -- A challenge to NASA scientists".  
The paper states that the Hindi version of Vimanika-prakaranam was 
first published in 1959.  

Personally have not seen that version or the English version (by 
G.R. Josyer), but the paper claims that many alloys, ceramics and 
other "high-tech" stuff are described in Vimanika-prakaranam.  A 
list of 20 alloys was described in that paper.  Further the paper 
claims that a certain Dr. Robert Anderson of St.Jose (San Jose?) 
State University, USA examined an alloy (Tamogarbha).  Anybody 
know whether there is any truth to this?
