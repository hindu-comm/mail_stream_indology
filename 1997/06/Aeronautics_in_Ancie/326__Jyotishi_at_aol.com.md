When certain people cannot defend their point of view, which they seem to
want to do with their egos, they begin spewing ridicule, insults and
defamation.  They are the  enemies of whatever subject they happen to touch
and of whichever group they choose to infect.  But such minor obstacles are
overcome easily in the quest for knowledge.
