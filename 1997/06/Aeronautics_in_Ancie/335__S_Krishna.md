Yeah! Some suffer from colonial hangover, others suffer from an 
alcoholic hangover! T

 This year as Bharat celebrates the 50th anniversary of its 
disentanglement from the foreign savages,and as Hong Kong relieves
--------------------------------------

May I ask you as to what *civilized people* from Bharat are doing in
this *savageland* called America? Why can't people practise what they 
preach? You preach about "jananI janmabhUmischa svargAdapi garIyasi"
but what you practise( by coming here and trying to glue oneself
to America) is "Greencard America deshashcha svargAdapi garIyasi"
:-).

Shubhasya Sheeghram! Let us not waste time in something this auspicious- 
just remove yourself and finding the truth is going to be as easy as 
munching on peanuts.

free from pests and human leeches! Oh sure!!!!
