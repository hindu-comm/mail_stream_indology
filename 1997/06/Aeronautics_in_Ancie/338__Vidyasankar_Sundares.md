Your concern is touching, but the flawed argument does not necessarily
have major consequences. It is well-known that an argument may be
logically invalid, but the inference itself could still be true. Seocndly,
"there are no manuscripts of the work, so *I suspect* it is a fabrication"
is a perfectly valid attitude to take in research. Without such an
attitude, people will waste their time on wild goose chases.
