In the hope that I might be able to squeeze water from a stone, I want to
ask my university to purchase Staal's Agni book and video.  But the on-line
Books in Print says it is out of print.  Is this correct?  How about the
video?  From where could I order it?

Many thanks for the help!

If you do manage to get the book and accompanying audio
tapes for your library,  please tell the library folks
to put a huge "DO NOT THUM" sticker on the audio tapes...
at the U of M, Ann Arbor, the tapes have been rendered
useless by someone at the check-out counter who ran it
thru the machine that sensitizes/desensitizes the labels.
