The same old north vs. south battle, presently in the form
of Sanskrit vs. Tamil contention, is evident in this thread.
The sad part is that each side often relies on the presumably
inaccurate and unreliable interpretations by foreigners for
support.  I am tempted to propose renaming this list "Bharat-list"
or some such for even the word India is a foreign one.
