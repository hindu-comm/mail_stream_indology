According to Donald F. Lach, who gives a list of "words of Asiatic
origin introduced into the European 
Vocabulary (sixteenth century)" (Asia in the making of Europe, vol. II,
A Century of Wonder, book three: The Scholarly Disciplines, Chicago
1977: Univ. o. Chicago Press, p.544ff.), the English word "cash"
appeared in 1621, and is derived from Portuguese/Italian "caixa", first
attested in 1510. Lach gives both the Sanskrit and the Tamil expressions
as bases for derivation. Lach also gives a useful list of reference
works for similar word-lists. 

At any rate, when explaining European vocabulary as deriving from Asian
languages, one always has to go back to the first attested European
usage. Jumping straight from Sanskrit/Tamil to English doesn't really
seem useful if the Sanskrit/Tamil expression entered Europe through a
language other than English.
