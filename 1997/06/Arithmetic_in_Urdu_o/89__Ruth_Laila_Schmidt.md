Dear colleagues,

Has anyone seen children's arithmetic textbooks which have the numerals in
Urdu characters or Devanagari characters? The ones I have seen all use
western numerals even if the text is in Urdu or Hindi.

Also, has anyone seen any arithmetical signs (plus, minus etc.) used in
textbooks which are not the western variety?

Thanks for the information.

Ruth Schmidt
