Dear Avinash Sathaye,

Thank you for the information.

Ruth Schmidt

>My own textbooks thru high school used Devanagari characters (the
>language was Marathi). I imagine, Hindi texts used to be similar!
>Some time in the 70's the textbooks seem to have adopted the roman
>numerals as the norm for all books regardless of the language.
>
>As far as the signs are concerned, I have not seen any other kind
>besides the "western" type. In "classical" books, either there are no
>symbols used, or the symbols used in modern commentaries are the
>usual "western" kind.
