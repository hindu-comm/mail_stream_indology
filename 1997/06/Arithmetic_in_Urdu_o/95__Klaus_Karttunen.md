Well,I have not seen any children's arithmetic textbooks, but still have 
something to contribute. In the 1950s Raghu Vira headed a committee 
developing modern scientific terminology for Hindi and the results were 
published in a series of dictionaries and glossaries. Years ago I saw 
one of them including a number of mathematical (not only arithmetic) 
terms and formulas in Hindi/Devanagari.
