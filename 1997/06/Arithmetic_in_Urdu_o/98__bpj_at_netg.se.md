When learning English in 4-5 grade in Sweden I was taught the same system
as you were taught in India.  When later going to school in Canada I had to
relearn the same system as your niece, and US people use that universally
too AFAIK.

The Swedish language terminology seems to be a mixture: we say (translated
into English) a/b 'a through b' OR 'a divided by b' and a*b 'a times b'.
It seems my stepkids are unfamiliar with the 'through' version, except as
one of my oddities, that is :-)
