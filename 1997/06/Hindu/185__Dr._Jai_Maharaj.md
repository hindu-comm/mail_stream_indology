One observes that the entertainment continues. :)
The above may be summarized as:
1. Something that does not agree with the Persian/Iranian/
  European point of view is a "flight of fancy"
2. Such fancies are regularly found in the 
  Puraan (plural needs no "s").
3. They had no inkling of an idea . . . (but we do!)
4. Therefore the knowledge contained in the Puraan has no value.

If the above were presented as an argument 
in a court of law, one would run the risk of being charged
with mass-murder by provoking uncontrolled laughter!
Dhanyavaad.
