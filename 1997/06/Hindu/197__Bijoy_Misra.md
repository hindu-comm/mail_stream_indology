No, never.  Not to exclude anyone's research interest,
but not to make general remarks from cursory observations
of local conditions of people.  To study why a condition
what it is is one thing, and then to make a value judgment
is another thing.  The latter goes in the realm of politicians,
social reformers or even religious activists. On the
other hand, to understand any simple condition what is would 
consume a life time work.  It's good that we have begun..
