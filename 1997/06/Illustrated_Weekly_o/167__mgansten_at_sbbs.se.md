I know this is a long shot, but I'm trying to get hold of a series of
articles by G.V. Desani, which are supposed to have appeared in _The
Illustrated Weekly of India_ some time in the late 60's or early 70's. Would
anyone out there happen to be a faithful subscriber, or know of a library
where these issues might be available? (The subject of the articles is
Nadi-shastra.)

All tips are most welcome!

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
