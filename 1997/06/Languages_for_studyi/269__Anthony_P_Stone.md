Dear Elisabeth

If you are reading about Indian church history, books about William Carey
are very important.   There is the older biography 'William Carey' by
Pearce Carey, but for an account of the difficulties Carey had with the
home board, based on the documents in London, you need:

Brian Stanley, History of the Baptist Missionary Society, 1992.  

[The name and date are near to this, if not exactly given here.   The book
was written for the bicentenary of the BMS.]

Regards,    Tony
