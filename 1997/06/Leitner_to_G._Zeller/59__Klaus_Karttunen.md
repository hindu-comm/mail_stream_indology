As I suppose this might be interesting to others, too, I send it through 
the list.

Liebe Frau Dr. Zeller,
leider war ich weg in Leiden und konnte darum nicht frueher diese 
Information zu senden. Ich habe keine besonders gute Quellen ueber 
Leitner gefunden, aber jedenfalls scheint es mir, dass ich ein bisschen 
mehr als die andere habe.
Mit besten Gruessen
