When I was last in India (1994-1995), Pandurangi Shastri (Bangalore U. and
Dvaita Vedanta Research Foundation) was working with a Ph.D candidate from
somewhere in the States who was translating Madhvacharyas commentary on
the Rg under his guidance.  Does anyone know who this student is (and
perhaps have a contact address for him)?   Thanks,   Edwin Bryant.
