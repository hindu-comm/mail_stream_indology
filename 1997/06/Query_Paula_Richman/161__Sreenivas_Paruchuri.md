Read a while ago that Prof. Paula Richman was working on a monograph 
on the political use of the _raamaayaNa_ in TamilNadu between 1870s 
and 1970s. Is it out?

Thanks and Regards,
Sreenivas

P.S. I am aware of her chapter: EVR's reading of the raamaayaNa,
     in _Many Ramayanas : the diversity of a narrative tradition in 
     South Asia (ed. Paula Richman)  U of California Press, Berkley, 1991.
