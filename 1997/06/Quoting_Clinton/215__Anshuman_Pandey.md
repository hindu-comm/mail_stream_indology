Boy, you really opened up a can of worms here! Correct me if I am wrong,
but isn't "iyer" indeed a corruption of the word "arya"? And isn't the
root in the name Ireland a cognate of "arya", not to mention the root in
Iran as well. So, in a round-about way, Ireland really would be a 
corruption of "Iyer"land, wouldn't it?
