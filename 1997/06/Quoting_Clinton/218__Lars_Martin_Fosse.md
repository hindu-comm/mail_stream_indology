I hate to say this, but if Iyer is a corruption of aarya, then indeed, there
is a point! I believe that the native form of the name of Ireland, Eire, has
been connected with aarya, but this is debatable as far as I understand. As
for Iran,that is quite correctly a proper phonetic development of airyanam
(varsha).
