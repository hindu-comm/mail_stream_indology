it could be that the mirror ridicules us!
maybe you would like to reconsider you're point of view if i inform you
that those very words are a quote of M.M. Bakhtim. you'll find the quote in
'art and answereability' pp 112 (M.Holquist ed. - Texas U.P. Austin 1990), but
also Sartre in his 'Transcendence de l'ego' gave some reasons to take the
unity of the subject not longer for granted, not to mention the
postmodernists!
