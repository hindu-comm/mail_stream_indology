Dear Klaus,

My arguement for the derivation of the Greek word Kassiteros and the 
English Cassiterite from the Sanskrit Kasthira is based on the 
references to the import of Tin from India by Rome as mentioned in the 
Periplus. According to the Periplus, tin was used for hardening copper. 
The Periplus also mentions Copper as an item of export from India. 

Other examples of metals smelted first in India could be Corundum 
(crystallised aluminium oxide). This word is derived from the Sanskrit 
Kuruvinda. Nowshadder (chloride of ammonium) is another not very 
familiar term which is said to have been derived from the Sanskrit 
Narasara. 

Philostratus of Lemnos, in about 230 A.D. has mentioned a shrine in 
Taxila (Taskhashila) in northwestern India (today in Pakistan). In this 
shrine Philostratus says were hung pictures on copper tablets 
representing the feats of Alexander and Porus (or Paurava - the Indian 
king who resisted Alexander). In the words of Philostratus "The various 
figures were portrayed in a mosaic of orichalcum, silver, gold and 
oxidised copper, but the weapons were in iron. The metals were worked so 
ingeniously into one another that the picture that they formed was 
comparable to that of the best Greek artists."(Periplus of the Erythrean 
Sea P 151).

Simlar references have been made by Ktesias the Knidian who was the 
Greek ambassador at the court of Darius the king of Achamenian Persia.

All said and done smelting technology (and in fact all culture and 
civilization) the world over is a result of give and take.

Regards

Sudheer
