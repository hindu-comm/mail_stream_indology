Couple of years ago, when I subscribed for the first time, this was a list
on CLASSICAL indology.  Could you please post such messeges as "India -
Once Plentiful" at another forum. I know about several others who have
problems with the volume of indology-l postings, so could this remain
concentrated on classical indology (and related matters)?  Or has this
become All-about-India-l  ?   Interestingly, those topics which are least
related to classical indology get the greatest number of replies, it seems
sometimes.
