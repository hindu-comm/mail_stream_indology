Srini: "This suggests that they at least don't have manuscripts of the
Jaiminiya grAmageyagAna and other songbooks."
True! I just found Jacob's words: "traditions which do not use (have 
never used?) writing at all, for example Nambudiri Samavedins." too 
general in case of the Nambudiris, who have important literary 
traditions indeed.
