As far as I am aware the first attempt at comparative mythology was by The
Brothers Grimm in the 1830's -- immediately after the development of Grimm's
law. It is interesting to note that comparative philology and "Universal
Folktale Origins" were one in the same project for many.  There is a
particularly distasteful exposition of this in Louis Renan's gushing "Sur la
Philologie."
