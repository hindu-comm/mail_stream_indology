Yes, of course. The Harappan script is a tantalizing presence. But it does
not speak to us, at least not yet. In any case, perhaps we can agree that
there is a chasm of sorts between IVC and the rest of the history of the
sub-continent?

I at least am convinced that there was little or no contact between early
Vedic Aryans and IVC.

What does the rest of the list think?
