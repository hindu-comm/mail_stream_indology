If I remember correctly, there is a parallell in West Africa to this
situation. Timbuktoo in the Middle Ages had a university famous in the
Islamic world, where the scholars wrote in Arabic, but at the same time
indigenous literature continued to be oral. Evidently, the presence of a
writing system does not mean that everything is written down.
