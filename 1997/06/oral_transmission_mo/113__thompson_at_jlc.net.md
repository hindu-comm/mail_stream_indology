Another well-known and rather obvious point may throw some light on Vedic
"realism" when it comes to the fallibility of memory: Vedic recitation was
always a collective affair. A teacher would sit down with a number of
students and they would work their way through a recitation, correcting
each other when necessary. Occasionally a teacher might even stumble or
hesitate, and a student would step in to bridge the gap in the teacher's
memory.

So recitation as a collective effort would seem to function, among other
things, as a kind of self-correction device, just like the vikRtis, which
shuffle the sequence of a recitation in order to ring the changes on the
sandhi and apparently to prevent the accidental loss of of a pada
["word-isolate"].

That's an interesting story about Capote.
