Subject: re indology

Peter, I had hoped to be able to send out some requests for information over
indology but I can't get any help from them regarding how to do it and the info
I have must be out of date.  

So, could you send a few messages for me and just
ask them to reply to my compuserve address.  I wanted to inquire if there are
e-mail addresses for 
1)  Sangeet Natak Akademi in Delhi
2)  Sangeet Natak Akademi in Hyderbad
3)  Dr. Kapila Vatsyanan, Indira Gandi National Center for the Arts.

Also, I wanted to inquire if anyone on indology was knowledgeable about the
Yaksha and Nagavasi communities of Andhra.

I had a few other questions, too about some words but those can wait?  Can you
send these requests for me or tell me how to send them?  I am a subscriber and
get the daily dose of messages.  I just don't seem to know the right commands to
send to get any answers.
