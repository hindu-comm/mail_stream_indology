Does anyone know what a yojana is worth about
and what the etymology of the word is?

It is a measure of distance used in Ashoka's 13th
rock edict.

It's not an extremely vital piece of information
for me, so please don't go to any great trouble
to look it up, but if you happen to know, I'd be
grateful.
