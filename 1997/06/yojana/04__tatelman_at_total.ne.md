See A.L. Basham, _The Wonder That Was India_ (London: Sidgewick & Jackson,
1967), pp. 503-504 and D.D. Kosambi, _The Culture and Civilization of
Ancient India in Historical Outline_ (Delhi: Vikas Publications, 1970), p.
161.

Basham suggests the yojana used in the A'sokan period was equivalent to 4.5
miles and that in later epochs it was equivalent to 9 miles. From my own
reading this latter figure at least is confirmed by the Dhammapada
Commentary and the Divyaavadaana.

Sorry not to have more up-to-date references.

Hope this helps.

Joel.
