Yes, I think you are right: the opposition is obviously 'dangerous animal'
(vyaala) v. 'not dangerous (or, perhaps, as you say 'ordinary') animal'
(m.rga). vyaala may, in ordinary sanskrit, also mean 'vicious elephant',
'poisonous snake', so 'predator' might just not be the right word.

Best wishes
