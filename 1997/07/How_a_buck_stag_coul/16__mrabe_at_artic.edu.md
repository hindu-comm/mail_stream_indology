Well folks,
        My article on Durga/Korravai as seen in Pallava and Chola sculpture
is now posted, at this URL:

http://www.sxu.edu/faculty/rabe/Durga/Index.htm

I recommend having something else to read along side your computer during
the image downloads, though there's aways text of the article itself coming
in faster...

Enjoy,
Michael Rabe
