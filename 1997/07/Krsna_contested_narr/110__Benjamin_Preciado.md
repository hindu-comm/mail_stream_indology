In reference to Bryant´s query on polemical references to 
Krsna biography, you can look my KRSNA CYCLE IN THE PURANAS 
(Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi 1984) the Jataka mentioned by 
Michael Rabe is discussed there. You don't need to go out of 
Hindu texts to find polemical references to K, see for example 
the version in the Devi Bhagavata Purana.

The above discussion suddenly reminds me too that mention way made of a
Buddhist jataka variant on some facet of Krishna's life.  Checking my HD
memory, this is all I can recover: Jim Hartzell
<jh at cubsps.bio.columbia.edu>, in 1995 a graduate student at Columbia
university, was the source of this information, but I never followed up to
acquire the actual citation.
