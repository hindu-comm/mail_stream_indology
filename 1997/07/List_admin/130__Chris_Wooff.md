This is a standard message which is being sent to some of the busier lists 
we manage. Apologies to those of you who get multiple copies

For the next few weeks, responsibilities for looking after this list will be 
shared by several of us here. Provided you follow the recommended guidelines 
and send list queries to the address XXXX-request (replace XXXX with the 
listname) then your query will be promptly dealt with. If you send queries to a 
specified individual then there may be an appreciable delay.
