A scholar writing a major book on an American leftist revolutionary is
trying to find the address of Nirode K. Barooah, who has written on Indian
revolutionaries in Germany and on Assam history. She is writing him
through several publishers but would naturally like a quicker address.  I
have already checked SARAI/S. Asia Gopher.

Could anyone help?
