While studying this interesting language I realize that I'm spoiled by the
Sanskrit bibliography. I'm looking for the equivalent of Whitney/Macdonell
for Panjabi; does it exist at all?
Also, has anyone done an in-depth study of the Panjabi accent system? And
has anyone compared Panjabi & Vedic accents?
Finally, has anyone done any other comparative analysis of Panjabi & Vedic?
I'd very much appreciate your advice.
With best wishes,
