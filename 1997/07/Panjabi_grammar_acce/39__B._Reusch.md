You are right. They compensate for the loss of voice-aspiration and plain
aspiration. I was asking for more general and historical analyses, assuming
that I must be missing something.
Also, I recall having heard that Panjabi is the only modern Indo-Aryan
language that may have derived from Vedic rather than from Classical Skt.
and would like to have specific sources on that.
Thank you.
