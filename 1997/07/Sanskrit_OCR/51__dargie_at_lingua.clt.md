I think I am safe in assuming that no-one has yet developed an optical
character recognition (OCR) system for the devanagari script.

I know that DHH Ingalls and his son had worked on the problem some 20 years
ago, but I have not heard any more about it.

In any case, does anyone know of an OCR system that is accurate for roman
transliteration.  Has anyone tried to input text in this way?

Regards and thanks in advance,

David Dargie
