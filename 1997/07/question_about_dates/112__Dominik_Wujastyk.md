Not to my knowledge.  But not because they are too precious, but because
they are too young.  No known Sanskrit manuscript dates from before the
Christian era, and one can usually tell the date of a MS to within a
couple of hundred years or so by examining its external appearence and
script (eh, Richard?).  This is much closer than one could get with
radiocarbon dating. 

All the best,
Dominik
