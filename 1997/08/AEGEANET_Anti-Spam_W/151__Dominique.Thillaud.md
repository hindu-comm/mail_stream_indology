Sorry to continue the thread, but here is a solution that has not yet
been suggested.  I urge all Aegeanet members to forward the unsolicited
message (if you still have it) to postmaster at rocketmail.com.  It is
almost universal that these free Email accounts come with the stipulation
that no bulk mailings will be sent out.  If they are aware that this
person sent out this bulk mailing, and enough people complain about it,
they will probably drop her from their service.  Be sure that the full
mail header is included in the forward, this will show that it did come
from their service.
