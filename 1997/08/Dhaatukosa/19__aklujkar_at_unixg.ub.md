You should find G.B. Palsule's two books on the Dhatu-paa.thas, published
by Deccan College, Poona/Pune, useful. They review the earlier work of
Liebich etc. Bhagiiratha Prasaada Tripaa.thii (pen-name Vaagii;sa ;Saastri)
also has a book in Sanskrit dealing with dhaatus. It is published by the
Sampurnananda Sanskrit Univ., Varanasi. Dr. Ch. Werba (Indologisches
Seminar, Wien/Vienna) is working on a considerably improved version of
Whitney's _Roots._  (the project has several other important features too).


A reference to George Cardona's Paa.nini: Survey of Research, if not
already made, should be rewarding.
