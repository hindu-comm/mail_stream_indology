I'm sure John has already thought of this, but there is of course some
mention of these topics in the Bhagavadgita, for instance towards the end of
the fourth chapter:
        'sraddhaavaal labhate jñaana.m tatpara.h sa.myatendriya.h ...
        ajña's caa'sraddadhaana's ca sa.m'sayaatmaa vina'syati
-- etc. Perhaps something useful can be found in the various commentaries to
these passages?
