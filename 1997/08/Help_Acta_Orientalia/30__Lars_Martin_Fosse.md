As far as I know, ALL journals dealing with oriental studies will
necessarily contain the same kind of material. Acta Orientalia is just as
interesting - or uninteresting - as other oriental journals. But it is the
only oriental journal published by the Nordic countries (or rather by
Denmark). Which is why some of us want to keep it.
