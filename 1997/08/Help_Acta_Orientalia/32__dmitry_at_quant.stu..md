        Dear Sir,

      I used to look through several copies of the journal and it's seems to me I know the
reason of today's state of things. The main problem is that the content of this journal is
not interesting: many articles on the same matters are available in other journals. Natural-
ly, nobody wants to get the same information twice.


        Truthly Yours,
                              Tattvarthi. dmitry at quant.stu.neva.ru
