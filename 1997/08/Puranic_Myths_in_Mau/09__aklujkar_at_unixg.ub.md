Checking myths 7-8 in _Hindu Myths_ (Penguin Books) by Wendy Doniger (the
last name is Doniger O'Flaherty on the first edition I have), along with
the related myths mentioned in the annotation (pp. 315-16 in the 1975 edn I
have before me), should be useful.  The possibility that Maun_i's narrative
could be a deliberate take-off on earlier narratives should be borne in
mind.
