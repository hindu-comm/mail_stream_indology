Dumezil was champion of the New Comparative school of IE mythology which
found a tripartite division in Indo-European myths and ideology, i.e., a
first "function" contractual/religious domain, a second function martial
force domain (ksatriya), and a third function pastoral, agricultural
domain. For more on Dumezil's paradigm, consult C. Scott Littleton's The
New Comparative Mythology(Berkeley, and Los Angeles 1982)
I, too, am unfamiliar with his views on polyandry.
