Dear members, I would like to know if there is any
mention in the sUtra literature of usage of Vedic 
vikrtis such as krama, jaTA, ghana, ratha pAThas
in ritual as opposed to adhyayana.

Ghana recitation is heard on some occasions in
Vedic ritual in S.India... does this have any 
basis in the existing textual sources ? 

Thanks,
-Srini.
