I used Teach Yourself Bengali by William Radice to learn the Bengali script.
I only worked through the lessons on the script, but I also learned a bit of
the Bengali language in the process. The book is so well structured that I
wished that I had had the time to continue to learn the language. Teach
Yourself Bengali is available with or without two cassettes. I recommend it
highly.
