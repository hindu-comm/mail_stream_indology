Could anybody please help me locate the following article by Alfred Ludwig?
I have searched in the catalogs available to me here at U.C. Berkeley,
without success. The title is: "Uber die mythische grundlage des
Mahabharata." I believe it was published under Gesellschaft der
Wissenschaften in 1895.

Thank you very much in advance,

Swami Gitananda
