I've experienced this problem before but not with the bombay site. Try
holding down [shift] while you click on the filename. Perhaps your browser
does not recognize the extension .zip. Go into your browser options can
set zip as a valid file extension (zip-application). Best yet is to revert
back to the old FTP software... :-> Can't go wrong with the tried and

Installation is fairly straightforward for TrueType fonts in Windows 95.
Just copy the fonts to the fonts directory and they should be available.
Fot Windows 3.1: open up the Control Panel and choose Add Fonts. Add the
fonts, and they should be available for use.
