I have downloaded this file and did not have any problem in installing it.
You  need some program that can uncompress the zip file such as PKZIP or
Winzip. After you have uncompressed the file you can install the ttf file
normally depending on whether you are using w3.1 or w95.

If you need more help, contact me by email.
