Dear members of the Indology List,

As I was composing my last email, I noticed a flood of email in my box. Among
other useful things, almost all of them related to the subject of the name
Aasanga, who, as we know was cursed by the gods to be a woman. I am just
wondering: should not have I dealt more with the words, terms, names,
aspects, etc.,  relating to woman, rather than having concentrated on such
things related to men? Never mind, even if they were sages! Best regards.

Yours

Keerthi
