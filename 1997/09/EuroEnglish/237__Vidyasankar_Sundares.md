On the whole, Mark Twain's plan is much better conceived, and should be
recommended to her majesty's government! Notice that right at the
beginning, Twain wants to retain c till an adequate replacement can be
found for ch. The author of the new EuroEnglish essay overlooks this, and
uses the word "change" two paragraphs after getting rid of c. Vil ze drem
bikom a nytmar? Long live English spelling. :-)
