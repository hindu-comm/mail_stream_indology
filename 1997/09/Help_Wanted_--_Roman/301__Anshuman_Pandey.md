By "romanised English" do you mean romanisied Devanagari (Devanagari in
Roman script with diacritics)? Your write that you have "translated" this
text using the keyboard. Which program did you use for this task?
Depending upon your input scheme and the format in which the text is
saved, there are a few ways you could produce Devanagari output from what
you currently have.

Depending on what input scheme you used you would probably to convert your
existing transliteration to a different scheme. By doing this you could
set yourself up for running a typesetting program called TeX with one of
three Devanagari packages: Devnag, ITRANS, or Skt.

This seems the most plausible, not to mention efficient, method of
producing Devanagari script output with your text without "using the
keyboard".
