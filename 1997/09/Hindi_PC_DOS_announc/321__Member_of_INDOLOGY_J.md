> New Delhi, September 15, 1997
>  To commemorate the Official Language Day, TATA IBM today announced the
> availability of the Hindi PC DOS in India.  . . .
> In a country where only 5% of the population speaks English, language is
> the biggest barrier to computer literacy. The Tata IBM initiative will
> enable the Hindi speaking population of 360 million to have access to
> computers in their language. . . .
