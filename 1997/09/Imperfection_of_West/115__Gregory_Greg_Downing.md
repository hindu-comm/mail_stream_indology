Ah, but a crucial principle in Dravidian--not to mention
Sumerian--etymological cryptography is (apparently, from the postings) that
the consonants have to be reversed. So "indology" ulteriorly derives from
the consonant-sequence GLDN. Clearly, "indology" comes from "golden," and
was originally a pejorative term (cf. "Protestant") implying that people are
only in it for the money!

(Thanks again to all those on this list who commented on my queries this
past June about late-19C solar religion among Indologists.)
