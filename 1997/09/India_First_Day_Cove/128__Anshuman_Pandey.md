Hello,

Could anyone please tell me if India issues First Day Covers, and if so,
where they may be acquired from. I'm particularly interested in knowing
whether or not India issued an FDC commemorating its 50th year of
independence.

I recall my father having a subscription for Norwegian FDCs when we lived
in Norway, which he continued when we moved to the US. I'm assuming (and
hoping) that India would offer such a programme as well.

Any information is greatly appreciated!!

Thanks.

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
