Greetings,

        I am trying to locate (thus far with little success) scholarly
materials on the topic of contemporary popular Indian religious art (e.g.,
books/articles dealing with calender art, 'God posters', etc.). I am interested
not only in this form of art as used in strictly religious/devotional contexts,
but also its use in Indian commercial/graphic art (e.g., advertisments, product
packaging, etc.). Can anyone out there alert me to some relevent materials?

        Thanks,

        Kristen Hardy,
        student of Religious Studies and Sanskrit
        (University of Manitoba)
