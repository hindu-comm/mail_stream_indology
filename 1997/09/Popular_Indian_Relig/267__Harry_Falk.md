>         I am trying to locate (thus far with little success) scholarly
> materials on the topic of contemporary popular Indian religious art (e.g.,
> books/articles dealing with calender art, 'God posters', etc.). I am interested
> not only in this form of art as used in strictly religious/devotional contexts,
> but also its use in Indian commercial/graphic art (e.g., advertisments, product
> packaging, etc.). Can anyone out there alert me to some relevent materials?

Have a look into David J. Dell: Guide to Hindu Religion. Boston 1981
This is an annotated bibliography on everything you need.
