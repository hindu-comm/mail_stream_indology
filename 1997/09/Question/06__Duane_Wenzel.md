This title is available at the University of Pennsylvania according to my
Sanskrit professor, Walter Maurer, who used it this past year when he was
on sabbatical working on his latest book, which will be selections from
the AV.  However, he said the volumes are very brittle and therefore,
probably not good candidates for interlibrary loan, but you could try.
