Hi,
I am programming VBA modules that search in the TOKUNAGA-Mahabharata files for
certain words you are looking for. The module looks not only for the term you
are looking for but also checks for all possible cases and of cours the cases
of sandhi too have to realzed. At the end the module should give you a list
with all stanzas in your actual Winword-window. Are there anybody doing the
job together with me?
