In fact, it does not provide a full line, but the corersponding pAda. For
every entry the number of ocurrences is provided as well as the list of
pAda locations in which the particular word is found. For repeated pAda-s
only the first occurrence is quoted and the rest are cited. The words are
organized following Grassman's dictionary. with some exceptions. There is
also a two-page list of entries that differ from the Pada-pATha.
