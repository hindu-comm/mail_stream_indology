I am searching for any material eluding the relation between the Yaku-cult of
the Andamans and the YakSa-goddess as presented in the classical literature in
India. Here especially the topic of karNa-Ashrutya-vidyA (magic transmitted by
words only?) is of interest and the power of subduing (shAnti) wild YakSas.
Does anyone knows literature that goes beyond of Hastings ERE?
