I have encountered this word in a children's story (written in Urdu in
Lahore in the 1960's).  From the context, it means 'male sparrow', but I
have not been able to locate it in any Urdu or Hindi dictionary that I
have looked at.  Can anyone tell me the dialect provenance of this word.
(note that r is not retroflex.)  Thanks
