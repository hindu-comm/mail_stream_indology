Periyar is also dead, there are several books about him f.i.
by Anita Diehl, Scandinavian  University Books, Munksgaard Kopenhagen 1977
ISBN 91-24-27645-6

Jack Preger is the founder of the Calcutta Rescue Fund, he's been in jail
several times for giving medical help to the poor in Calcutta, but has found
some recognition at last. I don't know what the address is the Calcutta Rescue
Fund, I'm sorry
