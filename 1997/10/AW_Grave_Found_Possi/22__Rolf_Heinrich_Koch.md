There must probably be a reason why Europeans always translate the
Sanskrittexts. I do not know the reason. Do you?
To get to be a rich man is doubtlessly not the right reason. You agree?

Perhaps because the smilies were deleted.  They are
now restored (see above).  I have run across many
Eurocentrics who refuse to realize that the world
existed before them and that others accomplished
a lot in science before them.  Some of these jokers
even teach in universities, misinforming others.
