Hello Jan,

There is one translation of the AV which comes to mind and that is the
one by Whitney. Here is an abbreviated record:

_Atharva-veda Samhita_
(Translated with a critical and exegetical commentary_
by William Dwight Whitney
Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1962.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
