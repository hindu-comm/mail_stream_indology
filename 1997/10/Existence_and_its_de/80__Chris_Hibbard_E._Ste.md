The definition sadupalambhakapramANagocaratvam for existence seems to
figure as a vaiZeSika definition, according to kamalaZIlaH. See
tattvasaGgrahapaJjikA 14.18-19 (Dwarikadas' edition) -

... dharmivyatirekiNo dharmAH kaiZcidupavarNyante yathA SaNNAmapi
padArthAnAmastitvaM sadupalambhakapramANaviSayatvamityevamAdayaH ....

and tattvasaGgrahapaJjikA 241.12-13 (Dwarikadas' edition) -

anyaH punarAha "SaNNAmastitvaM hi sadupalambhakapramANagamyatvam gamyatvaM

Wilhelm Halbfass refers (*On Being and What There Is*, 159 and notes 120
and 121 thereto) to the section of tattvasaGgrahaH and
tattvasaGgrahapaJjikA in which the second extract occurs, and the
paraphrase/reworking of this in abhayadevasUri's tattvabodhavidhAyinI.
