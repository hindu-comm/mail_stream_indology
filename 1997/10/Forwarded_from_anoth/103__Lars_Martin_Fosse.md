Hi,

I would very much appreciate information on software to transcribe
Sanskrit text into English, for corpus-related work. Specifically,
I am looking for some software to do optical character recognition
of Sanskrit (an Indo-Aryan language) text, and perform a transcription
from the Sanskrit orthography into the Roman script (English).

Responses by email (to rjprasad at BABEL.ling.upenn.edu )
would be appreciated.
Thank you,
