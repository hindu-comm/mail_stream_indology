The Gita Press in Gorakhpur used to publish a Devanagari edition in extra
large print. I believe they did another large print edition with anvaya
breakdown and even some grammar lessons at one time. Whether they still
publish these editions, I have no idea. They were great favorites of mine
even though I am only short sighted.
