Those are interesting questions.  One subconscious reason can be that they
do not wish the use of Sanskrit to spread.  Another can be that they wish to
put their own spin on the sense and meaning -- due to whatever motivation.
I know a world history professor here at the University of Hawaii who tells
me that if he removes non-Christian (not anti-Christian) slant from certain
ideas that he teaches he could lose his job. There are other examples.
