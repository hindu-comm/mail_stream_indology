Ashok's observations are correct in that a cluster beginning with R' does
not make the preceding vowel heavy.  Phonologically a combination like R'y
can indeed be treated as a palatalized R.  In Marathi, this is not the
only palatalized consonant.  Many other consonants can be palatalized, but
are written as clusters without making the previous vowel heavy, e.g.
vahyaa "notebooks".  There are similarly nasal consonants which get
aspirated and are written as clusters, without making previous vowel
heavy, e.g. panha "drink made from green mango".  There is a discussion of
this phenomenon in Aparna Jha's booklet on Marathi phonology published by
Deccan College many years ago.
