Hello,

I hope some of the Sanskrit scholars on this list will be able to help me. I
am not a sanskritist, and as such was intrigued by the picture put forth by
N.S.Rajaram in his book "The politics of history".

Has anyone read this book. What is the opinion about the scholarly rigour of
the author of this book, or rather the book itself

Sugandha
