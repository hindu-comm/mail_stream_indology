Dear members of the list,
can anyone help?

>Dear Mr. Grote-Beverborg:
>
>I came across your web page of Asian E-Journals
>(http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/AsianE-Journals.html)
>and thought you might
>have some information on a subject that I am researching.  I would like
>to know if you have any leads on Asians living in Germany and writing
>either fiction or non-fiction in German.  If you have names of authors or
>their publications I would greatly appreciate your assistance.
>
>Best wishes,
