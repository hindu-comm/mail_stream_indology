Dear Mr. Pandey:
There are quite a few people who are working for the betterment of aids
victims in India. Just because, Ms. Vaid is a gay person, she should not
be made more equal than others. If her WORK for the betterment of society
qualifies her for any award/recognition she SHOULD get it. Not because she
is a gay or a woman.

Sorry for the postings unrelated to Indology.
