This discussion is now closed.  Those interested in homosexuality, AIDS,
government health policy, women's issues, and so forth -- all most
interesting topics -- are encouraged to discuss them privately or in other
appropriate forums.  There are many such forums on the Internet.

INDOLOGY is specifically for the discussion of historical, cultural,
linguistic, and related issues as they bear on classical and ancient
India.  This kind of forum is not widely available elsewhere.

All the best,
Dominik
