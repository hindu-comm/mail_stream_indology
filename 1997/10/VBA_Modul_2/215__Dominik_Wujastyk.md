I assume this posting was an accident.

*Please* take care in your postings.  If you "reply" to an INDOLOGY
posting, your reply will go to the whole group, not just to the person who
posted the original message.

Messages to INDOLOGY should not be much longer than 2k (yes, about two
screen-fuls).  If your message is much longer than that, you need to
consider some alternative means of distribution.  I can help: contact me.

All the best,
Dominik
