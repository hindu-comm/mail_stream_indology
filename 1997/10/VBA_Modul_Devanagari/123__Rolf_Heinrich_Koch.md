All members who reveived already the modul: please delete the lines at the
beginning of the program starting with "Dim". The program has to start with
the line "Selection.Find.ClearFormatting". After I find the resolution for the
bug regarding the letter "i" all of you, who reveived already the modul will
get automatically the new version.
All new interesents may please wait for a couple of days (I do not hope weeks)
