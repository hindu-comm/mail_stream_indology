The word `ordinary people' includes all who are not jIvanmukTas, whether
Hindu or any other. The very word 'jIvanmukTa' implies that he is not
bound by all that binds ordinary people, which includes Hinduism also.
There can be jIvanmukTas anywhere. For example, we hear about Meister
Eckhart.

        na mE pArthAsti kartavyam triSu lOkESu kinchana
        nAnavAptamavAptavyam vartE Eva cha karmaNi.
                                                        gita 3.22

Here we can take that Lord Krishna is talking about the state of jIvanmukta.
