Dear Brigit.

I use Pochi too. You can customize "Pochi" to display your preferable font.
If you or your department have CodeWorrior Power Plant, you can change fonts
on the find-dialog because this software is developed on it.  So it will be
a quite safe change without any bugs.

That will be helpful for searching texts with diacritics.
If you or your department don't have Power Plant,  I can do. Please contact
me.
