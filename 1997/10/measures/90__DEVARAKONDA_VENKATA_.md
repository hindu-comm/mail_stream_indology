The following usage is there in our parts
ma.n.dala or maNDala - 40 days 

vINDya(vii.n.dya) or vIgha(viigha). This apears to be the origin of 
Hindi word bIghA which is used as a measure of land area, similar to 
acre or hectare.

kumbhaka - Appears to be a measure of volume. Apte's Dictionary mentions 
a measure `kumbha' which is equal to twenty drOnas.

rajju - Can be a measure of length similar to the English measure 
chain(=66ft.).

nakha - Apte's Dictionary gives the meaning of number 20.

Hope it will be of help.

sarma.
