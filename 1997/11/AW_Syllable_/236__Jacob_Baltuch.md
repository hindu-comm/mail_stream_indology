A mora is a measure of length equivalent to that of one short syllable.
So it is exactly synonymous to Sanskrit maatraa. In the context of the
posting on Japanese names it also happens to designate what is written
with a kana. The Japanese syllabary is moraic, not syllabic.   However
note whereas Sanskrit has only 1 or 2 mora syllables, except for pluti,
Japanese has 1, 2 and 3 mora syllables;    another language with short,
long and superlong syllables is Finnish  (Just for comparison! I think!
Not sure!)
