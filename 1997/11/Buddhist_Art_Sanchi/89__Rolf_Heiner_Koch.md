The Vizvantara jAtaka (547) is shown in Sanchi the
scholars repeat since
decade of years. I am suspicious. Does anyone of
you came across the habit
in the Pali or Sanskrit literature: One man takes
one arm under the right
arm of a second man and (like usually men and
woman walk - I am sorry the
English phrase I do not know) after that the first
man spoils water out of a
pot in his open hand.
Where the habit is described that the donation of
something should be
verified by spoiling water on the open hand?
Anyone knows different interpretations of the
scenes explained traditionally
as the Vizvantara jAtaka?
