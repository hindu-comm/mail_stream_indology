I have downloaded the Times CSX-true type fonts from John Smith's
website which he mentioned in a recent posting to this list; however, at
least the Japanese version of Word 97 does not seem to approve of them -
using the fonts simply makes Word crash altogether. Has anybody else had
similar problems with Word, would anybody know the source of them, and
could anybody recommend remedies other than using a different font?
