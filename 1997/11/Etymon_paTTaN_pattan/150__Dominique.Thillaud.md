        In an article of Language, 12, 133, R.A.Hall jr. suggest to link
paTTana <? *partana with the Latin portus "passage, door, haven", a
well-known eurindien word (see engl.ford, &c.). In Indo-Iranian, we have
the av. peretuS "ford" but the root is considered as unknown in Sanskrit.
This root is in fact linked to *per- "to cross" and (except perhaps the old
alternance r/n) without direct rapport with path, panthAs, pontus, pontos.
        But your examples are very interresting ones; do you have name
alternances with tIrtha ? or saras ?
        We have perhaps a borrowing with pattana "town (MBh)" but, indeed,
the evolution 'rt' > 'TT' seems a bit strange (but phonetically very
acceptable). Do someone have an other example of it ?
