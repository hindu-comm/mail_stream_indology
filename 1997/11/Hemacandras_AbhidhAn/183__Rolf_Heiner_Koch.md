Before I start to generate an index of all the
words occuring in Hemacandra's AbhidhAnacintAmani
I would like to ask all of you for an advice or a
tip for an interested person or institution that
might probably assist me in paper-publishing this
index.
I will be able to present the complete index of
all the 1542 stanzas in the order of the Monier
Williams dictionary.
