>It is important that you take note of the following:
>
>1) The listname is unchanged and you should continue post to
indology at liverpool.ac.uk
>exactly as before.
>
>2) The email address of the new list server is listserv at liverpool.ac.uk
>(listproc is the old server and should not be used).
>
>3) The syntax of most of the commands is similar, if you want chapter and verse
>then send listserv the message:

>4) The new server provides better facilities for offering list archives.
>Archives are still available via email. In addition, you can access them at the
