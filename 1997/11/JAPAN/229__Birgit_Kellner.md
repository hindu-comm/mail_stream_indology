Linguistic form is, of course, not the only thing to go by. If you know
that a particular scholar has a university position, and if you happen
to know that the person in question is, shall we say, of a reasonably

academia are a minority, and the field of Indology is no exception to
that "rule", rather, it is one of its rather extreme examples ...
