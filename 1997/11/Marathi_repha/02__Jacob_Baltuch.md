Can _sequences_ like r+y, h+y, n+h, etc. which _do_ make the previous vowel
heavy (as opposed to phonemes ry, hy, nh, etc. which don't) occur in native
Marathi words or are they the immediate mark of a Sanskrit import?

Will the writing in all such cases (except that of r+y vs ry where there is
a special sign) be ambiguous?
