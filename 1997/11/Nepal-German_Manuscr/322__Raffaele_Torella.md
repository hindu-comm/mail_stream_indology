This is exactly what Dr Feistel also told me when I visited the
Staatsbibliothek two weeks ago. He added that this is explicitly stated in
the Nepal-Germany agreement. The reason is that the Nepalese Archives want
to reserve for themselves only the right to get money for providing
microfilm copies (to non-German scholars).
