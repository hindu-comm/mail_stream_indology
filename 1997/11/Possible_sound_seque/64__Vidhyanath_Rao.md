This is, of course, not quite true. mm can occur across a pada
boundary in manuscripts and indian editions, especially in mantras
that follow praati"saakhyas closely. Changing the first m to
anusvaara is presumably a practice that came into being to help
the reader find the pada boundaries more reliably and not the
only ``correct'' spelling.
