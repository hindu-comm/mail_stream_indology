It was referred to as 'vEngadam' or 'vEnkatam' by the AzhwArs
(Vaishnavaite saints from Tamil Nadu) as early as the 7th-8th
centuries. A detailed description of the temple, the idol and
related aspects including the controversies surrounding its
identification have been discussed in the book
'Venkateswara - Lord of Seven Hills' by P. Sitapati, published
by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

Coming to the writings of the Chinese pilgrims we need to keep in mind
that some of the observations were mere recordings of what they heard
from others rather than first hand knowledge of things.
