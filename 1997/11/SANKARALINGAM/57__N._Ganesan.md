It is a great loss to the library movement in South India.
I spent fruitful days at RMRL both in 1994 and 1996 with
the able guidance from Sri. Sankaralingam.

Will be difficult for his family and those who endear Tamil books, old and
new, to come out of this cruel act of Yama.

Remembering Sankaralingam, 51
