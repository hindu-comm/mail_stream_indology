Indology and Vyakaran members,

I have just sorted through an old and miscellaneous bunch of photocopied
articles and other transient materials about Nepal and found an article
from the Washington Times, Sept. 3, 1995, p. A8, "Nepal tries to revive
Sanskrit in education. Ethnic opposition sees no usefulness" by Shyam
Bahadur, Deutsche Presse Agentur (article distributed by Scripps Howard).
It says the Sanskrit was compulsory until the move toward vocationally
oriented education in the early 70s.  Now the government has made it
compulsory in all government-financed secondary schools, though not in
private schools.  "Various ethnic groups in Nepal have vehemently opposed
compulsory Sanskrit.  They say that high-caste Brahmins who occupy
positions of power are imposing their will, and their own languages,
dialects and culture are threatened."  I had totally forgotten about this
and heard nothing more of it, including in the newsmagazine Spotlight
which I get by airmail.  Does anyone know what happened.
