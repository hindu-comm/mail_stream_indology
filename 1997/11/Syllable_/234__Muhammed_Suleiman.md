> What is meant by a 'mora' ? And (perhaps this is a somewhat technical
> question, but surely someone can answer it) why does the number of moras
> appear to have such a marked bearing on the matter of names. Is it a rule
> restricted to names only ? I realize that Japanese is devoid of
grammatical
