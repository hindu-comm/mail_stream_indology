seriously to see urban would-be Indian intellectuals think and act
otherwise. Unfortunately, there seems little an Indologist can do
besides try to rescue for overseas academic libraries what still can
be rescued.

What is left to rescue for the overseas academic
libraries from India?

A cursory glance at the Catalagorum of Prof. K. Raja of Univ. of
Madras or the mss. list in Univ. of Pennsylvania, will indicate that
many mss. have already been rescued.

Let us hope that these will be displayed soon for free dissemination
on the internet to promote further
indological scholarship.
