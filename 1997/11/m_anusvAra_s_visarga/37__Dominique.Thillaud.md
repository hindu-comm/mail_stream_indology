        I'm perhaps stupid but 'h' is a standard notation of breath and it
seems to me the real h and the aspirated occlusives are always followed by
a vowel, and the visarga never. Hence, why don't use simply 'h' for the
visarga ?

        IF nextCh IS space OR IN consonants THEN visarga ELSE h END
