Hmm, excellent point, thanks.

To be pedantic it is not strictly, stricly true (cf gRhNAti, azvAbhyAm,
where h is followed by N or bh by y) but it looks like your point still
stands that I will always be able to restaure visarga from the context.
The algorithm will be a bit more complicated though.
