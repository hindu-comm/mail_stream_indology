Now you're stepping into upadhaaniiya territory! Is reaching for shift
really that burdensome?! :-> Just consider it phlangeal calisthenics.

Also, one point to consider is whether you will be processing this text
into Devanagari script. Having to convert from your scheme to another
scheme each time would cause you a greater pain than just sticking to an
already defined scheme.

Best,
