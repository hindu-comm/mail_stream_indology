Dear Listmembers:
I would appreciate very much from any body who has access to the original for
the following:
AitareyabrAhmaNa 32.10
TaittirIyabrAhmaNa 3.10.1.1-3 and 3.10.10.2
In the boondogs of midsouth I can not even get the translations, let alone the
original sanskrit. I would be very grateful for the originals. Thanks.
_Narahari Achar
