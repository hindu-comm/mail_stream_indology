You're of course right that in this context "to say honey" in not just to
utter the word "honey" but to say "honey" _to someone_ (whether out of
affection or playing on this content of the expression). My point,
however, is that there is no functional difference between "to call
someone 'honey'" and "to honey someone". There may be good reasons to
have a linguistic technical term such as "delocutive" for the latter kind
of verb, but this does not make it a speech act of its own.

Whether a joke or not, the example illustrates that in principle one can
go on forming delocutives at higher and higher meta levels which do not
really alter the speech-act-character of the expressions that are so
"delocutived" (to stay in style).
