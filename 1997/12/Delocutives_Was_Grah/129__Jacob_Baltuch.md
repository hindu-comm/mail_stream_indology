If "guruM tvaMkrtya" in the above means "having used/said "you" to address
the teacher" then yes. Is this what it means here? I'm specifically asking
about a _transitive_ use of those kR compound. Is this the case here?

(Incidentally that's the same difference between the delocutive meaning
"to utter X" (intransitive) and "to call someone X, to say X to someone"
(transitive) which was mentioned in another post. Maybe one should use
the term "delocutive" only for the latter use?)
