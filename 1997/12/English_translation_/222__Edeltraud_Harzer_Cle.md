I just wanted to add a little note to Carlos Lopez' information:
there is another translation of the MBH by M.N. Dutt, recently
reprinted by Parimal Publ in Delhi (1994).

Pratap Chandra Roy's publication is a translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli,
as has been disclosed in the foreword of the reprint by Munshiram
Manoharlal, Delhi, 1990. Pratap Chandra Roy has been its publlisher
(as was his wife), rather than translator.

Indiana University in Bloomington has an almost complete set of the
original publication.

van Buitenen completed unfortunately only 5 books of the whole work,
but it is still in print and available from Borders Bookstores and
probably others. In paper it is not too expensive.

Good luck.
