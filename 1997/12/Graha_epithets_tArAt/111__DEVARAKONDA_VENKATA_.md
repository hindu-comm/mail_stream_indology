If tAra can represent tArA, I have one interpretation

tArakAmah = one who desires tArA . It is just like `svargakAmah', `bhUtikAmah'
etc.

tArakAmayOh will be possessive dual form i.e., the two who desire tArA

saGgrAmah tArakAmayOh = war of the two who desire tArA

If the visarga at the end is lost and somebody interpreted `O' at the end
as due to transformation of visarga, you will get saGgramah tArakAmayah.

sarma.
