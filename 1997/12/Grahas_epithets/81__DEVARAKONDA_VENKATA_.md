I have gone through the relevent portion of the Vishnu Purana. The name of
the wife of bRhaspati is stated as tArA only. Nowhere as tArakA. Only the
name of the war is given as tArakAmaya.

        `Evam ca tayOr atIvOgrasangramas tArAnimittas tArakAmayO nAmAbhUt.'

On the basis of this single occurance concluding that bRhaspati's wife has
also a name tArakA will be possible if we give the word `tArakAmaya' the
meaning `full of tArakA' or `pervaded by tArakA'. This sounds a very odd
way of describing that war. That was a war `for tArA' or `because of tArA'.
MMW's explanation 'for the love of tArA' may not be very much off the mark.

regards,

sarma.
