Dear Mr.tatelman,

        In puranic literature we have three tArAs

        1. bRhaspati's wife tArA
        2. vAli's wife tArA
        3. hariscandrA's wife tArAmati also called tArA

In addition to these three you have in budhhist tantrA's two godesses

        1. White tArA
        2. Blue or black tArA

These have later entered the Hindu tantrA's also.

We are discussing here the bRhaspati's wife tArA.

regards,

sarma.
