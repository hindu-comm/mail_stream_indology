I do not think it has just to do with the Madhwa
tradition. Madhwa tradition is only a few hundred years
old. The question is also - why is Shri Madhwacharya
thought to be a incarnation of Hanuman.

Traditionally, Karnataka is also considered the area for
the original Kishkindha region. Avani in Kolar District
of Karnataka  is also a place where Sita brought up both
Lava & Kusha. The temples in Avani are in very bad shape
and are in urgent need of maintenance work.

BTW, Kolar has a large monkey population and especially in
the afternoon it is a common sight to see a large group
of monkeys descend onto the town and plunder all the
mango  and coconut trees.
