Dear members of the list,

An Indian colleague has asked me to forward a request for the correct
spelling of the name of the following Danish scholar, and his address:

        Viggo Braun, working on Assamese

An email address would be helpful. Kindly reply to me at:

Thank you.

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
