Ekalavya cut off his thumb as a "fee" demanded by his teacher. It was
the teacher himself (DroNa) who asked for such a fee, even though he
had not actually been Ekalavya's instructor. DroNa had refused to accept
Ekalavya as his pupil out of prejudice. Ekalavya went away, built a
statue of DroNa for worship, and practised alone until he reached
mastery. Drona asked for the thumb so that his favourite pupil, Arjuna,
would not have a rival in archery. He had said to Arjuna "No archer on
earth shall ever be your equal."
You can read all this in van Buitenen, The Mahabharata, U. Chicago Press,
1973, 1980, book I, section 123.1 (pp. 270 ff.). And of course in the
original Sanskrit, if you prefer. Good luck.
