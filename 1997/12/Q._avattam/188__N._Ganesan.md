    Q. avattam
    **********

I looked in the University of Koeln - IITS web site for the
Tamil word, "avattam". Its meaning is "evil, calamity".

I need a textual occurence of "avattam" where this word has
the abovesaid meaning.

Can someone look it up in Madras university Tamil Lexicon
and give a sentence from a relevent reference?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
