The reference is to Nammalvar's Tiruvaymoli 10.3.9:
...akappaTil avarOTum ninnoTu AnkE avattankaL viLaiyum

The general meaning of avattam here is "awful things" will come to pass. For
a full translation of this set of verses and Pillan's (11th century)
manipravala commentary see my book (co authored with John Carman): The Tamil
Veda: Pillan's interpretation of the Tiruvaymoli (Univ. of Chicago press, 1989).
