Beside nIlAnjana-giri or -caya (this is used several times in the
Mahabharata, too), prabhinnaAnjana is often used in sanskrit-literature in
similar contexts, when something dark or greyish or a mixture of white and
black (zyAmAvad√•ta!) is described. About this latter term, meaning 'mixed
collyrium', Claus Vogel has written an article in Indo-Iranian Journal 10
(1967/68): 171-176.
