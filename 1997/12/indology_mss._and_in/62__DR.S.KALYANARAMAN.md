The issues are larger than mere copyright issues.
WTO members are still debating the issues related to
the preservation and protection of traditional
knowledge systems. There was a case in the USA when
Donald Trump was given the right to use TAJMAHAL as
his TradeMark. There were also cases involving the
patenting of neem and turmeric products.
I suppose world heritage documents should be cherished...
with due regard to national sentiments. Laws and international
agreements will evolve within this framework.
