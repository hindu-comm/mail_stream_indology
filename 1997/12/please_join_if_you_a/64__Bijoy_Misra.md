Abstract: From ancient times, pronunciation and metrical recitation of
Sanskrit have been a scholarly and artistic exercise.  Proper
pronunciation and recitation have been believed to have special healing
effect in ceremonies and worships.  Pandit Bhattacharya will present
examples of vedic recitations and move on to the recitation of puranas
and shlokas.  Finally, the dramatic effects of Sanskrit prose will
be presented with the recitation of "Raghuveera Gadyam", the story of
Ramayana.
