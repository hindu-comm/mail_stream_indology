As I have quoted in my earlier posting the above sentence occurs in the
viSNu purANa Edition (Gita Press, Gorakhpur) I have, as

"EvaM ca tayor atIvograsangrAmas tArAnimittas tArakAmayO nAmAbhUt"

Usually Gita Press editions try to maintain textual accuracy. I will be
very much obliged if you can let me know the edition from which you are
quoating the above sentence.
