are the terms for a certain type of literal
sources. Since the definition according to the
Nybyb-sources are not sufficient I am asking
kindly the members for any advice for literal
source where carita (purANa) "hero-legend?" is set
into contrast to kalpita "fiction?" and/or where
udAharaNa "example" is limited from dRSTAnta
"simplified dogmatical expositions for the
ordinaries?". KAvya-theories are lesser helpful.
