George N. Roerich son of Yuri Nicolai Roerich, this one an aristocrat,
painter, mystic and Tibetologist who was an enigma to British colonial
administration in the beginning of this century while he was living in
Tibet.
I think there is museum with his name in the U.S and also a house in the
centre of Moscow with the inscription that there lived George Roerich.
