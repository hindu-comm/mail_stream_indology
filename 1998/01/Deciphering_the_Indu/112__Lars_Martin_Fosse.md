Here are a few suggestions:

Asko Parpola, "Deciphering the Indus Script", Cambridge U.P. 1994, which was
reviewed in Frontline on Feb. 21 197.

Furthermore, Manohar some time ago sent two lists of books for and against
the "Aryan Invasion Theory" to Indology. They should be retrievable from the
Indology database.

Natwar Jha has attempted to interpret the Indus script language as Sanskrit.

many scholars in the West would accept the alleged relation to Sanskrit. But
this theory has a fair amount of adherents in India, I believe.

Best regards,
