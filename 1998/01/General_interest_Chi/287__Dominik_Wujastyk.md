Council on East Asian Libraries
http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~felsing/ceal/welcome.html

The Committee on East Asian Libraries was announced in the January 20
issue. Its purpose was and is to act as a forum for East Asian subject
librarians to cooperatively develop information resources. The site is
highlighted by connections to East Asian subject libraries, selected other
international libraries, East Asian and other publishers, connections to
CEAL member libraries, and seven meta-pages of pointers to country related
information, as well as a pointer to the East Asia WWW Virtual Library. [JS]
