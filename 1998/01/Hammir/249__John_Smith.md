I don't know of any Hindi poems, but there are said to be numerous
Rajasthani poems on HammIr: the best known is BhAMDau VyAsa's HammIrAyaNa,
which is also pretty early (firmly dated 1481 A.D.). It was edited by
BhaMvarlAl NAhTA and published by the Sadul Rajasthani Research Institute,
Bikaner in V.S. 2017.
