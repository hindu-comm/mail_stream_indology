To the best of my knowledge, fonts are not copyrightable. ("Mere" variations
of the letterforms are deemed insufficiently original to merit protection.)

Commercial fonts, however, typically come with license agreements. These
agreements spell out what you may do with them. For a noncommercial font, try
checking with the creator.
