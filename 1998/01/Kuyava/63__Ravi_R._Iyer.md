while we are talking of variants, may I bring up another word..
"kUyavA" which appears in the 4th anuvAka of the chamakaprashnah

and has been translated as a grain of some sort.. (according to T. R.
Rajagopala Aiyar, they are millets).

-Ravi



>        In relation to the discussion of Kuyava, a previous message
>brought up the word kUyavasA.  I am not sure if the two words are related,
>but certainly the latter expression has a parallel in the word sUyavasa
>which is understood by Surya Kanta to mean "full of grass".  Related
>expressions are sUyavasAd, sUyavasin, and sUyavasyu.  Most likely, the
>personal name Kuyava is not related to either of these words.

==============================================================
Subhaashitam: (Ancient Sanskrit Couplet)

||Kshamaa balam a-shaktaanaam; shaktaanaam bhUshaNam kshamaa|
  Kshamaa vashikrte loke, kshamayA: kim na sidhyati ? | ||

Subhashitasya anuvaadam (Translation):

Forgiveness is the strength of the weak.
Forgiveness embellishes the mighty.
In a world that can be conquered by forgiveness,
what is not possible by forgiveness?
