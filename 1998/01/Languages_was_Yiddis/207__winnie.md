I disagree with this statement. Not seldom the words of a language
which served as tool for transmitting concepts belonging to the
Weltanschauung of a culture may become the very substance,
the very abstract object conceived.So the words and consequently
the language incorporate values.Not even metalanguages as that of, say,
Pânini in his Ashtâdhyayî, are that neutral.
