Oh yes, or something near to distinction of zabda and pada. What a reader
reads are meaninfull words, not just devoided or neutral linguistic signs
and the charge imbueded therein is proportional to the underlying semantic
or "cultural" understanding of those bedeutungtrÃ¤gende words.

Yes but when you manipulate it you're having corresponding cultural
resonance to that. In the case of Faschism or Ccmmunism they had an
ideological brainwashing together with ideological activism going on at the
same time. Thus the cultural background was creating "reality" for the
shifts of meaning of a number of words and concepts as well as the eventual
introduction of new ones.
