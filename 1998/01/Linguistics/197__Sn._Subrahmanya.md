A rational methodology, requires that there be some kind of verification.
If it's just a leap of faith then it becomes religion, not scientific enquiry.

comparision of all major Indian languages has never been done (atleast until
the late 60's).
I will really appreciate it, if you can point me to a study, which compares ALL
major Indian languages - not just 1 or 2 from a presupposed language family.

There are many people who have doubts about comparitive reconstruction.
The problem is not about the contribution of linguistics. The question is
whethar it is dependable enough to base ALL historical reconstruction.

It seems to me, because of the 150year baggage,Indologists seem to be
spinning their wheels in the sand of linguistic evidence without using
inputs from fields like archeology, astronomy and a scientific/mathematical
evaluation of original sources.

Now, I will get off my soapbox :)
