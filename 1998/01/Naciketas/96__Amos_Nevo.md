Shalom (Peace, Shanti) to all,

I am a Ph.D. student at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, new to this
list. I am writing a thesis about Naciketas, the human hero of
Kathopanishad, and his occurrences in other scriptures.

I shall be very grateful for any information about other researchers
dealing at present with this subject.

I am trying to get in touch with Y.K. Wadhwani, who published articles
about Naciketas' name. I shall be glad to get any information that will
help me in this matter.
