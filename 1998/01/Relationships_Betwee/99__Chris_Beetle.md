Feature of DvIpa             Deva            Ocean
----------------         -------------   ----------------
Indian fig tree              sun         sugar cane juice
{Plaksa)

Silk-cotton tree             moon            liquor
(Salmali)

Kusa grass                fire (Agni)         ghee

Mt. Kraunca              water (Varuna)       milk

fig tree (Saka)           air (Vayu)         yogurt

Lotus (Puskara)             Brahma         fresh water
----------------------------------------------------------

In the rows of the above table there seem to be some relationships:

Fire and ghee are used in fire sacrifices.
A lotus is the source of Brahma's origin.

>â€‰From your knowledge of the PurANas and similar writings are their other
relationships
between the features of the dvIpas and the demigods (devas) or the demigods
(devas) and the oceans that you are aware of?

Thank you for your help.
