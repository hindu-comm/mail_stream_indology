V.ll. for 1.13.25a:

D2 mannAmnA; T G1.4.5 svanAmnI (T2 -mnA). G2.3 sA hi jAyA; M1 (before
corr.) sanAmA vA. T1 G5 vA (for yA).

V.ll. for 1.176.35d (where bhavitrI na mRSA in text is marked with
"doubtful" wiggly line):

S (except T1 G1.2) kRSNA svasA na mRSA prabravImi.


Someone else will have to do the AB passages, I'm afraid -- I don't have
easy access to anything useful on that.
