Thank you very much Vidyasankar Sundaresan for such a comprehensive article
on the Sankaracarya of the North. I very much appreciate your intelligent
and comprehensive response to my question and you have helped me understand
a little of what is going on there.

A question came up in the reading about qualifications. Who determines the
qualifications of a candidate put forth as a Sankaracarya and what
qualifications might they be? If one is deemed qualified as Santananda how
could be become disqualified?

Thank you again for your response.

Martin
