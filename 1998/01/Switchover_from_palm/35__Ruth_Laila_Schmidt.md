Dear members of the list,

Can anyone provide information about when manuscript copyists left off
writing on palm leaves and began to write on paper? I am assuming (in all
ignorance) that this occurred prior to the widespread adoption of the
printing press, in preference to copying, but all corrections and
references will be gratefully accepted.

I am especially interested in when this transition took place in Nepal.

Thank you!

Best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
