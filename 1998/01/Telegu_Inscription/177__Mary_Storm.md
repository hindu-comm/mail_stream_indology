Dear Bh. Krishnamurti,
Thank you for your very kind offer of translation help! I shall get a
good 8"X10" black and white glossy printed (I now only have slides) and
mail it off to you. So in a month or less, you will get a photo packet
from San Francisco.
Meanwhile, if you are curious, these stones are in the outer courtyard
of the Archaeological Museum in the Public Gardens in Hyderabad. If you
find yourself in the area you might find it interesting to take a look
at them.
With gratitude,
Mary Storm
