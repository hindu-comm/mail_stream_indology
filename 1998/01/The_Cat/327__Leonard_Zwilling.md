I'm presently working on a Tibetan text which is purported to be a
translation from a Sanskrit original. In this text the cat is used as an
example for a person of savage and devious mentality which is the way cats
are still customarily viewed by Tibetans. Can someone tell me
whether this conforms to an/the Indian attitude towards the cat. Has anyone
written on the cat in Sanskrit literature. Thanks. Leonard Zwilling
