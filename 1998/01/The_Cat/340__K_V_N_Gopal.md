Even if it is not truly representative of people's attitude to 'pets',
it is interesting to note the incident of Yudhisthira and the attachment
he had to the 'dog' which accompanies him in the 'swargaarohana parva' of
Mahabharata. Another story is of Bharata the son of Dushyanta playing
with lion cubs (as pets) as a child.
