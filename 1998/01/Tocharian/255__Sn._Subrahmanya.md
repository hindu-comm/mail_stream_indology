Distance wise Tajikistan is close to India than any other major
places. Your point is whethar the people could have crossed these mountains.
Buddhist paintings indicate that there definitely was flow of people and
exchange of ideas,also Indian history is replete with instances of people
sweeping down these mountains into the plains for eg:Hunas,Kushans.

On a different and present day note: These days you will find a tremendous
number of Tajiks and other Central Asian people flying into New Delhi for
trading goods.This explosive increase in travel and trade occured after the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
