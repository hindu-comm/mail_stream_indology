As far as I know water is ritualistically offered in the following ways

1.arghya - oblative sUrya, gods, pitRs and atithis
2.pAdya - to wash feet
3.AcamanIya - to wet the mouth
4.pAnIya - to drink
5.tarpaNa -  another kind of oblative to gods and pitRs
6.snAna - for bath
7.prOkSaNa - sprinking of water to purify things
8.upasparzana - to touch water to purify oneself

There may be some more.

regards,

sarma.
