About the Song of Bhagavad some wag did wax:

>My God, who on earth would be interested in reading this classical textext =
> in a german patois ?

To which Sara the Quick of Wit did respond:

> Yiddish is a literary language in which thousands of books have been
> written.                                                              guage

You think the German patois the gentleman was referring to was Yiddish?
I just assumed he was talking about English.
