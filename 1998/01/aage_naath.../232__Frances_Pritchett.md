Although I feel the temerity of disagreeing with an official proverb
dictionary, I suggest a slightly more colloquial reading would be

"(Neither) a nose-ring in front, nor a tail-rope behind."

The initial "na" in neither-nor constructions is VERY commonly omitted-- I
can think of countless other examples in proverbs (e.g., jaan na pahcaan
baRii biibii salaam), poetry, and common speech.  (Whereas in an if-then
or when-then construction, the "to" is almost never omitted.)

And this reading very well corresponds to the meaning suggested by the
dictionary. It's at least another possibility, I would say...
