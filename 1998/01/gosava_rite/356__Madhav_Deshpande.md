        Gosava is a type of one-day sacrificial rite modelled on a
Soma-sacrifice called Ukthya.  Here the host is given an Abhisheka with
cow's milk.  Details may be found in TaittirIya-BrAhmaNa (2.7.6) and
tANDya-brAhmaNa (19.13.10).  By this sacrifice, the YajamAna is said to
gain his own kingdom, svrAjyaprApti.  The priestly fee is 10,000 cows, but
there is no sacrifice of the cow.  This is prescribed as a remedy for
killing a Brahman, brahmahatyA, see: Manu 11.74.  Details of this rite are
to be found in a number of SrautasUtras, KAtyAyana (22.11.6), Apastamba
(22.25.18) etc.
