Re: Edwin Bryant's inquiry

Please look up the references under da:ngulapa;n;na/dva:ngulapa;n;na (=
Skt. dvya:ngula-praj;na) in Pali (e.g. Rhys Davids and Stede p. 333, right
hand column, bottom).

Tracing this and similar expressions in Prakrit and Skt dictionaries and
concordances should be fruitful, provided they are  interpreted in a
context-sensitive way, without reading too much of present thought in them.
