How is this:
AAvazyaka-cuurNi for the illustration of the term
utpattikii buddhi we read
how a young monk defeats a female wandering
ascetic, after she had made the proclamation:
Whatever someone does, I also can do it (jo jaM
karei taM mae kaayavvaM).
The young monk, creating a lotus (in the sand)
with his urin, won the contest.
 (teNa [khuDDaga] saagaariyaM daaiuuNa kaaiyaae
paumaM lihiyaM. saa na tarai. jiyaa)

Betreff: women's intelligence


>Can anyone point me to any references in any
genre of Sanskrit texts where

essentialized gender group (ie

less intelligent than men?

>I know there are various tirades about women's
fickleness and propensity

sannyasa sutras, etc, but I am
>particularly looking for statements referring to
the intelligence, or
>rational faculty, of women as a group.  The
Sanskrit references (and
>context) of any such statements would be helpful.
