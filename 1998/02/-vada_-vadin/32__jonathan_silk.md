There is such a list, by SHIZUTANI Masao. While the discussion and
abstracts of the Indian Buddhist Inscriptions he treats are in Japanese,
all names are printed in Roman type, are indexed, and provided with Lueders
numbers.  Take a look!  (From memory: Indo Bukkyo Hibun Mokuroku --- but
somehow I think that is not quite right. As always, my copy is at home :-(
