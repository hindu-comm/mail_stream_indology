 There is a very simple explanation of this statement.
Please refer to VP (1. 3. 10):

         ayanam dakSiNam rAtrirdevAnAm uttaram dinam

The ahorAtra referred (2.8.45-6) is the ahoratra of the devAs, which
corresponds to one year of the mAnavAs. Hence the sun progresses through all
the rAzi s in one ahorAtra.

It is unfortunate that sometimes the statements are misunderstood and comments
about the incapability of simple observations by ancient Indian astronomers are
hurled. Pingree swears that Indian astronomers were not interested in making
the simplest of observations.
