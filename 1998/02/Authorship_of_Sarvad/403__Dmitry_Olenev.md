I cannot agree with this assertion; it's enough to remember a great
naiyayika Raghunaatha Siroma.ni (or Vaacaspati Mi'sra) to understand
the simple fact that it was well possible for Indian philosophers to
be adepts of several traditions.
   Furthermore, nyaya is intellectual tradition, not spiritual, so I
don't see any reasons for which a naiyayika couldn't be a vedantist,
i. e. an adept of spiritual tradition.

  Yours, Dmitry Olenev
