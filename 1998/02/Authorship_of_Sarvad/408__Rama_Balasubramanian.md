Yes I was mistaken. There is no verse saluting vidyAsha.nkara. I
checked iit up yesterday. Sorry
about that.

In my book the last verse says that the crest jewel of all systems,
namely the shA.nkara vedAnta is explained elsewhere and hence not
explained here! This is very strange. I forget the name of the
translator now, but it's a reprint by Motilal Banarsidas of an early
20th century translation by some European scholar. Anyway, the
footnote by the translator says that the "elsewhere" probably refers
to the pa.nchadashI.

Rama.
