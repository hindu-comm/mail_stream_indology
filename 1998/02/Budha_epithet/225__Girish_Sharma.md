There is an epithet of the graha Budha,
        piya"ngugulikaabhaasa
that seems to mean the "One with the
appearance of balls of priya"ngu."  According
to Apte's Sankrit dictionary priya"ngu is
a kind of millet.  Perhaps "balls" refers to
the shape of millet grain.

Can someone confirm that priya"ngu grain is
green in color?
