This was exactly my problem with the OED's derivation of curry from the
Tamil word kaRi, since in almost the same breath (or was it Hobson
Jobson?) they talk of it being first used as "caril" by the Portugese.
Given that the Portugese landed on the west, and not east, it was a little
difficult to reconcile these two etymologies.

So it seemed like it had to be  either

  Dravidian (koDagu?) kaRi--> Portugese caril --> English curry
or
  Tamil kaRi --> English curry ; AND west coast kaRi --> Portugese caril.

This is fascinating, but I have a problem with suggesting this as the
origin of the western concept of "curry", since this ka.di is a very
specific dish, not the coverall concept of a
spicy-stew-that-Indians-serve-with-rice.
