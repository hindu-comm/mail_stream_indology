Does the difference in consistency/coninuity of usage imply anything about
which word was the "original" one for pepper? I find it fascinating that
miLaku should still be in use as the word for pepper, while connotations
for kaRi should have been so variable over time (not to speak of its
mutation into curry powder, etc in modern times and in other languages).
