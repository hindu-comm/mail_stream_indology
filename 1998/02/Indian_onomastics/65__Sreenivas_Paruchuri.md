Have been forgetting to quote one more book, on Indian Onomastics, I am aware
of;
        Ti: The book of Indian Names
        Au: Rajaram, Mehrotra (Ed)
        PP: New Delhi
        PU: Rupa & co.
        PY: 1994
        ISBN: 81-7167-149-7.

I should add that I haven't read the complete book, but just have one essay
that is of interest to me; "Telugu personal names - a structural analysis"
by Andre Sjoberg (pp. 147-160).

Regards,
Sreenivas
