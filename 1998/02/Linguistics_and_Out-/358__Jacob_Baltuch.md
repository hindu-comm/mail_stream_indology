One last question. Edwin Bryant wrote:

Does this include most Indian linguists???

I just can't imagine how one could learn
proper modern linguistics if one's linguistic
training included "theories" that Sanskrit
was identical to PIE or that IA and Dravidian
were close genetic relatives. That would
be really something on a par with the Marr
madness in Soviet linguistics. I do hope the
answer is no.
