        Not an answer but a linked query.
Why translate pazupati by "Lord of animals", "Herr der Tiere"? pazu,
opposed to mRga, seems to be just the livestock, the domestic animals; and,
as far I know, mRgapati is not a name of ziva nor rudra but of lion or
tiger. The distinction between domestic and wild animals is very important:
only the first ones are sacrified. The terms "Lord of cattle", "Herr des
Viehes" would be perhaps better.
        Any comment?
        Regards,
Dominique
