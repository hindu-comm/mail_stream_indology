  The Director
  Oriental Research and Manuscripts Library
  University of Kerala
  Kariavattom 695581
  Trivandrum, India


The former Director, Dr Vijayan, has recently retired, and the new
Director is Dr P. P. Thampi.

I have a colleague in Trivandrum who uses email regularly, and who has
friends at the MSS library.  Let me know if this would help.

All the best,
Dominik
