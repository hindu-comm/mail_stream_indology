Want to know the titles of texts on Lokayata philosophy in Sanskrit
and other Indian languages. I read that Madhava Vidyaranya's
Sarva Darshana Samgraha has few quotations. Where can I find
Brhaspati's sutras taught to Indra? Is there a complete text
in Sanskrit on Lokayatam?

The reason I am asking this is because, in Tamil there is late
11th century/early 12th century vaLamaTal prabandham
by Kaviccakravartti JayamkoNTaar. It is only 550 lines
and expresses Lokayata philosophy. Of course,  Buddhist
Manimekalai, Jain Neelakesi and Saiva Siddhanta SivaJaana
Siddhiyaar refutes Lokayata princilpes. A palm leaf mss.
of the Lokayata prabandham is at GOML, Madras. The other
is at Perur Adheenam near Coimbatore.

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
