I have a vague recollection of having seen a mention of an article
by A.L.Basham (who I suppose should be the same as the other one)
on the naastika, lookaayata and other caarvaaka somewhere but I can't
remember where. If you find it (assuming it really exists:) maybe
that could be a a source of sources for you.
