George Clifford WhitworthÂ´s "An Anglo-Indian Dictionary", Kegan Paul, Trench
& Co., London 1885, reprinted by IDS, Gurgaon/New Delhi 1976 gives the
following definition (p. 207, s.v. Mistry):
"Mistry. [A corruption of mister, or of the French maistre.] A head smith or
head armourer, or head workman of any kind. The word is also used among
Europeans and their servants to designate the cook."
