I just want to add or supplement to the points that have already been made
by pointing out that in South Africa "Mistri" "Maistrie" ( spelled in
different ways) currently exists as a family name among some Gujarati and
Hindi speaking families. This certainly has to do with the colonial context
and most likely it came via English.
