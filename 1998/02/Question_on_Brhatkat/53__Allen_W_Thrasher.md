Is Dr. D. A. Nelson a faculty in a Asian studies dept?

Don Nelson, sometime assistant professor of Sanskrit at Chicago, moved
into a career in computers in the 1980s.  He was living in Washington DC
in 1984 when I came here, but we have lost touch.  He doesn't come to S.
Asia related things in the DC area.
