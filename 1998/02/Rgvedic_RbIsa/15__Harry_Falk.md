Most likely. There are two references, TMK, in the suutra-literature,
listing different sorts of meat preparation. One very close to
aama, raw meat, is arbisa, i.e. prepared in a rbisa. It could be
smoked meat, so that arbisa could be something functioning as
a smoking cabinet. If i remember it properly arbisa meat is
forbidden for grhasthas.
