There was an 1892 Sanskrit adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
somewhere on the Subcontinent.  Supposedly there is a text of this
production.  The best bibliographical citation I can find is as follows:

Krishnamacharya, R.
        Vasantikasvapnam.  Kumbhakonam,
        the translator, 1892. xvi, 70p. 20cm.
        An adaptation.

Can anyone tell me any more about this?  Anybody know where it was
produced?  Most of all--anybody know how I might go about getting my hands
on a copy?

Thanks.

Dave
