I don't know how widely it is known that the late Shankaracharya
Shantananda Sarasvati published a collection of spiritual stories:

Title:  The man who wanted to meet God: myths and stories that explain the
        inexplicable.
Author: His Holiness Shantanand Saraswati
Publ.:  Element Books Ltd., Shaftesbury, Dorset SP7 8BP, UK.
Date:   1996 (first ed. 1992)
ISBN:   1-85230-843-5

The blurb says: "His Holiness Shantanand Saraswati was Shankaracharya of
Jyotir Math in Northern India from 1953 until his retirement in 1980.  His
Holiness comes from the ancient Advaita or nondualist tradition of
knowledge and meditation and is one of Indas' greatest living saints.  He
continues the work of his predecessor HH Brahmananda Saraswati (Gurudeva),
in making mantra meditation available to people of many religious
traditions."

Best wishes,
Dominik
