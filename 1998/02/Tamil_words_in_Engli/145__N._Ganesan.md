Subtitle: mAyAmOhana avatAra
*******************************

Interestingly, anti-linguists remind us of the brahmanical
redaction of the Buddha legend in Vishnupurana. The main intent is
to lead to confusion.

The Vishnupurana regards Buddha as a mischievous seducer
and illusion maker who appeared in the world to delude
the demons.

Anti-linguist elites in India dislike Robert Caldwell to the core.
Before him, South Indians were conventionally taught that
all Dravidian languages come from Sanskrit. I hear that from
some elites from South even today.
