   I would like to thank all those who answered my question of khyaati
theory; all answers were very essential and helpful. Especially I
appreciated the reference to Schmithusen's book about Vibhramaviveka.
   My problem was to know the point of buddhist theories of false
cognition AS EXPLAINED IN BUDDHIST SOURCES because I'm not sure of
maadhyasthyam of brahmanist philosophers who critisized these theories.

   Sincerely Yours, Olenev Dmitry.
