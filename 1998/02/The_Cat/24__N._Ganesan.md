Interesting. Is this told in some book of the Kadamba period?
Or, is it a folk story? Any reference?

Reminds me of the famous Chola story. A king, by the name of
Manuniithi Cholan got his son killed. Because during a chariot
ride, the son killed a calf. The mother cow came crying to the
Chola palace and rang the bell. That bell usually is rung by
a petitioner, then the palace staff listen to their grievances.
This story is told in Cilappatikaaram onwards and
pracAsti portion in 100s of Chola inscriptions.
