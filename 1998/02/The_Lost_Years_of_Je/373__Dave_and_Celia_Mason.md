Right.  We were talking about "lost tribe" status, correct?  The Mormons
don't group these "Nephites" and "Lamanites" with the "lost tribes."

By the way:

I'm still looking for the Sanskrit "Midsummer Night's Dream" from 1892.
I've received one lead so far.  Can anyone confirm that this was published
in Tamil Nadu?  Any other information about this would be much appreciated.

Dave
