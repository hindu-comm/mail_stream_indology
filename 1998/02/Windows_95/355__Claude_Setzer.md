Windows 95 itself should have nothing to do with fonts, although some
software reportedly is less than compatible with some fonts. Evidently some
font generators do not completely follow the standards and have problems
when software goes to new version. I have used several different fonts on
several different versions of word processors, and have not noticed any
problems.

My favorite software is Ralph Bunker's Vedatype, which has a fast and
efficient stand alone version and also can support Microsoft word for slower
typing but fancier text. It also can support a wide variety of fonts, when
trained. Including Peter Freund's excellent devanagari font with over a
thousand character pieces, transliteration, etc. He has experimental
mappings for Telegu and Tamil fonts.
