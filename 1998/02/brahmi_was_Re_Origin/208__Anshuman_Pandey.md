According to what I read some time ago, the epithet "devanaampiya" was
used by Ashoka's predecessors (namely, grandpa Chandragupta) and that
Ashoka merely retained the name in his inscriptions. I think scholars
initially thought that "devanaampiya" was a personal name, but after
discovering inscriptions pre-dating Ashoka they believed it to only be an
epithet. I'll dig up the text in which I read this and confirm/deny my
statements. Dr. Richard Salomon would surely know.
