Perhaps Katyayana (the grammarian) in a varttika to
        .sa.s.thyaa aakro"se (6.3.20 in Pathak/Chitrao's Sutrapatha)
Katyayana adds: devaanaampriya iti ca. (This seems to give an
abusive sense.)

But this is not the earliest reference available. I have seen it
in the Maitrayanisamhita (although written as two distinct words
in von Schroeder's edition).
