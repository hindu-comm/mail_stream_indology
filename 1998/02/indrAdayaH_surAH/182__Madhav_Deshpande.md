The list of gods beginning with Indra commonly occurs in the Nala story
from the Mahabharta.  See the selection of this story in Lanman's Sanskrit
reader: P.7, line 10, 13 (mahendrAdyAH); p. 9, line 7 (Sakro'gnir varuNo
yamaH); p. 11, line 9 (devAS cendrapurogamAH).
        All the best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
