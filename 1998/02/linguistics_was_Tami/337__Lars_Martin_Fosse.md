There is no attempt to take away the authorship of the Vedas and Sanskrit!
All Western Indologists recognize the Vedic literature as a specifically
Indian creation. What they say, however, is that themes and ideas that we
find in the Vedic literature sometimes are older than the Vedas, and are
shared by other IE peoples. This, of course, may be felt to be provocative
by some Indians who are used to regard the Vedas not as a "historical"
product, but as a phenomenon originating beyond space and time.
