Is there anybody out there with access to this article? I am pretty certain
that the University of Oslo does not have it, and I would very much like to
read it for a talk I am giving on March 4th.

If anyone could send me a copy of the article - or fax it to me - I would be
eternally grateful, not to mention the punya that that person would achieve
(I think we are practically talking instant moksha here!)

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
