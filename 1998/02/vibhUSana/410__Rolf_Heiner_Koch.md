Apart few vedic issues, where vi-bhUSa- has to be explained as "working for someone else, etc.", I am looking for later sources with a similar meaning. Middle Indian occurances of vi-bhUSa-na "working for someone else, etc." would be fine. Someone can help me? Probably in connection with a term describing "property"?
I am not searching for vibhUSana = "decoration, etc." (which of course is also done by someone to the object of decoration)
