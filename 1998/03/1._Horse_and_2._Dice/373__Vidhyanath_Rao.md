But that assumes that the Celtic and Indic rites show similarities
in details. I am not sure that that is warranted. What I have read
suggestes that the Celtic rite was at coronation, involved a mare
and the king who bathed in the broth. In the a"svamedha, it is a
stallion, is not regular and not connected with coronation.
