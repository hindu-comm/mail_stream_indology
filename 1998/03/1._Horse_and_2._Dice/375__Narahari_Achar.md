Hello, I  have been a silent, but interested watcher of this scholarly
debate which has been taking place at a breakneck speed, due in part to my lack
of expertise. Now that AIT is no longer the theory of choice of the scholars,
but AMT is. Countless children in India still are taught in schools the good
old AIT. It was posted by Vidyanath Rao:

What is the current consesus on the time scale attached to the AMT/ or its
variants?

It may be of interest to know that "Horse" does not show up in Mesopotamia
until about 1700  or 1800 BCE. When it does appear it is referred to as the
"ass of the eastern mountains".

AfghAnistan is of course, azvasthAna.
