Dear members of the list,

I am looking for references to works on comparative aspects of Hindi (or
Urdu) grammar or syntax with that of Panjabi.

I have the references to Vidya Bhaskar Arun's work on comparative phonology
of Hindi and Panjabi, and Devi Dutt Shama's work on the syllabic structure
of Hindi and Panjabi.

Thank you for your help,

With best wishes,

Ruth Schmidt
