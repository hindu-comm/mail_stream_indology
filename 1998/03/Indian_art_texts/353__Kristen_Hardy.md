Dear list members,

        I am in search of the following:

        1. English translations of any of the principal Shilpa-shaastras
(e.g., Maanasaara, Mayamata, etc.)

        2. Secondary sources discussing the creation of (Indian) art as a form
of religious practice/discipline.

        Any references which list members can provide would be much
appreciated.
                                                Thanks,

                                                Kristen Hardy,
                                                student of Religion and
