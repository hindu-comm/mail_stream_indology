>Dear list members,

>        I am in search of the following:
>
>        1. English translations of any of the principal Shilpa-shaastras
>(e.g., Maanasaara, Mayamata, etc.)

Consider the following textx from Sitaram Bhartia Institute of Scientific
Research, 1101, New Delhi House, 27, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi  110001:

(a)  MAYAMATA, trans. by Bruno Dagens. 1985.

(b)  ARCHITECTURE IN THE AJITAGAMA AND IN THE RAURAVAGAMA (1984)

(c)  BIBLIOGRAPHY OF WORKS ON VASTUSASTRA (1986)
>
>        2. Secondary sources discussing the creation of (Indian) art as a form
>of religious practice/discipline.

(a)  Still the best text is Stella Kramrisch.  THE HINDU TEMPLE. 2 vols.
Originally U. of Calcutta, now reprinted by Motilal Banarsidass.  Also, as I
had one of my art and architecture students do recently: a boolean search on
First Search using combinations such as architecture and India, temples and
India, festivals and temples, and word and/or subject searches such as
vastupurusa, vastushastra (vastusastra), etc.
