McAlpin published his provocative and very interesting study quite some
time ago and then he himself (if I am not mistaken) appears to have
disappeared from academic cirlces and nothing more was heard from him. In
any event, while some linguists are still open to considering his line of
argument, it is by no means universally accepted at all. Does anyone know
of any more recent work predicated on McAlpin's preliminary
investigations?  Regrards, Edwin
