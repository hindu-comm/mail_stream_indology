Are there any good references available for the Bangani language of
Himachal Pradesh ?. What branch of IE languages is Bangani ?
Will really appreciate any info.
What about the Tocharian language ?

This whole stretch  from Tajikistan & Western China down to the Gujarat coast,
is truly fascinating with languages like Tocharian, Bangani and Brahui exploding
myths about language & ethnicity.
