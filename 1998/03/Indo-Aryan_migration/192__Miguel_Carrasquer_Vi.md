Leaving lurk-mode...  What's wrong with the much simpler one: Avestan
<aSti-> "width of four fingers" (IE *ok^t-is, *ok^t-os "4" => du.
*ok^toH "8")?

If the IE laryngeals h1, h2, h3 were analogous to the velar series k^,
k, kw (i.e. they were phonetically palatal /x^/, plain /x/ and
labialized /xw/), then reconstructing a dual form *ok^toh3 (/ok^toxw/)
would explain all these forms (the Sanskrit dual with -u, Gothic
ahtau, Greek *ogdowos "8th", and Latin Octa:vius < *oktoh2wi- <
*ok^toh3i- [=*ok^toxwi-]).
