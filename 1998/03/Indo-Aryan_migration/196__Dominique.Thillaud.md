        Sure, considering the facts, you're perhaps right. My reserves are
just methodological ones. *kwetwores "4" and *oktoH(u) "8" are broadely
attested in Eurindian languages and satisfy easily the "3-families rule".
        That's not the case for the Anatolian *mew- (how to be sure that's
an Eurindian word?) nor for the Iranian aSti- and we are in a worse case
introducing the Proto-Kartvelian.
        I don't reject definitely an *okt- "4" but I don't consider proved
his presence in the Eurindian family. May be Not- or Pre-Eurindian and we
are perhaps here in the Nostratic domain where I am uncompetant ;)
        It's a fact that the internal analysis of number's names is
difficult - even the common rapprochment between five and the fist is not
so easy - and we are probably farther than our knowledge scope ...
        On an other way, I like to dream, I'm over-curious and I find your
hypothesis very interesting and satisfying for an open spirit. I hope
sincerely you can prove it some day and, if I'm dubious, that's just my
schizoid comportment between intuition and demonstration ;)
