Only if you are being sloppy. If that is what they meant, why not
simply say ``IA speakers became dominant''?

The question is what are these sources from where Cavalli-Sforza et al
get their information. Relying on limited or outdated sources is very
common on non-specialists.

That is why I react the way I do to `take-over of power'. It is
the kind of thing that used to be bandied about, and is still very
common when the debates occurs in political contexts among Indians.
The lurid view of IA speakers riding chariots killing or ensalving
the proto-Dravidians and forcing them to speak IA is more common
than you may think.

Such reliance affects Mallory too. His chronology of Gandhara Grave
Complex vis-avis IVC does not fit new dating. and when he confidently
asserts that `anaa' means `a-naas', ignoring an-aas, I decide that
``oh, no, not another one of those''.
