I read a quote by Rammohun Roy:

"The Sanskrit language, so difficult that almost a lifetime is
necessary for its acquisition, is well known to have been for ages a
lamantable check to the diffusion of knowledge. And, the learning
concealed under this almost impervious veil is far from sufficient to
reward the labour of acquiring it".

Where does Rammohun Roy say this?
