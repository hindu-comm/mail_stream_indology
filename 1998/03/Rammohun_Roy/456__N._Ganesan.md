Thank you, Dr. Killingley. After seeing Prof. Deshpande
mention your paper on retroflexes in sanskrit for
the 1966 Kualalumpur tamil conference, I thought of
posting this important remark by R. Roy.

Thaninayaga Adigal organized this conference.
Fr. Xavier S. Thaninayagam mentions in several places
some North Dravidian languages not described till date.
I posted a query on North Dravidian in Indology.
No answers were forthcoming, as is to be expected.
As there are not too many specializing in Dravidian studies.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
