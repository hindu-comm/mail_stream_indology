Have heard that Rig Veda has racial references.
What are the verse numbers?

Any papers/published references?
>â€‰From hindutva/neohindu/marxist/IE-comparative/
dravidian/dalit/or_whatever angles.

In these kind of things, my tendency is to believe what people
who got PhDs in the study of classical India say.

Thanks.

Eager to hear,
N. Ganesan
