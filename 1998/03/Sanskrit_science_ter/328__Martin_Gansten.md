Dear list members,

In the context of measuring subtle divisions of time, the 17th century text
Horaaratna refers to various instruments, using the phrase
"yantra-turya-dhruva-bhramaadi-vicitra-yantra". Would anyone out there
happen to know the proper English terms for these instruments?

Best regards,
Martin Gansten
