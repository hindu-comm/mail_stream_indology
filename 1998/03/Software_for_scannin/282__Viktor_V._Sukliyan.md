Does anybody out there know about availibility of software for
OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION (OCR) of Indian fonts(Devanagari,
Bengali etc) for purpose of scanning Indian texts with further
conversion them in text files?
It is known that we have this facility for european languages.
What about Indian languages?

With best regards
Viktor Sukliyan.
