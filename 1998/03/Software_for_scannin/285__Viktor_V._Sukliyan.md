I don't think it's practically possible. It won't be possible for robot to
tetermine accoustical difference appearing in pronounciation
of different speakers, say from Bengal (can't pronounce such consonants
as v, ya), Punjab (instead of krishna-krishan, dharma-dharam etc),Tamils
(I suspect some difficulties with ka, kha, ga, gha, as it was mention on
Indology previously ), English speakers are in more difficulties with
their specific phonetic system situated very far away from that of Sanskrit.
Secondly voice recognition is not so universal as optical one where you
 need not to have phonology experts qualified to read and speak.
