I'd like to point out two facts:

1. The shankaracarya's have _not_ wanted to ban conversion (not sure
about the present Kanchi head).

2. In the Khilafat case, the British prosecuted the Sha.nkaracarya of
Puri, which was very embarrassing for them since an acknowledged Hindu
leader was supporting the muslims.

I very firmly agree that lower castes were suppressed and also
missionary activity was benefecial, but let's not get carried away by
political rhetoric of DK politicians.

Rama.

PS: It was Narayana guru et al, who helped Kerala's renaissance not
Christian missionaries!
