statements that _he_ is 'important', 'relevant', 'admired', etc. etc. are
without scholarly significance.

But, is this really a valid parameter?  Does the importance of Christianity
depend on how well Christians know the Bible?  Or is it the myth around
Jesus (and the saints) that 'catches people's imagination'?
