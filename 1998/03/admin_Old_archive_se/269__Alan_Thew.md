[Archive link](https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/1998-March/011314.html)

The new software and archives have been up and running now since
September of last year.

The server that used to host the archives for gopher and web access
will be shortly shut down although a minimal version will continue to
give pointers to the new server for sometime. Unfortunately several of
the web indexers still list the old data (I have mailed Excite about
this today). There will be no gopher access after the shutdown. If
people complain to your list that data is not available, please point
them to the URL:

Thanks.
