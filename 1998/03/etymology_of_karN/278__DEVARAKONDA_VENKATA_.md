In Telugu

kaNiti (kaMti) = tumour, kaNupu or kanupu = joints of bamboo or reed
(protuberance)

kaMta, kannamu = hole; kaMtalu = h0les

kannu = eye, kannulu (kaLLu) = eyes, kaNatalu = depressed areas on the
sides of the forehead. (Perhaps because of the hole or depression in
the skull in these places)

Te. gaMtamu or ghaMtamu for stylus (Sk. kaNTaka , Te. kaMTamu = thorn)
may also be related to kan (to pierce).

regards,

sarma.
