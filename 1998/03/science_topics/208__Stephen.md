As a Trigonometry student in India the first thing I learnt was that
Ramanujam, in his short life, was a major contributor to Trig. In the West
though I never see his name mentioned anywhere in most Trigonometry books. I
have come across a biography or two, but nothing else - very rarely would a
person read the biography if he did not know who Ramanujam was or what his
contributions were.  Is this an oversight or did someone else take credit
for his work?
