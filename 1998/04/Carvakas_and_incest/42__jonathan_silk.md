A friend told me a few days ago that according to his memory Tibetan
Siddhanta (grub mtha') texts say that the Carvakas system was devised to
account for the fact that the founder of the system was (this was not quite
clear to me) a product of incest/a participant in incest with his own
mother. Are there Indic sources for such a legend? (I don't even have an
exact Tibetan source, and have no materials at hand to check in.)

(I am not particularly interested in the Carvakas per se -- but rather in
the incest part of the whole thing.)

Many thanks for any hints!
