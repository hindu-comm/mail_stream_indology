        Until today, cArvAka was just for me the false brahman of the MBh
and I'm astonished to learn that a philosoph had choosed a so evil name!
        What link between the mythical and actual character? There is a
possibility that the legends about the last could be influenced by the ones
about the first? I don't remember incest in the rakSasa's story but better
specialists of the MBh have perhaps something to say ...
