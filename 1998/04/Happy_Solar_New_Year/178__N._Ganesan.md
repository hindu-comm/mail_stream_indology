April 14, 1998

Happy Solar New Year
********************

Tamil, Malayalam, Punjab, Bengal, Sinhala, Thai, Khmer people
celebrate New Year almost on the same date of Western calender,
because they follow Solar calender.

Tamil New Year occurs on 14th April mostly, once in a few years
it happens on 13th April. This is related to Leap year of
Gregorian calender.

Read in a newspaper that Japan celebrates its New year on
14 April 1998. Does Japan follow Solar calender for
New year computations? What other people follow Solar
calender in India or elsewhere?

Happy New Year,
N. Ganesan
