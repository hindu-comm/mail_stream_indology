Interesting work by Bruce Williams of the Oriental Institute suggests
that most of the earliest evidence of writing in ancient Egypt was
also found on pots and jars.  Maybe pottery should be considered the
first sign of "civilization."  With the exception of the tool-maker,
the potter seems to be one of the first craftspersons. Pottery seems
also the oldest manufactured trade item, with the possible exception of beads.
Most likely the trade of grain, one of the real signs of the
development of urban life, involved pottery as shipping containers.

And, of course, in many cultures, the first signs of writing are
found on potsherds.
