I tried to email Ms Pernstich according to the email address on this
Indology post, and it bounced back. Something wrong with the email
address. Would Ms Pernstich please fix this? She could email me if she
likes.

Could anyone who knows please tell me more about this?  Origin/meaning
of the custom, maybe some text references, and especially where it
was/still is practiced.  Trying to write a thing on different aspects of
prostitution in India.

Thanks
