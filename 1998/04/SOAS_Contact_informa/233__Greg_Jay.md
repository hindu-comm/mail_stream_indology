Why not directly contact the Vrndavan Research Institute, Chatikara Rd,
Vrndavan, Mathura Dist, U.P., India. Make your enquiries care of the
Director or Mr. Gosh the reader, or Mr. Pulin Krsna Goswami or Puneet
Goswami the persons in the Microfilm department. I worked with them back in
the mid 80's on a Microfilm project. I don't know who to contact in England.
