I would like to announce the following University of Chicago summer course
offering:

        Introductory Sanskrit 1,2,3 (South Asian Languages and
Civilizations 250, 251, 252).

        9:00am-1:00pm, MWF (June 22-August 28).  Instructor: L. McCrea,
Lecturer, Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations.

        This course sequence fulfills the Common Core language requirement.
The first half of the course sequence is spent mastering the reading and
writing of Devanagari script and studying the grammar of the classical
Sanskrit language.  The remainder of the course sequence is devoted to
close analytical reading of simple Sanskrit texts, which are used to
reinforce the grammatical study done in the first half of the course.  The
aim is to bring students to the point where they are comfortably able, with
the help of a dictionary, to read simple, narrative Sanskrit.

        Those interested in taking the course should contact:
