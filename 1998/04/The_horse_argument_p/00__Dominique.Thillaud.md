        You say here more than I do. Horse's bones and chariots were found
in Mycenian digs. But their number was fewer than expected by a simple
reading of epics. The remains show a great importance of the horse as a
prestige animal, but we don't have prooves of an actual use of chariots in
the warfare.
        Nothing else. Regards,
Dominique
