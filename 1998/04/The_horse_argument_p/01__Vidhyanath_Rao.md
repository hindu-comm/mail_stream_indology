I apologize for misinterpreting what you wrote.

My understanding is that how chariots were used is not clear.
Homer writes as if chariots were simply transportation (a classicist
friend of mine called it `glorified taxis'). It is not practical to
joust from chariots as some people assume. Chariots can serve as
mobile missile firing platforms, and vedic texts do suggest such an
use. So we might expect more evidence for horses and chariots from
sites associated to Indo-Aryans than in Mycenean sites. But it seems
that the reverse is the case.
