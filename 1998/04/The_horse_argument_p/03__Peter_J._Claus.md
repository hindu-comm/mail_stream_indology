Ah, and one of my India teachers pointed out how taxis (actually it was
those Official cars with the erect, sheathed thing on the hood) in India
are used like chariots! But that was in the old days (15 yrs ago), when
having a government job MEANT something, and being driven through the
crowded streets, arriving a place, etc. in one of these things
distinguished the passenger. Like a being in charriot.
