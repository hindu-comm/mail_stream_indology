No, I do not think this would be a correct conclusion. There are several
passages where the poets seem to identify themselves with the Aryas, and -
on the other hand - others where their party fights both against
dAsas/dasyus and Aryas. It seems reasonable to me to keep to the
traditional explanation that Aryan tribes often fought against each other.

Best regards,
               Georg v. Simson
