The greatest yogi in Tamil literature is Tirumuular.

Let me quote from K. Zvelebil, The poets of the powers,
"The yogin, poet and philosopher Tirumuular might have lived
some time in the 7th century A.D. since he is mentioned by
Cuntarar in tiruttoNTattokai (The Anthology about the
Lives of the Slave-Saints', late 7th century-early 8th century),
st. 5 (7621). Umaapati Civaacaaryar (14th century) clearly refers
to Tirumuulara as a Siddha".

In other works, KZ dates him at 6th century.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
