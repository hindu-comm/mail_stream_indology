 Indologists,

Can anyone help me to contact

1) Monika Thiel-Horsmann (she has changed her name now, but I don't know
the new one).

2) Someone from SOAS who knows something about the microfilming of temple
records from Brindavan.

I am looking for a name, a telephone number, mailing address, and/ or an
e-mail address.....

merci d'avance,
Adrian Burton
