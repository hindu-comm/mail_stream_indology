Greetings list-members,

        An associate of mine (who is not on the Indology-list) is looking for
information on the topic of 'female saints' in Hinduism (including
biographies, etc. on particular individuals) for a course she is teaching. I
realise this is a very broad topic, but any references which list-members can
provide will be of help. (Please feel free to e-mail me privately, and I will
pass them on to her.)

        Thanks very much,

        Kristen Hardy,
        umhardy at cc.umanitoba.ca
