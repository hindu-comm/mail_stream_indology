Hm... Would it be tactless to remind the readers of the fact that the
Christian religion is based on one case of human sacrifice, that is, the
sacrifice of the son of God by God? Although the sacrifice of human beings
is strictly forbidden by Christianity, it still got started (theologically
at least) with something that can only be described as a human sacrifice.
