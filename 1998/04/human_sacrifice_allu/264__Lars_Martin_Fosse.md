>The passage from Leviticus forbids sacrifice to a rival god. Although
>the references are often oblique, the Hebrew Bible implies Yahweh's
>acceptance of, or need for human sacrifice. In the story of Jephthah and
>the oblation of his un-named daughter (Judges 11: 30-40), Jephthah
>promised God that he would sacrifice the first person to greet him upon
>return from battle. He sealed his military victory against the Ammonites
>by slitting his daughter's throat and offering her life to Yahweh.

A somewhat similar motive is known in Greek legend, where Idomeneus
(returning from Troy) promises to sacrifice the first person he meets on the
beach after a ship-wreck to Neptun. The person turns out to be his son.
Mozart has made a wonderful opera on the basis of this theme (Idomeneo,
third act particularly recommended).
