I am sorry I intervened in the Fezas-Fosse debate about the death penalty
and human sacrifice.  I did not intend to "make an argument" for the death
penalty, but only to suggest that, in addition to deterrence and social
control issues, many would justify the DP on retributivist grounds.  (I
doubt that the DP can be justified on deterrence or social control grounds.)
I do think that there is something to be said for the retributive theory of
punishment.  Is that approach so scantily supported in Indian thought as to
be beneath contempt and to place retributivists in a category that DESERVES
NO consideration?  I wouldn't say that I DESERVE an answer from Fezas, but I
would say that I do not deserve a slap.
