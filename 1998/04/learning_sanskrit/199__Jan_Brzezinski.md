Dear Margo,

You might be interested in the publications and cassettes put out by the American Sanskrit Institute. Vyas Houston is the rather well-known director of this school and he often gives seminars and intensives. You can look at the February 1996 edition of the Yoga Journal for a personal account of how he does his Yoga Sutra intensives. I have used his Yoga Sutra handbook for teaching purposes and think it useful.

Jan Brzezinski
