I want to set one record straight. The teacher of rAmaswAmi dIkSitar
in vocal music is the tanjAvur AsthAna vidvAn vIrbhadrayya, a telugu
man. rAmasvAmi dIkSitar learnt upto AlApana and pallavi svaras from him.
This fact is usally underplayed in taking about the musical tradition
of muddusvAmi dIkSitar.

>â€‰From the descendents of vEnkaTamakhi, rAmasvAmi dIkSitar learnt
musicology (chaturdanDi prakAzika) and vINa.

subbarAma dIkSitar in SSP says of vIrabhadrayya

"It is because of this great man that the southern musical tradition
is shining with great clarity till today."

regards,

sarma.
