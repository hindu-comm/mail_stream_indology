Dr. Claus,

In a message dated 98-05-23 13:41:54 EDT, you write:

<< Yes, they are (ARE, in coastal Karnataka, at least, where there are many
 active Jain temples [basadi]) called Indras. >>

It is not clear for me if you mean these Indras are priests or administrators?
Can you clarify? Thanks.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
