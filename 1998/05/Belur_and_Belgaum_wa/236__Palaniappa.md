In a message dated 98-05-09 16:41:58 EDT, you write:

<< .i.e. basavEzvara uses "kUDala sangamEzvara!" >>

Is this "kUDala sangamEzvara" not a Dravidian/IA hybrid  type you were talking
about in the thread on Belur/Belgaum? To me kUDala sangama also seems to be a
hybrid composed of words meaning the same but of two different linguistic
lineages. I would like to know the accepted interpretation of this name.
Thanks.
