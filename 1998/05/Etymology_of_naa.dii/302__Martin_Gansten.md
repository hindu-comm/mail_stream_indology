I recently saw a Nadi (naa.dii) astrologer of Tamil Nadu quoted as saying,
"The very word 'Nadi' in Tamil means (destined) to come on own accord." As a
Tamil-illiterate Sanskritist, I would be greatful for any comments from
Tamil scholars on this list as to whether there is any substance to this
etymology.

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
