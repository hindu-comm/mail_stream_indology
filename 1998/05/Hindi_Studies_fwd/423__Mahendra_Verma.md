Dear Raj

I can't think of any university / college in the UK where there is
facility for a distance-learning programme in Hindi. The only place
which does offer such a programme is The Hindi Directorate,Ministry of
Education, Government of India, New Delhi. You should write to the Hindi
Officer, The Indian High Commission, Aldwych,London for more details.
