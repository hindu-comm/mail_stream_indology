Well, Dominique. On a spring day, Siva and Parvati
could not overcome passion. They transform themselves
to elephants. Ganesha is born as a result, so says
Sambandhar (fl. 642 AD).

This origin myth of Ganesa is different from the majority
of tamil/sanskrit stories on Ganesa's birth. You must
hear this tEvaaram sung by an Otuvaar in a "siva
temple to realize the power.

       piTi atan2 uru umai koLa miku kari atu
       vaTikoTu tan2atu aTi vazipaTumavar iTar
       kaTi kaNapati vara aruLin2an2 miku koTai
       vaTivin2ar payil valivalam uRai iRaiyE.

gajAnana sevaka,
N. Ganesan
