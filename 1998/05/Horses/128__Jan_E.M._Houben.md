Recent contributions to this thread (most recently the one by N.Ganesan)
contain sufficient references to show that horses were of considerable
importance in IE.

The question of relative chronology comes up here. In the Ukraine evidence for
domesticated horses is found going back to more than 4000 B.C.  When was the
domesticated horse introduced in Japan? Wasn't horse-culture in China strongly
associated with "western people"? Semitic cultures may have made important
contributions of their own to horse-breeding, charioteering, etc., but when?
Here we have to cross the boundaries of Indology, I cannot give anything like a
definitive answer, only pose the questions . . .

migration of IE peoples.

It is not simple matter of presence, but a matter of former well-documented
absence and subsequent well-documented presence. The idea of mass-migrations
has already been largely given up, as far as I know. This is replaced by micro-
migrations and language and culture shifts, transitory phases of bilingualism
etc.

Domesticating a chicken is not so much dependent on technique and long-term
planning as domesticating, breeding, employing and taking care of horses . . .
A main-frame computer system (say) is quickly sold, but needs follow up care by
the producing company for years . . .
