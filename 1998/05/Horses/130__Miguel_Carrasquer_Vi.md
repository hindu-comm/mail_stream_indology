Do these "modern Iranians" include the Ossetes, the Yaghnobi or the
Tajiks?

Modern Turks of Turkey speak an Altaic language, yet "biologically"
they are similar to ancient Anatolian populations speaking
Indo-European (Anatolian, Phrygian, Greek) languages.  I hear nobody
claiming that the Hittites were Altaic...

The evidence is not fragmentary.  The Iranian languages (Khwarezmian,
Khotanese etc.) are unique to the steppe-zone, constituting a
separate Eastern branch of Iranian, represented today by Ossetic
[modern Scytho-Sarmatian], Yaghnobi [modern Sogdian] and Pashto and
the Pamir languages [modern Bactrian].  They are quite unlike the
Western Iranian languages [Farsi, Kurdish, Baluchi].  Arabic writings
in Indonesia and China are just standard Arabic and indeed mean
nothing, linguistically.

What is an "Altaic archaeological culture"?  What evidence in which
local languages?  Why are all the ancient loanwords in Finno-Ugrian
from Iranian or Tocharian, not Altaic?  How do you explain Tocharian
in the Tarim basin?
