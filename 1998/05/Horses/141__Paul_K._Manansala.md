Sorry, I can't resist.  Linguistics tells us absolutely nothing about
the biological relations of the steppe population.

Yes, and those Scythians were blondies I suppose.

Hippocrates describes Scythians as short and stocky with legs shorter
than the trunk.  He states thay had little facial or body hair, and
that their features were not well-defined like Europeans.  He calls
this "humidity of features."  Basically this agrees with the remains
found in the Scythian burials.  They were physically not different than
the Hsiung-nu or from modern Mongols or Uighurs.
