I'm aware of the last article, and the analysis of the author is
simply Kennewick-style mishmash.  For those unfamiliar with
Kennewick, it involves claims by certain anthropologists that crania
found in the Northwest U.S. are "Pre-Caucasoid." The arguments they
use are easily refuted.  For example, Chatters suggests that the
Sundadont dental type of Kennewick Man is suggestive of ancient
Caucasoid. However, any familiar with the topic knows that the term
"Sundadont" was originally constructed to describe Southern Mongoloid
dentition.  You find other scholars also using this Sundadont pattern
now to suggest ancient Siberians were "Pre-Caucasoid."

He is referring only to "typical Mongoloid" features, and even here
he is incorrect.  The skulls do show features like prognathism and
broad nasal bones which are "Mongoloid" characteristics

Not really.  The suggestion is that they show "Primitive Caucasoid"
characteristics.  For example, a steep mandible is somehow mentioned
as a "Caucasoid" characteristic.  However, steep mandibles hardly a
modern typical feature of Caucasoids.  They are very common among
some contemporary and modern Southeast Asian/Pacific populations.
Another error is claiming palatine torus is a "Caucasoid"
characteristic.  The highest rates of palatine torus occur among
Eskimos and Polynesians.

There are about 100 mummies and many other remains.  There is also
abundant genetic evidence that modern and ancient residents of
Xinkiang are closely related to East Asian types.   Here are a few to
look over:

However, I need  to warn that there are many problems with bias in genetic studies
There is a distinct racial element in all these studies that cannot
be ignored.  The roots are old and more submerged now, but they still
certainly exist. The Kennewick conflict is just one very prominent
sign of this problem.

I've pasted two abstracts relating to Sundadonty and palatine torus
that will clear us some of these mispresentations of "Caucasoid"
traits.

|        TITLE:  Dental variation among four prehispanic Mexican populations.

 ABSTRACT:       In this paper, the dental morphology of prehispanic Meso-
|                american populations is described, compared, and examined
|                within the context of New World dental variation. Twenty-
|                eight morphological dental traits were studied and compared
|                in four samples of prehispanic Mexican populations. After
|                eliminating intra- and interobserver error, the dental
|                morphological characteristics observed show evidence of
|                heterogeneity among the populations. In particular, the
|                oldest population, Tlatilco (1300-800 BC), was significantly
|                different from the other three groups, Cuicuilco (800-100
|                BC), Monte Alban (500 BC-700 AD) and Cholula (550-750 AD).
|                When the four samples were compared to other Mongoloid
|                populations, either univariately or multivariately, it was
|                observed that the Mexican groups did not follow a strict
|                Sinodont (characteristic of Northeast Asia)/Sundadont
|                (characteristic of Southeast Asia) classification (Turner
|                [1979] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 51:619-636). From the traits
|                examined, 27% presented frequencies consistent with Sinodont
                 variation, while 73% of the traits showed similar incidence
|                to Southeast Asian groups. Multivariately, the Mexican
|                populations were found to fit an overall Sundadont
|                classification. These results indicate that there is more
|                dental morphological variation among American Indian
|                populations than previously shown.

|       SOURCE:  Community Dent Oral Epidemiol (DNF), 1988 Feb; 16 (1): 61-4

|     ABSTRACT:  Torus palatinus (TP) was recorded in 13.5% of 1317 German
|                patients (606 men, 711 women). There was no statistically
|                significant difference between the sexes. Torus palatinus
|                was found in 23.1% of 947 Thai (404 men, 543 women). The
|                difference between the sexes was significant (P less than
|                0.001); women were affected in 28.5%, men showed a TP in
|                15.8%. The differences in prevalence rates between Germans
|                and Thai was also statistically significant (P less
|                0.001). Torus mandibularis (TM) was recorded in 5.2% of the
|                German patients with 8.6% of the men and 2.4% of the women
|                being affected (P less than 0.001). In the Thai, 9.4% of the
|                men and 9% of the women showed TM. The difference between
|                the prevalence rates in Germans and Thai was significant (P
|                less than 0.001). While generally milder forms of tori were
|                observed in German patients, marked forms of TM were also
|                seen in this group. While the etiology of TP and TM is still
|                no quite clear, racial factors must definitely be
                considered.
