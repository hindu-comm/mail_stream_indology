While the *absence* of domesticated horse can be construed as a
strong indication that the culture was not Aryan (given the word
aZva), it does not work the other way: the *presence* of domesticated
horse in itself proves nothing.  Even if we ascribe the domestication
of the horse to Indo-Europeans (and there can be little doubt IMHO
that the Srednij Stog culture *was* IE-speaking), there was nothing
to stop linguistically non-IE groups to adopt the horse as a
domesticate (we know the Sumerians, Akadians, Hurrians and Egyptians
did).
