I am curious to know how the following fits in this theory.

The verb cei (do)

In Tamil Nadu you hear this word pronounced both as "sei" and "cei".
According to the above theory (if I understand it correctly), people who
have some sort of Sanskrit background would pronounce it as "sei". If this
is so, what is the explanation for the same verb occuring in the -c- form in
Malayalam, a language "supposedly" developed by the Namboodhris who of
course had a strong Sanskrit background. E.g. in Malayalam - Avan ceidhu (he
did).



P.S. I do not know the Tamil/English transliteration scheme, so may not have
spelt the words correctly.
