There was a suggestion that kuuDala is the place name and
sangamesvara refers to the God's name.

kuuDala samngama is a place name. How do we know this?
There were two Chola era prabandhams of war, now lost except
for a few verses and their names occur in medieval commentaries.
The 10th century paraNi prabandhams are called
1) koppattup paraNi and 2) kuuDala sangamattup paraNi.

Hence, koppam and kuuDala sangamam will refer to place names.
AND, kuuDala sangamam is hybrid name.
This may very well be the case of BelgAm too.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
