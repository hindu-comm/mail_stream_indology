Re: the dAsakUTa, let me clarify that kanakadAsa's connection to Udupi
is simply because Udupi is the center of the mAdhva sampradAya. And even
here, legend has it that he was not allowed inside the temple because he
was not a brAhmaNa. Certainly, mAdhvas are allowed to express special
devotion to vishNu at places other than Udupi. The specific connection
of the chosen God to a place seems equally important in the signatures
of both vIraSaiva and dAsakUTa poets, notwithstanding other metaphysical
differences.
