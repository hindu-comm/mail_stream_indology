Alas: behold the result, on the one hand, of excessive modesty on the part of Kannada people in publicising their treasures, and, on the other hand, of limited inquisitiveness to date in the scholarly community. -- Practically every vacana that has been found has been published. The Directorate of Kannada and Culture, Bangalore, has brought out all the known early vacanas in 15 hardbound volumes a few years ago, under the general editorship of Prof. Dr. M.M. Kalaburgi of Dharwad. Small publishers, mainly in northern Karnataka, have brought out many editions of the writings of individual vacanakaaras. (As for where to get them: please wait another few weeks. I happen to have here _Ambiga Cau.dayyana vacanaga.lu_, ed. B.R. Surapura [Dharwad: Hejjeenu prakaa;sana, 1980], containing 177 vacanas. I believe Prof. Dr. L. Basavaraju of Mysore has brought out Deevara Daasimayya's vacanas, but I'll have to check.)

This apparently happened at a later stage in his life. But his relationship with Udupi is simply that U. was the centre of Madhvaacaarya's activities and has since remained the centre of the Dvaitin tradition, and not that Kanakadaasa was born there, or had family relations there, etc.

 mC> Were his parents zrIvaiSNava?

This is the common assumption.

 mC> Was there a lot of zrIvaiSNava activity at any point of time

I would say none at all; or if there had been any, then all traces have been obliterated by the Vaishnavism of Madhva.

This seems correct.

Correct.

Multiple deities, or manifestations of one deity? This brings up the complex issue of "little traditions" vs. inclusivistic "great traditions", but also the religio-psychological (drat, how does one say this in English? I want to say: "religionspsychologische") question of localisation of the divine and how the devotee relates to the divinity in its local(ised) form. If Kaaginele Kee;sava and Vi.t.thala of Pandharpur are to be thought of as 'multiple deities' of the Maadhvas, one could argue that the same ought to be true of, e.g., Kuu.dalasa:ngamadeeva and Guhee;svara among the Virasaivas. Theologically (on a 'great tradition' level), neither group would agree with such an interpretation. Siva is one. Maadhva theologians have apparently tried to accommodate local traditions more explicitly (cf. Madhva's verse: "arcitaas sarvadevaas syur yatas sarvagato Hari.h" in his K.r.s.naam.rtamahaar.nava), but here there are gods and gods, and the only two eternal gods are the coexistent!
 Hari and Lak.smii.

Literarily, we can speak of a 'stylistic' difference; but why should it be there in the first place? In Virasaivism, the devotee ultimately realises his / her essential unity with Siva, whereas in Dvaita such a notion is considered perditious hybris, and individuality never ceases to be. Thus in the theology of the daasas an explicit placing in the foreground of the individual and a stressing of the daasa's personal relationship with God (_Purandaradaasa's_ Vi.t.thala, etc.) makes sense (in view of religious polemics of the time), whereas in Virasaivism individuality, which is worldly, is played down. But I can agree with Vidyasankar Sundaresan to the extent that this difference between the a:nkitas of the ;sara.nas and the daasas is not absolute.

We should perhaps also note that Kannada scholars agree that the use of such signatures as a literary device among the daasas has been borrowed from the Virasaiva ;sara.nas. If the ;sara.nas had never had such a usage, then the daasas might never have developed it.
