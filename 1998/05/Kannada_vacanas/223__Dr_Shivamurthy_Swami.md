I do see some point in what Robert Zydenbos wrote.  As I understand him what he means is that the words "ii;svara" and "deeva" convey the same meaning, but when we refer to the ankita (signature) of the Vacanas of BasavaNNa, it is "kuu.dalasa:ngamadeeva" only and not "kuu.dalasa:ngamee;svara".   In quite a number of Vacanas, BasavaNNa uses also the word "kuu.dalasa:nga" as his ankita.  

The name of the deity at Kudala Sangama is "saMgamEswara".  The words "saMgamEswara" and " SaMga" are of course synonymous and refer to the same deity. But it is not the case with the word "saMgama".  The word "saMgama" is always used with reference to a place (confluence) and not for referring to any deity.  However, the use of the word in conjunction with other words like "saMgama-nAtha" referring to the deity can be found in the Kannada Vacana literature

<<I fail to see the point you are making here. Of course I appreciate
 your eye for the details. But unless you want to claim
"saMgamEswara" , "saMgama" and " SaMga" are different dieties
(and any such claim cannot be maintained ) I fail to see what
difference it makes>>
