Cf., e.g., Majjhimanikaaya I.38.20-30 (PTS ed.):

The relevant passage has to be translated: "... he pervades the whole
world with a heart (cetasaa) that is connected with friendship
(etc.), that [= the heart] is extensive (or wide, vipula),
enlarged (or great, mahaggata), immeasurable (appamaa.na), without
hostility (avera), invulnerable (abyaabajjha)."
