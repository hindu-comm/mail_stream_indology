Vidyasankar said:

"...Such practices are not restricted to specific doctrinal affiliations, and as
far as the daSanAmI orders and the mAdhva orders are concerned, there
is also no pollution for the erstwhile family and relatives of the sannyAsin."

But this would be for another reason than that a sannyasin's death does
not create impurity.  It would be because with respect to his natal family he
became dead at sannyasa.
