Dear Fritz

> They look like beaded conch shells to me.

Perhaps from far they might!  But, if you look
at a close-up photo from Carl Johannessen's
pages at University of Oregon, they don't look
like conch shells at all! ...beaded or othewise.

I do think though, that they look a lot like
custard apples!
