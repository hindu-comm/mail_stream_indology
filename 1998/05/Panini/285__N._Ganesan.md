"Siva occurs much before 6th century CE in tamil.
What you see in tamil is a mature, elaborate bhakti
texts on "Siva from 5th century onwards.
(eg., Cilappatikaaram, Karaikkaal Ammai are dated by many
scholars in 5th century CE. They have copiuos references to "Siva)

For Mayentiram, a tamilized form of Mahendra appearing
in Cambodia, see my post last month. It is recorded in
China in 484 AD.

For references on "Siva from classical sangam texts (200bc - 200ad),
I will compile & post for you after some time.

BTW, kantapurANam in 12th century CE is written by
kacciyappa civAccAriyAr, an adhisaiva priest. From adhisaiva homes,
the major saivagamas were found.
