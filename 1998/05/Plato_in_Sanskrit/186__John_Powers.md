Dear Wayne:

I saw your posting on Indology, and was wondering if you're the same guy
who was a t McMaster. If so, hi.

Hope you're doing well. As you can see from the return address, I'm now at
Australian National University, where I teach courses on Buddhism, Modern
India, and lots of other things.

Cheers,

John Powers
