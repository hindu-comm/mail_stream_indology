Hello,

There is a proposal to change the glyphs of three conjunct characters in
the Devanagari Metafont designed by Frans Velthuis. These these glyphs are
"h+n", "h+l", and "h+v". The current and proposed glyphs, as well as
further details, are given in the file available at:

        http://weber.u.washington.edu/~apandey/dvng-chg.ps

I am requesting that users of Mr. Velthuis's package please review the
proposal and respond with comments.

Regards,
Anshuman Pandey
