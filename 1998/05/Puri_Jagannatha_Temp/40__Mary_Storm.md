Dear Indologists,

I just recently came across a 19th c. reference to relic bones in the
Jagganatha Temple in Puri, which are supposedly associated with Krsna.
Considering the pollution associated with death and the body in Hinduism
this would seem to be  highly unusual, not to say unlikely.

 Does anybody know anything about this Puri legend or any other Hindu
veneration practices of  body relics ?

Was Puri a Buddhist site at one time?

Many thanks for your thoughts on this,

Mary Storm
