Hi,
I visited the Sarasvati Mahal a year and a half ago and I do have some
literature lying around.  I will have look and see  I can send any names,
addresses and phone numbers your way.  The library is very small and
understaffed and they are quite strict about letting people view their
holdings.
I will get back  in touch with you.
