Sir Aurel Stein.  It was published recently in a volume by S.P.Gupta
called 'An Archaeological Tour Along the Ghaggar/Hakra River' (or some
such thing).  I personally find the identification with Sarasvati
convincing.  However, I don't know of any reliable and thorough efforts
made to date the various stages of the drying up of this river.  Until
this is done, her usefulness for dating the texts that mention her seems
limited.   Does Dr. Subramanya know of any authoritative dating data?
