How fascinating! Simply trust the linguists. Or, just believe the
inscriptions of the civilization on copper tablets and other media, if
only linguists can 'read' them and also explain the artha...

Were samudra and sa_gara synonyms in RV? Did the lexemes (thanks for
small mercies, there were no lexicographers then!)just connote broad
expanses of water (salty or fresh, stagnant or flowing)?

On another note, see how archaeologists can do better than the
lexicographers? Sir John Marshall uses the term 'cult object' and
every analyst thereafter gets trapped in the lead. The only 'cult'
evidence we seem to find is the emergence and stabilisation of a
bronze-age culture, apart from burnt bricks.
