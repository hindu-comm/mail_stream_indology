Why limit this debate to a river that may or may not have been mighty,
and may or may not have flown into the ocean? How about looking at the
Rgvedic sarasvatI in a more generic sense, with reference to a delta
region, with coastal lagoons and/or estuaries? Aren't these "ponds" too?
Then the reference to samudrANi would be to more saline environments,
where saras is more "fresh-water" - one "flows" into the other,
depending on tidal mechanisms. Wouldn't this also explain the sindhu as
the "mother" of the sarasvatI? Any serious evidence against such an
interpretation?
