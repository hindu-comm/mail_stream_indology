Yes, but the geographical limit of the Rgveda seems to be limited to the
area from the Himalayas to the borders of Sindh (Bhalanas ~ Bolan pass)
and from Afghanistan to the Yamuna/Ganga. No mentioning of the Indian
Ocean -- unless one wants to understand the mythological hundred-oared
ship of the  mythological figure Bhujyu (in the ocean of the night sky)
as the "ocean going ships of the Rgveda" (RV 1.116.3 sqq.)

Fine, but samudrANi "3, 4 etc. oceans"? : otherwise one would say, e.g.,
samudrau "2 oceans".

Where multiple oceans are mentioned they seem to be mythological like the
2 hindu-s of the Avesta. All in "Sur le chemin du ciel, Bulletin des
Etudes indiennes,2, Paris 1984.

typical of the RV: one can be the mother of X, and at the same time the
daughter of x. It only refers to a close connection of Sarasvati and
Sindhu (which also may be the -mythological- ocean if we compare Avestan
hendu). NB: Skt. sindhu mostly is masculine! No mother/daughter here!
