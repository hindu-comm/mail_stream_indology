Isn't it quite clear from linguistic tradition that samudra means
ocean.  Clearly it does not mean a regular lake or desert.  A very large
lake could be confused with the ocean, but do any of these rivers
empty into large lakes?

Also "north" is a very relative term.  There is a northern Indian
ocean adjacent to northern India and a southern one next to southern
India. We don't necessarily have to accept Tilak to explain the
northern samudra.

The least complex explanation for a river flowing from the mountains
to the ocean is the literal one since there are indeed such rivers in
modern and ancient India.
