I find the above statements biased.. While one could argue
that IVC is not particularly Vedic, neither is PGW. The latter was
primarily a pig and rice culture. The people were sendentary and
lived in mud huts. They made very little use of the horse, and I'm
not aware of any chariots associated with them.  They used wheel-made
pottery, associated with Asuras,  instead of the "Aryan" handmade
variety.

The work of Dilip Chakrabarti suggests that the iron used by the PGW
culture was not of foreign origin as previously thought.

Could you provide a list of the correspondences between PGW and Vedic
culture?
