The same Bhagwan Gidwani had written a historical novel titled _The
Sword of Tipu Sultan_. This was the source for a recent TV serial on
Tipu. I remember this was just not liked by the Hindutvavaadis, as Tipu
was shown as a major hero. Note the timing - Tipu Sultan novel in 1976,
TV serial in 1990-92, Aryan novel in 1994. Maybe I'm reading more into
it, but perhaps Gidwani wrote this Aryan novel just to take the heat off
his back, or to appease them.
