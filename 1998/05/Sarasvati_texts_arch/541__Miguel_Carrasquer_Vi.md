Don't forget that these words have come to us in cuneiform (syllabic)
writing.  Indra or Indara would both have been written indifferently
as IN-DA-RA, so we can infer nothing from that.  *sapta > satta is so
trivial and common a change, that not much can be concluded from it
either.  I'm not familiar with the name (?) Bardashva, but Kikkuli's
treatise contains the forms -wartanna "turn" and wasanna "horse
training area, stadium", with v- rendered as w-.  Gamq'relidze and
Ivanov in their "Indoevropejskij jazyk i indoevropejcy" conclude,
based i.a. on that word wasanna (Iranian *wazana "road") that the
Aryan layer in Mitanni is closer to Iranian than Indo-Aryan.  A
somewhat provocative conclusion, to be sure, but I'd say the
linguistical basis for considering it specifically Indo-Aryan (aika-)
is equally shaky.
