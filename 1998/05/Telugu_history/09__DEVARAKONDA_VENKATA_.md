Mr.Ganesan,

I hope you have heard the saying that "your freedom ends where
my nose begins". That puts a limit on everything. As long as you talk about
the virtues of your language without deprecating others it is OK. Again
doing this day-in and day-out is not a good strategy. But we can put up
with it.

Your intention of quoting the passage is to deprecate
Sanskrit in comparision to Tamil. However revered the commentary may be
for you and others like you, you cannot expect the list members approve of
all those things. Suppose X sends a posting quoting Y who calls Z an ass.
Then X claims that he is only quoting therefore he is blameless. Will this
be acceptable. The motive of X is obvious and he has to take the blame.

This is exactly what I said above. I have just quoted what is
prevelent in Andhra. But still you are offended. You should know
that neither I nor anybody for that matter can stop people using that
word. It will require major campaign at the Government level.

You have made a wild accusation. Please, substantiate what you have said.
The number postings about Tamil you have made and the number of times
I responded and how many times it is about Tamil.

Just look back. I would like to refresh your memory about the irrational
outburst of one of the tamil members of this list when Microsoft
announced introduction Devanagari fonts for Word. The shoe is on the other
foot.

sarma.
