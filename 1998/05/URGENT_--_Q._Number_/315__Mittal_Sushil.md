Greetings, all,

I write to ask for a tentative number of institutions in English-speaking
countries, except US, Canada, and Nez Zealand, offering introductory and
intermediate level courses on Hinduism and Religious Traditions of India.

Any information that I could get would be of immense help. Thanks.

Regards,
Sushil
