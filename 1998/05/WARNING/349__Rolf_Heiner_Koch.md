Dubious people prefer to ask scholars to write essays etc. about India, China, etc. for a friendship-forum or so - nothing they will pay you. Later on they use your writings to find internet-supportes among the industry and government to earn a lot money. you are never able to influence what they use your writings for. Be carefully.
