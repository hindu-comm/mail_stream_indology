The problem is with the term "Europoid" which I believe should be
"Europid." The term Europoid is usually used for early types like
Cro-Magnon.  "Europid" does not equate to modern "Caucasoids" even
given quite a bit of leeway for variation.  In fact, the early mummies are
quite like very old types found in East Asia.
