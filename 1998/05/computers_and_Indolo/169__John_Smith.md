It is possible much more straightforwardly if the text in question is
coded in ISCII: the software can simply switch from script to script on
demand. If you haven't yet done so, download ALP Personal from CDAC's
website and play with it: it's a reduced version of a DOS-based word
processor modeled on WordStar, and thus somewhat ancient in look and feel,
but it does a stunning job. A Sanskrit text can be displayed in
Devanagari, then converted at the touch of a key to Tamil, Telugu,
Bengali, etc., etc. Text entry is also far more rationally handled than
is the case when a word processor is simply given a Nagari font to use. I
assume (hope?) Apple's Indian Language Kit works in a similar way, but I
haven't ever seen it. CDAC's more recent Windows product, lEAP, certainly
does.
