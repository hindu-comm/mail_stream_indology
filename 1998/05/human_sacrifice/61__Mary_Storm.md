Dear Dr. Ganesan,
Any suggestions for tracking down info on the Khojas? FYI the umadevi
email address came about because my husband is a well known criminal
defense lawyer. He has been stalked by a few unsavory types, who even
managed to track him down through my maiden name at my UCLA email
address. I am not really a new age crackpot!
Many thanks for your bibliographic help.
yours,
Mary Storm
