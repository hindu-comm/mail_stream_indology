Yes, indeed. Usually, a ritual SrAddha is held before a person becomes a
sannyAsin, but the nearest male relative does have a role in the rituals
of internment of the sannyAsin's body. As for the death itself not
creating any impurity, the oldest textual source for this is the
bRhadAraNyaka passage, where the prANas of the desire-less man are said
not to depart. That is part of the reason why cremation is not done.
