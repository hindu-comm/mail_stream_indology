Hi,

The superb analysis linking archaeology, accounting,
literary texts and Tamil heritage is fascinating.

Is it clear from the Harappan artefacts that the
professions of a potter and a blacksmith were
differentiated at that time, ca. 3000 B.C.? Is
it possible that the fire-worker worked with
faience, silica, silver (there are two silver seals!)and copper plates
?(Note: he even incised on bronze implements). Is there any other
contemporaneous civilization which used copper plates to record the
conveyance of property rights?

Regards,
Kalyanaraman.
