Dominik Wujastyk then replied

You could try looking at

C. G. Uragoda, A history of medicine in Sri Lanka (Colombo, Sri Lanka
Medical Association, 1987).  A good book.

and some more items.

Dominik seems rather well informed, so I'd like to ask him (and the others) if he also knows something about books on (history) of VETERINARIAN medicine?
