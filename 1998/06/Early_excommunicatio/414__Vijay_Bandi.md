Didnt they come from southern bihar or there abouts? (source:
'Andhrula caritra' by Yetukuri). There is a hypothesis that they
started migrating south circa 1000 bce and completed the process
some 1500 years later. Another name for Andhra is Telugu (eponymous
with the language spoken by them) and the same author suggests
that this name means 'south-facing' ('ten' = south in proto dravid).

Its reasonable to assume that the immigrants from north and the
native nagas of deccan and river deltas merged to form what is now
telugu naadu.
