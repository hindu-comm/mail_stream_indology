I am glad that someone is looking for the excellent visistadvaita scholar
Eric Lott. He left Bangalore nearly a decade ago. He has settled down in
England. His address then was Dr.Eric J. Lott, 51, Clumber road,
Leicester, LE5 4FH, U.K. I think he is still at this address because he
has not spoken to me about changing house. He was in Bangalore about two
months ago.
