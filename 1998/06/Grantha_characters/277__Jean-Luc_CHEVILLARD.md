It is difficult to know what the word "this"
refers to in prof. Claus 's statement, which
will make matters even worse, since there is already
a confusion in the first answer

As I understand it, gurmukhi is a North Indian Script
(it has even a Unicode range assigned),
and there are commercial packages available for it
that should not be pirated ;;;  :-)

As regards Grantha, it is/was used, as explained below
by DEVARAKONDA VENKATA NARAYANA SARMA, in Tamil Nadu
for writing Sanskrit (many sanskrit manuscripts are in Grantha).

As regards sanskrit fonts in Grantha Typeface,
the French Institute in Pondicherry was very much
desirous to find one, a few years ago, but could not
succeed. The situation might hopefully have improved
but it is not absolutely certain, since popular demand
will be low ...  :-)

As regards a font editor for creating a sanskrit font
in Grantha typeface from scratch, please consider that it is
a lot of work: you will lose a lot of time and the result
will not be satisfactory ... ;-)

If you are not afraid, join the comp.fonts newsgroup (on UseNet) !!!

The best solution would be to convince C-Dac or some company
like it to create one ... That's my best advice ...
