Those interested in Grantha may like to know--or be reminded, since
it was mentioned some time back on this list--of K. Venugopalan's _A
Primer in Grantha Characters_.  This small book was published
privately in 1983 by James H. Nye (bibliographer of the Southern
Asian Collection of the Univ. of Chicago Library).  I don't know to
what extent it is available in libraries.
