There is a book by Stuart Gordon "The Marathas", Oxford U. Press, 1994 --I
haven't laid my hands on it yet-- which might address some of the issues
raised by Vidyasankar.
Does anyone happen to know the name of Shahaji's second wife (and third, if
there was one)? I know the first was Deepaa or Deepaambaa.
Yigal Bronner.
