I have had a message from Prof. Bhate in Pune asking whether I know
anything about the 11th World Sanskrit Congress, which she says is to be
held in Turin. I have not heard anything about this; there aren't any
announcements on the Indology home page, and I can't find any reference in
recent discussion either.

Can anyone help?

John Smith
