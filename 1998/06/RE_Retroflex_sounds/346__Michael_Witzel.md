I should have been clearer:

(1) 8000 BC barely (!) dogs, no metals, and I think no pottery yet in S,
Asia:  For example no pottery in earliest Mehrgarh (6500 BC)

(As far as I remember, dogs make their entry as domesticated wolves by c.
10,000.)

(2) 4000 BC/PRE-INDUS :  no horses, chariots... little copper..

Bedankt voor de nauwkeurigkeid...
