Greetings

Strange as it may seem ... I was wondering if anyone might be able to
direct me towards any video tapes of the long running Indian T.V serial
"Sword of Tipu" - either loan or sale. I would also be very interested in
hearing views on either this programme or the popular view of Tipu Sultan.

Thanks in advance
With Best Wishes

Simon Haines
