If you can supply me with a list of exactly what characters you want, and
preferably exactly where you want them to go (what positions they should
have in the encoding), I can supply you with suitable high-quality
freeware fonts. (This is on the assumption that all the diacriticals you
require are either standard ones -- e.g. macron, breve -- or easily
created from standard ones -- e.g. underring, underdieresis.)
