Not to forget the term for a baked brick.

Some archaeologists, e.g., the late  W. A. Fairservis Jr., are of the
firm opinion that a reconstructed artifactual vocabulary of the IVC
would be a significant resource for the decipherment of the Indus
script.

It might also throw interesting sidelight on linguistic contact and
convergence (?!) or the lack of it , in prehistoric South Asia.

Warm Regards.
