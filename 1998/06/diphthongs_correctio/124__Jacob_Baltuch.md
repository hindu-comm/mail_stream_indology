Just to correct something I wrote in my previous post.

Michael of course never said the e was pluti, but that zreSTha was metrically
worth 3 syllables.

So let me rephrase:

>If I understand what you're saying the fact that zreSTha has 3 syllables
>must be a relic of an original [zrai'iSTha] pronunciation. But why couldn't
>it be the relic of a [zre:'iSTha] pronunciation?
