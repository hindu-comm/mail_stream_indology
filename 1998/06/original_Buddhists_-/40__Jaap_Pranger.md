An illustration of two stone structures in Brahui country,
called 'Cheda pillars' by the author, is to be found in
Henry W. Bellew's "From the Indus to the Tigris",
London 1874, on page 56.

The illustrated structures, although much smaller, look very similar
to stupas.  Bellew: "They are erected to the memory of
clansmen who have died without issue........"

Could these be distant memories to a buddhist past ?

Any clues/ opinions as to these structures ?

Jaap Pranger
