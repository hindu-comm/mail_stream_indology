Dear Beatrice,
        I thank you sincerely for this extract but, not understanting it
well, I'd have an other request:
        Despite the "With reference to these", it seems we have a big break
in the reasoning, between 'speech' and 'river'/'deity'. Even if we read
"vAc (deity)" and if we suppose a metonymy vAc/sarasvatI (both deities),
the 'river' is still far. An ellipsis of the metaphor 'speech'/'river'? Are
you (or someone else) in a position to explain this?
        Best regards,
Dominique
