The Center for Electronic Text and Image at the University of Pennsylvania
Library has an ongoing project to digitize images from the AIIS photo
archive. Some images are already available for online use. I could not
determine, however,  whether online use may legally include  downloading to
an individual computer, or not. The main page for the South Asia Art
Archive is http://www.library.upenn.edu/etext/sasia/aiis/index.html. Follow
links under the heading Subject Categories of AIIS Photograph Archive.
