Dr. Fosse,

Another is an exhibit from the Sackler Gallery, Puja, Expressions of
Hindu Devotion.

Within the next month I will begin putting up somw of my own photographs
from Orissa.  These include persons and places, some temples and temple
sculpture, ancient and contemporary, and handloom silks.  If any of that interests
you, that site will be linked to my home page at
