Dear Mariana Caixeiro,
my name is Riccardo Garbini and my research field is Indian epigraphy.
You can easily infer what kind of interest stimulated your letter.
I would really like to study these inscription.
Likely, the more easy way would be to check the pictures of these inscription.
You may send some good picture (or drawings) of these inscriptions to the
following address:
                        Dr. Riccardo Garbini
                        c/o Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente
                                (IsIAO) - Via Merulana 248
                                00185 - Roma -Italia

Hoping to hear news from your side,
