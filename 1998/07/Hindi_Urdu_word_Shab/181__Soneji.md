I am looking for historical or etymological information on the Hindi/Urdu
word "Shabhash", often used as a term of encouragement especially in
artistic contexts.  I am not sure if I have even transliterated it
correctly, but the Telugu manuscript in which I have found it spells it
as "ShAbhAshu". Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
Devesh Soneji
