        I am afraid, the "Harappan" antiquity of Akhal Teke horses is
a myth. They appear much later (probably came with the Arabs?).
Archaelolgists working in Central Asia say that in South Turkmenia (in
contrast to North-East Iran = Gurgan region) there is no evidence of
domesticated horse till the Namazga VI period (= Late BMAC).

        Yes, and this "influence" is so evident: the practice of chariot
warfare first appears in Gurgan region and BMAC, and THEN in Vedic India.
Could you refer to any evidence of such practice in Indus/Sarasvati
Civilization? I do not mean simply the acquaintance with horse and the
presence of horse remains.

        OK, and who were the "Dasas, Dahyu and Panis"? According to Parpola,
whom you refer to, they were Aryans - though not Indo-Aryans, but Eastern
(or Northern) Iranians, proto-Scythians (Aryans all the same)!
       Now most archaeologists seem to agree that BMAC emerged as a result
of a synthesis in which an ancient local culture interacted with Aryan
newcomers (probably, two waves of them: Indo-Aryans from the West and then
Eastern Iranians from the North) - under strong influences from Elam,
Syria/Mesopotamia and Indus/Sarasvati.
       By the way, the discovery of BMAC just makes true the "heretical"
suggestion offered as early as in the 1940-ies and early 1950-ies by
R.N.Dandekar who wrote that the ancestors of Vedic Indians and Avestan
Iranians had lived together in the "region around Balkh" for a pretty long
time before their final separation (see e.g. his article on "VritrahA Indra").
