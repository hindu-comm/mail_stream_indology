The BORI published parts of Devabodha's Jnaanadiipikaa in the 1940s and the
introductions to these provide some useful information.  As far as studies
go, all I know of are sections 14 & 15 of the third volume of Holtzmann's
MBh und seine Theile.  I think the greatest desideratum with regard to MBh
commentaries, and a pre-requisite for any serious comparative study, is an
edition of Arjunamisra.  For the small patches of his commentary I have
seen, I find him more laconic than NiilakaNTha (for whom I have a high
regard),  but also more penetrating.
