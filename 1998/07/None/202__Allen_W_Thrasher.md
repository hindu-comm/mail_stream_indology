Elliott Stern was asking about the form:

* dAnaM dadau rAmam

This is not directly related to his question, but in Latin inscriptions
commemorating donations one routinely finds the form Donum dedit, often
abbreviated D.D.  This leads one to think it's an Ur-IE legal formula,
however you interpret its grammar and semantics.
