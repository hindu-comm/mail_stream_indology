        Welcome to this new pancake, well-described by the comparison with
the moon!
        Mayrhover (KEWA) confirm the link with praakr. pappa.da-(ga)- and
many other, like hindii paapar, &c. But he give nothing about etymology,
except a link with Ved. parphariikaa where PTS Pali-English Dictionary, sv.
papa.tikaa, is quoted (but the semantical link seems dubious and the
Sayana's or Yaska's commentary about parphariikaa is very far from the
pancakes).
        Why not parpa 'wheel-chair for cripples'? Or (MW) parpariika 'sun'?
