I believe N. Ganesan is looking for another professor Asher,
who is a specialist of Tamil [and also a general linguist
(University of Edinburgh: he was the general editor for some
huge encyclopedia of linguistics that was published some 5 years back]

I was able to find some old adress,
but I am not sure it is still valid:

Professor R.E. Asher
Department of linguistics
15 Buccleuch place
 Edinbourough EH8 9LN
 United Kingdom
