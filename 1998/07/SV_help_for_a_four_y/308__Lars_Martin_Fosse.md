Based on my personal experience, the Süd-Asien Institut in Heidelberg is a very good place to study anything South-Asian. I also had good experience with the Indologisches Seminar at the University of Bonn. The nice thing about Bonn is that you can also follow Indological lectures at the University of Cologne (which I did). Of course, you could also do vice versa!

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
