to which I add

  C1. The ocean was dumped tea into by the revolutionaries.

Why is that *not* a raising (or move-alpha or whatever) of
the locative to a subject position?

Is it simply that it is not correct English? (not such a
far-fetched option :-) or is there some other reason...?

(Ok, that's English but what the hell, if the principle
is operational in Sanskrit and an English example can
help clarify it, wouldn't you say that it becomes ok
on an Indological list?)

> Clarifications welcome

You can say that again :-)
