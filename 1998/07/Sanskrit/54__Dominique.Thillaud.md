        Perhaps just a problem with 'semantically'.
        At low-level we can consider passive and causative being reciprocal
functions:
1) le chat mange la souris
2) * le chat fait Ãªtre mangee la souris (= le chat fait que la souris est
mangee [par le chat])
3) * le chat est fait manger la souris (= que le chat mange la souris est
fait [par le chat])
        Evidently, 1) = 2) = 3) is just a low-level equivalence, not a
fully semantical equivalence. The same occurs with the double negation: not
just an assertion but a strong assertion.
