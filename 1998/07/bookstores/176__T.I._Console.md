Jacob Baltuch asked for a linguist bookstore.

Well, I'm living in the Netherlands, but I've never found a good one. The better bookstores, like Ginsberg in Leiden (Breestraat) and Broese Keemink in Utrecht (Stadhuisbrug) have lots of Europa-oriented books, but hardly any on an exotic plan. I think it is logical: Dutch people want to rent, hire, lease, but never buy!

Why don't you try http://www.amazone.com, the greatest bookstore on the web? Look for References, than Linguistics, and type the keyword you like.
