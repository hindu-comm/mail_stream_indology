We were talking about an example with the verb 'darzayati' I believe in the
meaning of 'show'.

That the 2nd accusative of the (theoretical) double accusative construction
of darzayati was considered an indirect object by the users of the language
themselves is made plain by the fact that that accusative is much more commonly
replaced by a dative or a genitive.
