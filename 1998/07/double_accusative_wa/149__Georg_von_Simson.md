Of course, we are talking about semantic roles or kArakas. But case endings
are *normally* correlated with a semantic role, and my point was that we
should not without necessity disregard such a normal correlation. The "low
transitivity" Boris Oguibenine was talking about, is not the same as the
role of "indirect object", and his analysis

does not quite convince me because you cannot say "taM pustakaM dadAti". It
is true that with transitive verbs there is a primary object and a
secondary object, but, as examples with intransitive verbs show ("dUtaM
grAmaM gamayati"), the person affected can and should still be taken as a
direct object (see also the conversion into passive, discussed earlier). It
is therefore I suggest in the case of darzayati a semantic shift from "he
makes someone (acc.) see something (acc.)" to "he makes something (acc.)
seen=visible to somebody (dat., later also gen.)." That seems to me a
better strategy than to jump to the conclusion that an accusative ending
can express the role "indirect object".
