Excuse me for an utterly non-Indological question:

Would this be the Igor of the Borodin opera Prince Igor??

By the way, ancient epics of all sorts are usually made up of standard
legendary/mythical material ("literary archetypes") interspersed with
nuggets of historical material that is often difficult to identify, not to
say verify. Just look at the description of Attila in Germanic epics! A
clear warning not to read too much history into the Niebelungen story. 

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
