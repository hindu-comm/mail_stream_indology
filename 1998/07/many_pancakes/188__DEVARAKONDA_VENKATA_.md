According to suryarAyAndhra nighaNTu (A eight volume telugu dictionary)

maMDega= "a preparation made with fine wheat flour and ghee(ghRtam=clarified
butter)". kannaDa:'maMDage','maMDige'. tamil:'maMdihai'.sanskrit:'maNDakaH'

One lexicon (sabdaratnAkara)says it is sugarless puri (thin wheat flour
pancake fried in oil or ghee).
