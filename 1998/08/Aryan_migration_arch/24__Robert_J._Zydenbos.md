Dominik,

Is there already an INDOLOGY archive available of the recent "Aryan
migration" debate? I've noticed that Hindutva people are trying to
get their foot into other Internet forums too, and it would be nice
if one could give a reference to an archive rather than write out
and repeat the same refutations that were already given here.
