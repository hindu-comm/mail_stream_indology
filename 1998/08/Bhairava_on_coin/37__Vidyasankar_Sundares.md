Nilakantha Sastri's History of South India (4th ed., Oxford University
Press) talks of a hoard of Telugu Coda coins that was discovered early
this century (p. 5-7). Someone somewhere (Altekar, T. A. Gopinatha Rao,
H. Krishna Sastri?) must have done an analysis of them. It might help to
check for references on this.

Vidyasankar
