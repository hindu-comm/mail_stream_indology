I missed this point till now.

The change c^ -> c cannot be later than the second palatalization (change
of PIE *k/*k-super-w to c^ before e/i) which must have preceded the
merger of e/o/a. So, under the above scenario, the merger of e/o/a must
be later than the split of Indian from Iranian.

I find this quite incredible.
