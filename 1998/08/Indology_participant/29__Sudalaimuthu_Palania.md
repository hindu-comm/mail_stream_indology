Indology seems to have very little traffic nowadays. So, this may a good time
to ask this question which has been at the back of my mind for sometime.

If I am not mistaken, the geographical distribution of Indology participants
of Indian origin seems to be abnormal in one sense. Most seem to be from the
pancadrAviDa area. The rest of India seems not to be well represented. Is
there an explanation for this?
