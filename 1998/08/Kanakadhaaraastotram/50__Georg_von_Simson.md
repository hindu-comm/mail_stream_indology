k.r.sii.s.ta is obviously a 3. sg. aatmanepadam precative (or benedictive)
of the root k.r: "may him make". See M. R. Kale, A Higher Sanskrit Grammar,
#587 (p.358). The form is rare, of course. Whitney, Sanskrit Grammar, #925
b (p. 328) says: "The precative middle is virtually unknown in the whole
later literature, not a single occurrence of it having been brought to
light." So this seems to be a discovery!

Georg v. Simson
