Dear Girish Sharma,

maybe some considerations may help you. Considering the context, I would
expect k.r.sii.s.ta to be a finite verb (not a nomen as Dominique Thillaud
seems to suggest). Further, I expect to find the expression of a wish.
On the morphological level -ii.s.ta looks like a precative ending (3 sg of
the middle voice), -s- seems to be an augment. k.r should belong to the root
k.r (to make). Remains the question which stem the precative is formed of. I
guess, it is formed from an aorist stem (but that is my usual guess whenever
I cannot explain a finite verb).
