Dear members,

As a student in master's degree in Indian Art
History and Archeology in Paris (Sorbonne),
I am working on the iconography of the
Nine Planets (Nava Graha).
I am looking for bibliographical references
and any information on this topic.

Every answer will be welcome.
Thanks in advance.

Magali Vacherot
