I have a question regarding these sound changes:

It depends on the exact phonetics of Proto-Indo-Iranian.

Clearly, the satem and the ruki-phenomena are the oldest, as they are
shared by Indo-Iranian, Balto-Slavic and Armenian.  For "proto-satem"
(proto-East-Indo-Eropean), we can assume:

The fact that a certain phenomenon is shared by some languages does not exclude the possibility that they occurred independently in some of  - or all of - the languages. How do we know that the changes are not independent?


Best regards,
