Dear Prof.Wujastyk,
I take your point and thank you for clarifying. As I said in my previous
message I did not mean to be critical but just wondered if there is some
way of distinguishing commercial matters from useful information. But my
sincere apologies to you for any misunderstanding that I might have created
in this matter. I surely appreciate your personal effort in going through
the trouble of offering this service to us as scholars.
