Once more time a fucking web site!
I was interested by content, not by a tremendously great picture, consuming
a lot of time and money before any serious information appears!
I resigned before the end. I'll never know what could be interesting.
The lesser internet etiquette is to leave a choice to the user, not to act
like an contemtible American moneymaker!
I don't know from where the site was made, but it's sure that the makers
understand fully the Bill Gates' spirit.
        Sorry for the words, not for the reaction,
Dominique
