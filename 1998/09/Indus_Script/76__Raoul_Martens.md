I would be grateful for bibliographic references to this review, and also to any other reviews and discussions of Rao's books ("Lothal and the Indus Civilization"; "The Decipherment of the Indus Script").<

In addition to "Decipherment of the Indus Script, Bombay 1982", Rao has
later published: "New light on Indus Script and Language, Frontiers of
the Indus Civilization, Indian Archaeological Society, 1984" and "Dawn
and Development of the Indus Civilization, Adita Prakashan, 1991".
