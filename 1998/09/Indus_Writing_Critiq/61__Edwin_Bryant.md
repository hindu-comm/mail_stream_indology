In addition to Mahadevan, there is a review of Rao by Norman, K.R. in
Lingua 63 (3-4): 313-324.  I imagine you are also aware of Greg Possehl's
'Indus Age: the Writing System' which critiques just about every
decipherment attempt including Raos's.  Best  Edwin.

I would be grateful for bibliographic references to this review, and also to any other reviews and discussions of Rao's books ("Lothal and the Indus Civilization"; "The Decipherment of the Indus Script").
