There is a 1984 English translation from Motilal Banarsidass and a 1985
translation from Munshiram Manoharlal. They include the texts of
Uddyotakara, Vacaspati Misra and Udayana too. Both publishers are on the
internet, so it should not be difficult to get hold of catalogs or
copies.

Regards,
Vidyasankar
