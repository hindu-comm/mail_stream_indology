Some households in India mention that 'it is written in the Vedas/Upanishads'
that 'special guests were served veal in the vedic era'.

A second thing mentioned in a similar vein is that 'near the end of the
Koli yug, the peeth (yellow) people will reign supreme in the world'.

Are these accurate? If so, what is the quote and where is it?
