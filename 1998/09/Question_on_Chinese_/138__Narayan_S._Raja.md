Haven't heard this legend.  If you find more
details about this, please share them.  Any
references?  Thanks in advance.

A rather boring work called "Tower of Myriad Mirrors"
does exist in English translation.  Nothing in there
about the above legend.

Nowadays in China, "Potalaka" is firmly identified with
Putuo Shan, a mountain and small island off the coast
near Shanghai and Taiwan in the East China Sea.  It
is considered one of the "four sacred mountains" of
Chinese Buddhism.  Pilgrims and tourists go there.

FYI,


Raja.
