 A hundred years ago we would have been
gathering in a salon to exchange the latest in gossip, academic and
artistic development, politics, and so on; today we have a listserv group.

An interesting thought! Of course, a hundred years ago, all of us (not quite so many as today) would probably have been able to fit into one of those huge, wonderful salons of the fin-de-siecle  (I hope, in a house of GOOD repute!) The thought of cramming us all into a salon today seems positively mind-boggling.

It takes a salon the size of Internet.

With convivial greetings,

Lars Martin Fosse
