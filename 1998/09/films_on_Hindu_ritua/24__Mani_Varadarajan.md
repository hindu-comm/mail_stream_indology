I am trying to obtain several films produced
by H. Daniel Smith on the rituals of the Sri Vaishnavas
of South India. Can anyone tell me if these are
available anywhere, or whether they are available
through interlibrary loan in the United States?

The bibliographic information is:

  Image India: The Hindu Way
  Eleven Films on Hindu Ritual
  Syracuse University: 1969
  H. Daniel Smith

Please email me at mani at be.com.

Thanks,
Mani
