Dear list members,

For a scope note in the ABIA Index bibliography I am trying to find the birth
and demise dates of the Indian art historian C. Sivaramamurti, but I have
failed to come up with any definitive facts so far.
>â€‰From a commemoration volume dedicated to him in the eighties, I gather
that he passed away sometime between 1980 and perhaps 1985. I assume
obituaries were published...
Hoping for more information,

Ellen Raven
