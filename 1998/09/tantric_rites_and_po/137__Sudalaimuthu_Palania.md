Baidyanath Saraswati says the followingin Pottery-Making Cultures and Indian
Civilization (1978, p.88):

"In Tantra literature, we find a few esoteric rites connected with the
potter's wheel which also aim at the attainment of vigour."

Can anybody describe what these rites are or give references? Thanks in
advance.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
