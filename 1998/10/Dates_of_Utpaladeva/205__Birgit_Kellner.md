As I don't have the pertinent library-resources available at the moment,
could someone please fill me in on the current state of research
regarding the dates of Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta (esp. the former)?

My most recent source of reference (Torella's 1994 edition of the
I'svarapratyabhij~naakaarikaa) states 900/925-950/975 for Utpaladeva.

Many thanks in advance,
