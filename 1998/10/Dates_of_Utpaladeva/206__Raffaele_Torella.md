Utpaladeva's date mainly depends on Abhinavagupta's. Fortunately, the
latter was kind enough to put a (reliable) date at the end of his
I'svarapratyabhij~naa-vivrtivimarsini, which is likely to be one of his
last works. The date is 1015 A.D.(with the usual fluctuation of some
months). Utpaladeva is Abhinava's paramaguru.

With best wishes,
Raffaele Torella
