A reference:
Edward Thomas (1813-1886), The rivers of the Vedas
and how the Aryans entered India,
1883, 30 p. (from JRAS, new ser., v. 15)

This will have relevence today. Does he identify Ghaggar-Hakra
river as Sarasvati of the Rigveda?

Normally this identification is attributed to Sir Aurel Stein.
But he did that only in 1941.
(S. P. Gupta (ed.), An archaeological tour along the
Ghaggar-Hakra river, Meerut, 1989)

Can someone check please?

Regards,
N. Ganesan
