I omitted to mention in my last posting that the first 7 chapters of
the Kira.natantra have been translated into English.  This translation
appears on pp.341--70 of ``Hindu Scriptures'' (California University
Press and J.M.Dent 1996) and it is introduced on pp.xxxi--xxxviii of
the introduction.

A summary (in French) of the whole text is given by Mme. Brunner in her
article `Analyse du Kira.naagama' pp.309--29 of Journal Asiatique
CCLIII (1965).
