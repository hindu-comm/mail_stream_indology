One would expect such a migration to have been noticed and recorded
by the Sumerians and Akkadians of Mesopotamia.  (Unless it happened
in the 50 years or so of Gutian rule, between tha fall of Sargon's
Akkadian empire and the "Sumerian revival" of Gudea of Lagash and Ur
III).

The Hurrians themselves, when they appear in the neighbourhood of
Mesopotamia c. 2200, are said to do so from the north and east.
