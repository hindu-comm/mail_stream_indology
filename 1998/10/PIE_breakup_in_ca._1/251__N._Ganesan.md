My thanks to Mr. Vidal for explaining the "standard" IE model.
What strikes me is the vast expanse in time proposed by say,
Gimbutas and on the otherside, say Drews. Whether 5000 B.C.
or 1750 B.C?? More so, when we consider the fact that the
origins of IE is of central concern in the West for ages.

I could not locate Bill Darden's review of Drews' theory.
Tried to go to www.indoeuropean.org. Did not succeed yet.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
