I have heard from a South Indian Saivite that the Siva temples model Siva's
abode of Kailasa.
Is this a common theme that temples of a particular Deity represent the
abode of the particular Deity, or different parts of the cosmology
correspond to structures within a temple?  Are there papers or
books on this subject?  Or do you know people who have studied it?

Thank you for your help.
