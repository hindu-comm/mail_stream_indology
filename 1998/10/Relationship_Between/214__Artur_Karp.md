What immediately comes to mind are:

"The Hindu Temple" by Stella Kramrisch (Calcutta 1946; reprinted in Delhi
1976 by Motilal Banarsidass), and

"Architecture, Time and Eternity. Studies in the Stellar and Temporal
Symbolism of Traditional Buildings" by Adrian Snodgrass, Delhi 1990), where
extensive bibliography.

With regards,
