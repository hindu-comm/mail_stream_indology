It is my pleasure to inform you that the book of Prof. B. Oguibenine, of
which the English version has been recently announced by Dominik, had
also been published in Italian (Pisa: Giardini, 1985).

Judging from my own copy of the book, the Italian edition is in French, not in Italian. ("Essais sur la culture vedique et indo-europeenne").

Best regards,

Lars Martin
