        I agree. It's absolutely ridiculous to see the Eurindians as "male
warriors" only. They knew many Goddesses and I have established strong
links between Aphrodite and Sri (unpublished but quoted in Bernard Sergent,
Genese de l'Inde). We have the same plague in Greek studies where all
Goddesses are commonly supposed from a "creto-aegean substratum", a
post-romantic idea of a neolithic "Great Mother". Without any proof, except
perhaps in the unconscious of some scholars ;-)
