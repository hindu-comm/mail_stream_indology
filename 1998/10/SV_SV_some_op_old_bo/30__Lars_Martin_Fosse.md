booksellers there are who are very keen to post their book lists to the
INDOLOGY list, and at the size of their lists. If this door were opened
we would find a lot of such postings, increasing bandwidth significantly,
to the detriment of our more modestly-funded members.

the INDOLOGY web pages.  These booksellers can then make whatever
information they wish available to us.

In my view, the above two facilities surely meet the wishes of booksellers
and of us scholars very fully.


I accept the verdict of Dominik. As long as booksellers are able to tell us WHERE their lists may be found, the interests of both parties should be served. 

Best regards,
