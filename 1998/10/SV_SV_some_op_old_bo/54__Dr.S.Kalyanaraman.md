I remember there is a website created by Dr. David Magier which lists the
south asia book sellers; it is unfortunate, many of these booksellers do not
have their own webpages. There should be someway to help create a resource
list webpage of books on sale, on a website such as the indology website? Dr.
Domink's point about repetitive lists is an issue to resolve, though. When I
had met the Jayalakshmi Indology Bookseller in Chennai, I suggested that they
could link up with Amazon or barnesandnoble and add the indology book lists...
I have tried these two online booksellers who claim to list millions of books;
even there, it is tough to get a good indology book list.

Regards,
Kalyanaraman
