On the coming of the Indo-European speakers to India a recent synthesis (for
readers of French), covering the archaeology and comparativist literature
(linguistic and cultural), is Bernard Sergent's Gen√®se de l'Inde, Paris
Payot, 1997.  I would be interested to see any reactions to it.   Nick Allen
