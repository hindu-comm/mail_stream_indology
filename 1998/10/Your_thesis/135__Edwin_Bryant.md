I plan to have it in the hands of Oxford U. Press for review by Jan come
hell or high water.  In honesty, other research projects are beckoning and
I feel I have personally exhausted this topic intellectually.  Dominik had
asked me to post a position paper on Indology which I will do at some
point (if everyone has not become sick to death of the I-A problem) but
teaching pressures have brought all superfluous projects to a screeching
halt for now.  Best, Edwin
