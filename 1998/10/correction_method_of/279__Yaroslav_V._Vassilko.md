Of course, the difference between *vRddhAzva and *VArddhAzva, *saumati and
sumati - can not be described as the result of a vowel's "lengthening". It
is just the change from guNa to vRddhi state of a vowel. I am sorry for
this mistake which is due to the fact that my English is poor and I was in
a hurry at the moment.
