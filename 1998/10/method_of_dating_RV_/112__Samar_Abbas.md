 I always thought these were characteristic of all Aryan nations. Thus the
Iranian Aryans wore such clothes, as did the Scythic Aryans (as you have
pointed out). If the Indo-Aryans did not wear such clothes, then what did
they wear ? If they did not wear these `Scythic clothes', then did they
adopt the dress of the Dravidians ? These are just thougths that occurred
to me, I do not mean to challenge any authorities on this list ( I don't
know much in this field).
