Whatever the reference, it is not serious. To begin with, why is Prakrit
considered as "non-Aryan"? Then, what base there is to say that 40 % is
Dravidian, when the basic vocabulary of Dravidian has not been
reconstructed ? Moreover, many of the so-called Dravidian etymologies of
Indo-Aryan words are highly disputable.
