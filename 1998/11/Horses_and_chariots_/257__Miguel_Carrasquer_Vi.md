Actually, it goes like this:

You find Greek vases etc. in Ullastret.  Conclusion: Iberians traded
with Greeks.

You find Phoenician materials in Cyprus. Conclusion: Phoenicians
colonized this place.

You find Greek vases etc. in Emporion (Ampuries) or Rhode (Roses).
Conclusion: Greeks colonized this place.

You find Phoenician materials in Greece. Conclusion: Greeks traded
with Phoenicians.
