Maybe it's because I'm Spanish, but I don't think w > v > b is
unexpected at all: it's rather commonplace.  The changes k > x
(except before i) and c > k (before u) are natural enough (the front
vowel prevents spirantization (<backing?), the back vowel causes
backing [was PDr. *c a palatal stop?]), but it is true that I have
never seen that particular combination of sound changes under those
particular conditions before.  We can see them, but certainly not not
w > b, as rather strong evidence of a Northern Dravidian group.  But
I still don't understand how that proves the direction or the date of
movement.

If I understand the argument about the phonological enviroment
properly, I take it that neither Proto-North-Dravidian *i(:) nor
*u(:) have changed since the two sound laws took place (although I
see that Zvelebil in the EB claims that: "Compared to the
reconstructed system of Proto-Dravidian phonemes (distinctive
sounds), the most striking developments in vowels are the gradual
elimination of the contrast between e and e: (long e) and o and o:
(long o) in Brahui, as a result of the influence of Indo-Aryan
languages or Iranian or both; the raising of Proto-Dravidian *e and
*o to i and u and the lowering of these protolanguage sounds in
Brahui").  But even if the Brahui vowels had not changed, such a
thing would not be amazing.  The pattern /a/ /e/ /i/ /o/ /u/ can be
remarkably stable: we know that Basque (except for the Souletin
dialect) has not changed its vowel system one bit in at least 2000
years.

Not me.

Exactly...

Why not?  If it's independent in Kannada (or Spanish), so it can be
in Brahui.

That's additional evidence for North Dravidian.  It doesn't tell us
where and when such an entity existed.  Andronov (I think) derived
his dates (6000 ~ 5000 years) for the split between Brahui and
(North-)Dravidian from glottochronology, which we all agree is
suspect.  But is the divergence between Brahui and Kur-Mlt really
consistent with a separation of a mere 1000 years ("800-1100 CE")?
Language families at such an extremely shallow time depth (e.g.
Romance [c. 2000 y.] or Tamil-Malayalam [< 1500 y.?]) are not usually
controversial.
