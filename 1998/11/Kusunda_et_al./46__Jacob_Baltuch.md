Yes, how on earth did that thread jump from Nostratic to Indology?

Yes I was in the same situation. There was no good way to involve
prof. Krishnamurti in the discussion since he does not read the
Nostratic list and I think mixing lists and personal email addresses
in messages can only result in confusion, so I simply gave his email
in my message and relied on the fact that readers interested in his
argument could contact him directly if they wished.

Grin. It was me, but it was from B.Sergent's account of J.E.'s
paper. Please please do not rely on that to judge it. The reference
is: Joseph Elfenbeim, "A periplus of the Brahui problem", Studia
Iranica, 16.2 (1987), 215-233
