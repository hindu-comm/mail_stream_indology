This subject has been discussed before in INDOLOGY, and you may find
information by scanning the archives with keywords like "OCR" or "KDEM" or
"Kurzweil" or "Ingalls".

The last discussion was some time ago, and things may have moved on, of
course.  Anyone got any piping hot new information?

All the best,
Dominik
