"tur(u)ce" is one of the most common words on Etr. inscriptions.
Some examples from Beekes/v.d.Meer "De Etrusken spreken", 1991:

[on bronze statue:]
TLE 740: tite:alpnas:turce:aiseras:thuflthicla:trutvecie
"Tite Alpnas gave (this) to Aisera Thuflthica (because of an omen?)"

[on Attic dish:]
TLE 156: itun turuce venel atelinas tinas cliniiaras
"This gave Venel Atelinas to the children of Tin (=Dioskouroi)"

[on spade (persillum):]
TLE 622: eca kavtha$:achuia$:persie // avle numna$ turke
This spade for Kavtha Achuia, Avle Numnas gave (it).

And of course on the Etruscan-Phoenician bilingual from Pyrgi (TLE
874), where <Thefariei Velianas [sal cluvenias] turuce> probably
corresponds to Phoen. <W'$ YTN TBRY' WLN$>, "(and he, ) Tiberius
Velianas gave ..."
