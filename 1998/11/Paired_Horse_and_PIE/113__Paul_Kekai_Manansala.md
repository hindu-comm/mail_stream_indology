I don't know specifically about European literature, since it is written
in a broad range of languages.

However, just giving a few of the more extreme examples from the U.S.
try reading _The Bell Curve_ or the numerous works of Philippe Rushton.
Or even, on the lighter side, some of Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s recent
writings where he lauds Western culture as superior to that of others.

Also, you might try investigating the eugenic roots of a great segment
of the modern anthropological and genetic community of today.  As late
as the 1970s, many of today's top geneticists and anthropologists were
members of open eugenic societies.  A great number are still members of
those societies, which have changed their names and operate now on a
cryptic level.
