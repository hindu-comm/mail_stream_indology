Yes, you have the Sumerian "ur" and even in Southeast Asia and the
Pacific you have words like uru, ari, aru, uran, oran, etc. for "man,
people."

Again in Austronesian you have dan, dano, danum, tano for "water," and
"tunu" for "left-over water."  In Sumerian, "tin" means "liquid."

limited numbers of words without any reliable examples of morphology or
phonology.
