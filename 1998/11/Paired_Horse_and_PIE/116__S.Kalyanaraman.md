[snip]...ideas can be carried without the need for population movements.
> Paul Kekai Manansala

This seems to be the crux of the discussion thread as it has evolved so far.
Unless there is substantial material evidence, e.g., movements of
pottery-types, weapons, or chariots, it would appear to be a tough problem to
distinguish between the two categories of phenomena: diffusion of ideas and
demography.

There is a good possibility that many languages were the parole, ca. 3000 BC,
even in small geographical zones, as evidenced in Sumer; it is also notable
that multiple languages did not deter or handicap, the expansion of the
economic imperatives generated by the bronze-age discoveries.

Kalyan
