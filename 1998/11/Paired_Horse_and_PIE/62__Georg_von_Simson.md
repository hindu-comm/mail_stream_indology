But see Harry Falk: Schrift im alten Indien. Tuebingen, 1993 (a very
detailed research report!):   The Kharos.t.hi script was probably invented
only shortly before Ashoka and the Brahmi under Ashoka. There does not seem
to exist convincing evidence for Kharos.t.hi beginning as early as the 5th
c. BC.

See again Falk, who argues for the Brahmi script being influenced by both
Kharosthi and Greek script, but - in contradistinction to Kharosthi - not
directly by the Aramaic script.
As for the rest: thank you for the useful survey!

Best regards

Georg v. Simson
