***********************************
Dear Ganesan,
I am looking at the sintashta burial image reconstructed by
Prof. Koryakova;
f.http://sarasvati.simplenet.com/sintashta/sintashta2.ht=
m
This is dated to ca. 2000 BC; the wheel looks solid in this picture.
Are there other reports related to spoked wheels and what dates?
Regards,
Kalyanaraman
