No, I wouldn't do that. There are IA speakers in Central Asia today,
although I don't know any that lived a "Scythian" way of life in recent
times.  Practically all of the Altaic speakers lived such a life until
very recently. Some still live this way.  What type of culture did the
Sogdians have anyway.  Weren't they Manicheans?
