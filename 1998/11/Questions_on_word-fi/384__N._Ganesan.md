*Another interesting case seems to be where Sanskrit "kapAla" is
*rendered in Tamil as "kapAl" as shown below.

*vaittavan2 kapAl micai
*             (tiruccanta viruttam 42.4 or nAl. 793.4)

*(translation: having placed on his skull)

  Does this have anything to do with metrics?
  May be, the sandha viruttam does not allow
  "kapAlamicai". So, the AzvAr uses "kapAlmicai"??

  Indeed, many IA words come into Tamil via Prakrit.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
