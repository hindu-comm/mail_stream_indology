Hi Lars,

Every time you post, I do get attachments.

Go to indology archives. There your attachments
are included as unreadable scribble.

Also, there are no return keystrokes of your
writeup. It is one long line.

The original writeup by someone and
your response to it are not clearly
demarcated.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
