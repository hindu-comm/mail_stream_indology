I'm not sure Akkadian counts as a relevant language, but w- > zero is
common there.  The lack of an adequate way of writing /w-/ in
cuneiform script (Sumerian didn't have w- either) is certainly
relevant.  Hurrian and Hittite had to resort to the sign PI for
/w/+any vowel (occasionally used in Old Akkadian to denote
wa/we/wi/wu), in Hurrian often in ligature with other signs, e.g.
PI+a = wa; to the sign MI for /wi/ (in later Akkadian, -m- > -w-
between vowels, so M-signs could be used to render /w/), or (Hittite
only, I think) the sign G~ES^TIN "wine" (Hitt. wiyana) also for /wi/.
The most common solution was to use the vowel sign U or U2 (u2-a-tar
= watar).

Possibly.  But how would we know?
