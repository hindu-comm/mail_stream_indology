 O. Szemer'enyi, Structuralism and Substratum - Indo-Europeans
and Semites in the Ancient Near East,
Lingua, 13, 1-29, 1964

Szemer'enyi investigates the exceptions to the rule that
PIE phonology is built on a 5-vowel system. Noting that
both Sanskrit and Avestan use a 3-vowel system, he says
that this is adopted from the Semitic languages of
Mesopotamia. Is this accepted by Indo-Iranianists?
Does the Kikkuli text also show that Aryans should
have been in Mesopotamia before they entered India?

Regards,
N. Ganesan
