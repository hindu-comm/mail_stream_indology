In the context of the IE homeland problem, Mallory "In Search of the
Indo-Europeans", especially pp. 243-257.  Also Renfrew, "Archaeology
and Language", for a completely different view.  About the changes
that took place regarding meat and milk, less tendentiously called
the "Secondary Products Revolution", see A. Sherrat "Plough and
Pastoralism: aspects of the secondary products revolution", in:
Hodder/Isaac/Hammond, "Patterns of the Past", 1981.  About the "Old
European" culture (mainly in the Balkans), Gimbutas' "The Mother
Goddess" (or something like that, can't find the ref.).  Mallory
gives a reference to Barker, "Prehistoric Farming in Europe", 1985,
which might have more details on the northern European LBK/TRB/Corded
Ware cultures, but I haven't seen it.  A good overview of the
relevant period in Europe, with more references, are chps. 5, 6 and 7
of Champion/Gamble/Shennan/Whittle, "Prehistoric Europe", 1984.
