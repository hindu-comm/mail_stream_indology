Ved Acharya's material is like communist textbooks in
Hungary.  It's not worth examining the motive or
give it any credence.  All lies have their natural deaths.
One should probably make political protests in UP
against fabrication and miseducation

People in politics can be dogmatic and we can't do
much to change it.  Creationist theories are taught
in some schools in US, and we just do not have the
energy to challenge it.  It's local..
