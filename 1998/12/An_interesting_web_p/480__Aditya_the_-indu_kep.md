I have not read any discussion on this nor is there a link to express one's
opinion on the author's views.

In my view the author is very confused. The fact that Mahabharat and
Ramayan are books of fiction and not history has nothing to do with AIT.
One can evaluate the character of the two epics by its story line and style
and easily come to the conclusion that the authors were just writing an
allegory to illustrate their own ideas and nothing else.
