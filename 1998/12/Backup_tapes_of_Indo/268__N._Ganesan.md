Dear Dr. D. Wujastyk,

It is great to have INDOLOGY. Thanks.

Is there a procedure to back up all the Indology archives?
It will be very valuable, say after 50 years, to check on
many debates, references, themes, ideas, speculations etc.,

Also, In the Indology archives, there are lot of unreadable
scribble emanating from the Microsoft Attachment problem.
They can be scrapped to save computer space.

With kind regards,
N. Ganesan
