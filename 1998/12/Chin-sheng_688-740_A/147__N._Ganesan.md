I checked OCLC database with author as Wang Gang-wu or
Wang Gang Wu. Nothing shows up.

As a subject I get 3 titles: all unrelated to
Buddhism, T'ang dynasty etc.,

Can please Harbsmeier be asked to give
few titles?

More biblio info please.

Thanks,
N. Ganesan


-----------------------------

My colleague C. Harbsmeier (sinologist), who happened to be in my room
when
your message came, suggests that you consult the publications of Wang
Gang-wu (former president of Hong Kong University) to find relevant
information about the author in question.

Best wishes
