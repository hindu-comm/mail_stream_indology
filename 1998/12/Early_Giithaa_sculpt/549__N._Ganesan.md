20th century Indian homes are filled with the
pictures/handicrafts of Krishna and Arjuna on
a chariot drawn by horses? How old is this
art motif?

Is it created aftr Giithaa's rise to the position
of the Hindu equivalent of Bible and Koran?
Or, does this have an earlier representation?
How old is this in Indian art?

For Krishna in the South, usually he is
Baalakrishna with butter or Kaaliyamardana, etc.,
In Pahari or Rajput paintings, it is the
lover, Krishna with Radha. In Gupta art,
I don't recall any of Giithopadesham.

Are there any old representations of Krishna
preaching to Arjuna in Indian art? How old these
go back?

My recollection is it is very rare, not the
position portrayed by Neohindus now. Is this correct?

Regards,
N. Ganesan
