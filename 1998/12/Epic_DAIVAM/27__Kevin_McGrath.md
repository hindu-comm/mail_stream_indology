Dear Dominique,
        Yes, I see your point. It is strange though that these ksatriyas
talk so much about what is 'action': often these speeches are in the
mouths of women - Draupadii, Kuntii.
        I feel that translating daivam by 'fate' misses something. It also
assumes a sense of personal autonomy or volition which I am not sure is
part of this culture.

                        Kevin.
