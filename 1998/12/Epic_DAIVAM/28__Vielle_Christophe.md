        Since that daivam results in fine from the supreme will of BrahmA
(as DhAtR or VidhAtR) in the epic, especially in the Mbh, the concept is
very close with the Greek Dios boulè, the supreme will of Zeus in the
Iliad. The "divine will" could be a translation (the two ideas are compared
in the recent book by myself: Le mytho-cycle héroïque dans l'aire
indo-européenne: correspondances et transformations helléno-aryennes,
Louvain-la-Neuve: Peeters Press, 1996, Publications de l'Institut
orientaliste de Louvain 46, p. 119-121).
