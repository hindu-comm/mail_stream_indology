And am I mentioned in it?

Yours deservingly,


Raja.




I don't know the entire debate on Brahma but he is either 1) Nirguna
(propertiless) or 2) Saguna with the only attributes of Satchitananda
(Truth,Existence and Eternal Bliss). I don't think any possessions are
mentioned for Brahma to have a will :)
