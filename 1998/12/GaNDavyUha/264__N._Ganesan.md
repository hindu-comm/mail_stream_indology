Greetings, Prof. Gimello

Do you have a bibliography on GaNDavyUha similar
to the one you gave on KaaraNDavyUha?

Material from South Indian history and from Tamil sangam poetry
of about 2500 songs (about 20 centuries old) help to
identify about 9 places where Sudhana, the merchant boy
meets KalyaaNamitras. I will write about them.
(So far, it has not been done this way I think).

Regards,
N. Ganesan
