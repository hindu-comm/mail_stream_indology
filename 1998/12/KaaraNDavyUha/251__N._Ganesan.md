In KaaraNDavyUhasUtra, is the word Potalaka as the
residence of Avalokitezvara mentioned?

Does SimhaladvIpa occur in KaaraNDavyUha?
Does dakSiNApatha come there & Avalokita
travels from there by vimAna to Jetavana
near Benaras?

 If SimhaladvIpa occurs, I wonder are there
any mahAyAna texts that mention SimhaladvIpa?

Are there any Western language studies on
KaaraNDavyUha?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
