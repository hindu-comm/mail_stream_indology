Indeed, there is much more to connect Avalokiteshvara with Brahman (who in
many respects can be considered an opposite of Shiva!), see Lokesh Chandra,
The Thousand-armed Avalokitezvara, New Delhi, 1988, especially Ch. 2 (pp.
18-28): "The Origin of Avalokita-svara/Avalokit-ezvara."
Or has Lokesh Chandra's theory about the origin of Avalokiteshvara been
refuted? To me it sounded quite convincing.
