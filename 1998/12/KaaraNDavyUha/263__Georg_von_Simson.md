It's funny that we both refer to Lokesh Chandra (see my last message). It
seems that the common features of Shiva and Avalokiteshvara are due to that
process of "acculturation of 'Siva into Buddhist tradition" L. Ch. mentions
in your quotation whereas Avalokiteshvara's origin points into a different
direction.
