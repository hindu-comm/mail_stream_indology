 Hanuman is thought by some to have been originally a Dravidian monkey-god
who was later incorporated into the Aryan pantheon. So it is only natural
to expect him to have originally spoken Tamil. Older Dravidian versions
of the Ramayana are more likely to have preserved this feature.
Sanskritization came later, and there is no contradiction.
