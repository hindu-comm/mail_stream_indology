        The situation from Kamban's RAmAyaNa, described by N.Ganesan,
does
not give any ground for such generalization. Hanuman speaks with Seethai
in
the forest of Asoka trees just because SHE IS A WOMAN, and the antaHpura
is
not a place to speak Sanskrit! In the Mbh there is a story of Indra's
attempt to seduce RucI, wife of a RSi. To prevent it, the RSi's pupil
Vipula
leaves his own body and keeps guard inside the body of RucI. When Indra
gallantly addresses the beauty, Vipula answers him in her voice. Indra
is
greatly astonished to hear correct Sanskrit speech from a woman (even
the
wife of a great Brahmin sage)! He immediately understands that some
other
person speaks through her mouth.

  Thanks, Prof. Vassilkov.

  Tamil poets from the sangam classical era pay
  devotion to Tamil. Kamban, the greatest Tamil
  poet, just uses that idea. To relieve pain
  and comfort Seetha, Hanuman uses Tamil to soothe
  her. That's all.

  Devotion to Tamil continues. Old habits die hard. :-)

  Regards,
  N. Ganesan
