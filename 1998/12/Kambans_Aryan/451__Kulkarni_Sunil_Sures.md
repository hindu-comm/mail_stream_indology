I am not a scolar of this subject but then I think we can have very good
reference to
             The Marathi Version of the Gita, the 'Gyaneshwari ' ( exact
translation in english means Goddes of Knowlege ) wrriten by 'Saint
Gyaneshwar' at the edge of 18 around, 12 or 13 th centuary . This is taken
as the most importent work in Marathi language and is considered to be a
root cause of the evolved 'BhatiSaMparadaya' in Maharashtra.  It seems
that before this centuary also, atleat in Maharashtra, 'Gita' in form of
'Gyaneshwari' was given high importence.
