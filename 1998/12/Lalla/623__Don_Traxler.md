Is anyone working on the sayings of Lalla (Lal Ded, Lalleshwari), the
fourteenth century mystic and poet of Kashmir? I am aware that a similar
question was asked by another subscriber to this list a couple of years ago,
but would like an update.
Also, is anyone working on old Kashmiri?

Thanks in advance.

Wear only enough clothes to keep away the cold,
Eat only enough food to banish hunger.
Contemplate your own self in meditation,
O mind, give this advice to the body.
