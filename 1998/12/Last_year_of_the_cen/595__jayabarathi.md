                The last year of the century should be 2000 A.D.
                The next century would only start with 2001 A.D.
                As was the case with the 1st century A.D. which
        started with 1 A.D. and ended with 100 A.D.
                A century is 1-100 and a millenium is 1-1000.
                Ninty-nine runs don't make a century, do they?:-)

        Regards

        JayBee
