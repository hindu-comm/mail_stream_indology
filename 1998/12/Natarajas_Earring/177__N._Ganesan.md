*Nataraja wears a female earring in his left ear (kundala) while his
*right ear, though pierced, is bare. One can explain this by child
*like stories which say that his right earring fell off while dancing.
* The truth of the matter is that Nataraja is an ardhanirshvara and
*therefore must express his feminine aspect.

  Is this attested in Kashmir 'Saivaite texts?

  With kind regards,
  N. Ganesan
