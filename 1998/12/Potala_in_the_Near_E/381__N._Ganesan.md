See Mallmann's work on Avalokitezvara.

Despite GaNDavUha and Xuanzang saying that
Potalaka, the home of Avalokitezvara, is
situated in the Malaya mountains' verdantly
green and tropical rain forests,
earlier attempts were made to trace Potalaka
to 'Garden of Eden', the paradise of the Near East!!!


Regards,
N. Ganesan
