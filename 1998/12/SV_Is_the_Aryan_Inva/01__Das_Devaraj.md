Quite a provocative statement...  wonder how many linguists feel
the same way?  Nice to see at least one person with a firm
conviction.

[ donning linguistic resistant flame suit ]

This is too good to resist :-) In the not too distant past (month
or so ago?) there was a very brief and interesting discussion about
Dominique Thillaud's name and gender.  Somebody posted a message
(one might add, a message with a linguistic slant) for the reason
why Dominique's name (a man by his own admission) was mistaken
for a woman's name.

Just out of idle curiousity, I am wondering...  If linguistic
interpretation is so great that a mistake like this can be made
about a living person's name, wonder how good it is for predicting
what happened thousands of years ago?
