Krishna wrote :

Sumarian civilization is considered to be the first Civilization
dating back to 3000BC from the history books.

But Geeta was dating back to 5561 BC [Ref. The scientific
Dating of Mahabharata by Dr.PV.Vartak] which is contradicting
the history books that Sumarian is the first civilization.

can you through some more light on this?

Anyone wants to respond to this ? This dating has been done using the
position of the stars and planets as described in the Mahabharata of Rshi
Ved Vyas.
