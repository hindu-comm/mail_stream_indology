Dear Martin Gansten,
I suggest the following Sanskrit Primers and a Dictionary in Hindi to
learn Sanskrit :
1.Sanskrit - Vyaakara.na-kaumudii, by Ishvara Chandra Vidyasagar, in
four parts.
2.Sanskrit - svayam-''sikshaka-prabhaa, by Gauri Shankar Shastri.
3.Kale Higher Sanskrit Grammar (Hindi Edition).
4.Sanskrit-Hindi-ko''sa, by Vaman Shivaram Apte.

With regards,
M.M.Agrawal
