Dear Sri. N. S. Raja,

I can understand that Narayana of Srirangam
                      ^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^
has to contest the 'Siva-Avalokita connections :-) :-)

*This is a really interesting link, one

*Would like to know more...

   Please read M. Deshpande, Who inspired Panini?
   JAOS, 1997.

   Also, I posted 4 long postings (about 35k)
   under the title, Where was Panini inspired? (Part i),
   where i=I,II,III and IV to INDOLOGY. Pl. read them after
   the above paper to know the context.

*Pardon my ignorance, but what's that?

  Avalokita means to look down, gaze, see.
  'Siva is called dhrishtiguru. That's the
  connection.

*Many Tantric deities do.  Why, I myself...
*well, let's stop here.

  But they are later.

  KaaraNDavyUha, in an early occurence
  talks of "Om maNi padme hUm" as the
  Avalokitezvara's mantra. Many other such
  occurences are later.

Best regards,
N. Ganesan
