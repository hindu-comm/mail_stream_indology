I wrote Avalokitezvara is the Hindu deity 'Siva in a Buddhist garb.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A. C. Soper writes 'Siva has a Buddhist alter ego Avalokitzevara.

Alexander C. Soper, Literary evidence for early Buddhist art in China,
Artibus Asiae publishers, 1959
p.59:

"; not, I think, by abrupt transition to a rival cul, but because
'Siva had probably been accepted for the time being in the
Cambodian Buddhist pantheon as a Bodhisattva, with attributes similar
in many ways to those of his Buddhist *alter ego* Avalokitezvara."

For many details, Soper's classic study is highly recommended.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
