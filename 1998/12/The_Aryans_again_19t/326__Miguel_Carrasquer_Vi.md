Correct.  My mistake, I had searched for "Mallory, J.P.".

Frankly, I don't think that's a meaningful title.  We can reconstruct
the PIE language, but I'm very sceptical of "Indo-European culture".

To take the analogy with English again: if we didn't have the Old
English documents, what would modern English vocabulary and
culture(s) tell us about the culture of the Anglo-Saxons of AD 500?
Not much, I think.
