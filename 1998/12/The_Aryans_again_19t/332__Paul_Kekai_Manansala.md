But does the Rgveda have any bearing on Indian demographic or other
history?

Why would you limit it to this time period?  Communication in Asia was
much the same in the late bronze age (if that indeed is the relevant
period) as it was until just several centuries ago.

This is indeed an overstatement.  Even the AI theorists are divided
about when "Aryans" entered India.  The Allchin's recent work on Indian
civilization clearly shows that even in the West there is growing doubt
about the AI theory (or even a mass migration theory).
