I never wrote this statement to Ashish Chandra.
>â€‰From the way he writes in Indology, will I ever
write a private e-mail to him like this?
He must be kidding. (unless I am totally crazy).

In the slogan provided by him there is no 'draviDa'.
In the last few days he sent unsolicited emails
most of which never had any reply back.
