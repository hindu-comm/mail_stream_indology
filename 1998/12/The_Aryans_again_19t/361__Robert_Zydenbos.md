This could very well be, if you are referring to something written in
Sanskrit.

The retroflex voiced fricative _l (also written "zh", etc.) has become
the retroflex lateral in modern Kannada and also in some Tamil dialects.
The retroflex lateral was given up in Sanskrit a very long time ago and
replaced by retroflex ".d".
