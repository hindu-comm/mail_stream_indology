Why don't you get a copy of one such textbook and then quote from there
wherein it is said that Bihar and Orissa were once part of North Pole. The
book, We, or our Nationhood Defined, is not in print anymore. If you have
one such copy, please let me know. I'd like to take a look at it.

     Dear Dr. Lars Fosse,

    P. Robb, The concept of Race in South Asia, Oxford UP, 1997, p. 342:

    "In order to make this point without contradicting prestigious
    predecessors such as Tilak, Golwalkar concedes that the 'Aryans,
    i.e., the Hindus, lived in the region of the North POle'.
    But he argues that modern palaeontological researches demonstrate
    the the North Pole is not stationary, and that 'quite long
    ago it was in that part of the world, we find, is called Bihar
    and Orissa at the present' [59]
    [59] Golwalkar, We, or our nationhood defined, p. 13.
    Interestingly, this theory has been introduced in the history
    textbooks in the States controlled between 1990 and 1992 by
    the Bharatiya Janata Party, the political front of the R.S.S."

    Robb's collection contains important essays. This looks like
    a sure case of zoologists teaching humble folk that
    all world's bulls descend from 'Siva's Nandin.

    Regards,
    N. Ganesan
