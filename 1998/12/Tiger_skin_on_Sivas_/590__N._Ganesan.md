Dear Indology members,

What are the occurences of Tiger skin/fur as
a waist dress for 'Siva Mahadeva?

Does Lord 'Siva wear this, according to Samskrit
texts? What about Sri Rudram, Matsya, Kuurma
and Skanda puraaNams?

Any quotes are highly appreciated.

Have a great 1999, the last year of the century.

With warm regards,
N. Ganesan
