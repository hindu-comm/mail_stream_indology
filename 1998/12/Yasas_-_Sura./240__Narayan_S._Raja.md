The words "sooran" and "veeran" (borrowed from Skt) exist
also in Tamil.  Perhaps the difference in their meanings
may be useful to you.

In Tamil, "veeran" means "hero".  "Sooran" can also mean "hero".
But "sooran" has some additional overtones of being victorious
or successful in an endeavour.  A loser could be a "veeran",
but in Tamil it doesn't sound right to call a loser a "sooran".
In fact, in Tamil another meaning of "sooran" is "a person who
is skillful, accomplished, or intelligent".

There are many dialects in Tamil.  The above information
may or may not be correct for all of them.

Regards,


Raja.
