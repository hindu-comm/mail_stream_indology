Your classification appears too contrived. Actually #1 and #3 are essentially
the same as they pertain to the process of logic (deductive or inductive).

#3 is not based on  any knowledge but  power of the person making the
statement.
4 is also arbitrary and in the systematic study of knowledge it falls under
the process of "analogy" which is considered the weakest form logic.

I dont think anybody has claimed that. As a matter of fact a mathematician,
Godel, has proved that there are certain propositions which are beyond
proof by mathematics or logic.

I think you are talking about the imposition of belief by the state but it falls
beyond any logic.

I do not see it as scientific humility but a case of split personalty of some
scientists who can compartmentalize their rationality. It seems many
capable scientists carry out excellent logical analysis to their chosen
discipline but fail to use it in their everyday life. In the language of  your
metaphor of sleep, some of us either never sleep or are never awakened
since they fail to experience any evidence or need of spirituality.
