This is not true. Creation as the cause of mankind's appearance on earth has
been around a long time. If this has to be debunked I would need a much
worthier opponent than evolution.

I beg to disagree. I was born and brought up a Christian, but I have
questioned my religion many times and have always found the answers.
Believing in creation does not make me a fundamentalist. You would be
surprised at the number of scientists that find the theory of evolution
lacking in scientific evidence. I can give you quotes and books but am
unable to do at this time so since I am enroute to India on vacation. If you
want a list of renowned scientists that believe in creation, I can provide
you with one on my return.

Evolution is just an effort by man to find an answer, but it is not *the*
answer. If it is the answer, we should have no problem explaining the duck
billed platypus or similar plants and animals.

Once again not true, since there are many in the scientific community that
find evolution scientifually and logically flawed.
