The Sanskrit MahAparinirvANasUtra (with its Tibetan and Chinese parallels),
ed. E. Waldschmidt, Berlin 1950-51, p. 410 (Vorgang 46.7) is quite clear on
this point:
First mentioning the "tailapUrNA ayodroNI" into which the body of the
king/Buddha is laid, and a second "ayodroNI" which is used as a cover, the
text says that the body is burnt and, thereafter, the bones (asthIni) are
put in a golden urn: "sauvarNa kumbha". This is the kumbha that later on
(51.17) is given to the brahmin who in the Pali MPS is called doNa and in
the Sanskrit version dhUmrasagotra.
