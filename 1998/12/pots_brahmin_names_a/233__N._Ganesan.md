At least "scholars" do not say Kannada is an offshoot of
Sanskrit.

Also, my post is lot more benign than what is said
of Shudras (eg., dharmasastras) in Sanskrit.
Prof. B. K. Smith's theory explains many things
more than insults, polemics, side tracks from the
most vocal Indigenous Aryan in INDOLOGY.

N. Ganesan
