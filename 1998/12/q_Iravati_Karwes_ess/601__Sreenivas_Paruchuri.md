Greetings all.

I understand that late Iravathi Karwe also wrote a series of essays on
_raamaayaNa_ which were published in a Marathi (?) magazine/journal
"satyaprabha". Were these ever translated into English (like her essays
on MBh, pblished under the title: yugaanta)?

Thanks and Regards,
Sreenivas

P.S. Re: my earlier query; Vaudeville & Sufism ... I didn't want to
(nor Vaudeville!) imply that "Sufism is the cause of 'bhakti' movement".
I am only looking for studies exploring the links between these two, how
both 'd have influenced each other.
