Indologists connected with Cambridge university:

Please make the book, A. Parpola, Deciphering the Indus Script, 1994
available in an inexpensive, paperback edition.

Right now, it is more than $100 and is beyond the reach of
most Indians. If widely available at an affordable cost,
this book will be a good reality check for many
politically motivated, home-grown theories of
Indigenous Aryans spreading out far into the West.

With kind regards,
N. Ganesan
