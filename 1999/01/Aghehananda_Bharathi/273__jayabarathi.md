              Professor Agehananda Bharathi was a well-renowned
        and knowledgeable person in the Tantras.
                He has authored a much-read work called
        "the Tantric Tradition" in 1964.
                Apart from this, he has also written, "The Ochre Robe",
        "A Functional Analysis of Indian Thought and Its Social Margins",
        and "The Asians in East Asia:JayHind and Uhuru". He completed "The
        Tantric Tradition" when he was in Kenya.
