The West has turned away from its Victorian values,
the Church dogma,.. Look at the TV, sexy websites, beaches, ...

But the Land of Kamasutra, Khajuraho, Konarak is
trying to get to the 19th century values of Islam or
Christianity.

Just like Indians have a special pleasure in questiong
Max Mueller's motives, I guess.
