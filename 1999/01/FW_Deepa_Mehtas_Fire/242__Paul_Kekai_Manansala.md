Usually a brownish-yellow color in Sanskrit that is often translated in
English as "tawny."

I think though that most see the major manifestations of Siva as rooted
in similar IVC deities.  So the idea of a Dravidian, or at least an
indigenous Siva seems to be supported.  Whether or not there are African
influences is debatable.  Mr. Hubey seems to have explored such possible
relationships.

The idea of Tantrism having at least some roots in Mahacina (Tibet,
Assam, Burma, China?) has also been explored. There are quite a bit of
Sanskrit references to the importance of Mahacina in the development of
Tantrism although I don't have any references handy at the moment.
