I'm afraid it is not their choice.  As the founder of this list I
collaborate closely with the actual list owners in Liverpool, who run the
computer side of things, and any decision about editorial policy is ours.

But anyone may start a rival moderated list elsewhere, naturally.  There
are already lists specifically for vyakarana and other topics, for
example.

All the best,
Dominik
