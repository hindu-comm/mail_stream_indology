Dear Martin or Krish,
Is there a text that can be recommended to an artist interested in being
introduced to Hindu astrology? Are the Islamic astrological observatories
such as the ones in Delhi and in Jaipur influenced at all by Hindu
astrological systems? Are there existing Hindu astrological observatories
(apart from temples) that are comparable?
Thanks,
Robert
