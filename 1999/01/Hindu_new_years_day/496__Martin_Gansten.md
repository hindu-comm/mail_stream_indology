Yes, you're right; apparently my previous statement was too hasty -- at
least partially. Balabhadra's Horaratna (a 17th century work, but based on
older sources) mentions that 'some' use tropical calculations to determine
the ayanas, but that this should not be done for ordinary purposes, such as
determining auspicious times. Here, Makara/Karka sankranti is used instead.
Obviously this is a survival from the time when these sankrantis really did
coincide with the solstices.

Best regards,
