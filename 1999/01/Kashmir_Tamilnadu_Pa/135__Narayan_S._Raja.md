However, sea travel was well-established
even in ancient days -- which means that
people could possibly have gone
directly between north and south India
without making an extended transit of
middle India.  A well-known example:
the Sinhalas of Sri Lanka are said to
have arrived -- by ship -- either from
Orissa, or from Gujarat, or possibly both.
