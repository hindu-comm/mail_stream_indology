The word tiliGga occurs in vAyupurANa also indicating a janapada.

According to the scholar-poet Arudra the word "teliGgaM" is the
name of sub-tribe of the tribe Gonds.

The word triliGga appears to be sanskritisation of that word tiliGga.
teliGga, tilliGga, tailiGga are also the variations of this word.

Thus in addition to Andhra, TriliGga or tiliGga is the name of telugu country.

Tamilians called them "vaDugar" and telugu country is called
"vDuga vazhi". The "vaDa nUl" studied by  the pAnDyan chief
"ten2n2am tamizavEL" have a (atleast a remote) chance of being
telugu books. This is because sanskrit already has been mentioned
and I do not think prakrit was on the decline by the 10th century
A.D.

So far an effort has been made to associate the words dhAnyakaTaka,
trikUTa, wi th the telugu country.
