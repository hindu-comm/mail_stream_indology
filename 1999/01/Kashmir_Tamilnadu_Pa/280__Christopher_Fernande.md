If I understand you correctly, you might have hit on the right
approach  to understanding VP 2.486.   Aren't you suggesting that
based  on your analysis of VP 2.485 and VP 2.486, there is no way
"parvata" can be semantically associated with "dAkSiNAtyeSu", and
that "parvata" cannot refer to a  person at all? Then, am I right
in assuming that, according to you, any  implication of
such association or equivalence reflects ignorance of proper
Sanskrit usage?
