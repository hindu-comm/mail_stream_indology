Dear Dr Zydenbos

I don't mean to be rude!  However, I thought that Dominik Wujastyk
made it quite clear that this 'The conversion issue' discussion
thread was to be closed!

You have since then just now sent 6 messages about it.  I'm sure you
have a lot to say on the topic, ...but this is rather over the top!
Please do stop!

Jibunnessa
