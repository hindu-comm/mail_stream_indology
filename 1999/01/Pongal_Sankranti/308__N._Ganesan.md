 AaNDaaL refers to preparations for Pongal day. I have
 to check the exact lines.

 pongal < Ta. verb 'pongu'
 tOcai < Ta. verb 'tOy' (Consider tOccal/tOyttal)
 uppumA = Ta. uppu + mA(vu)
 iTli < iTTaLi = iTTu + aLi (Each session is called IiTu)

 Does vaTai come from vaTu?
 Like koTuppatu > koTai, aTuvatu > aTai.
