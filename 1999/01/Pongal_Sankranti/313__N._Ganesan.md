Actually, Andal does not refer to the "Pongal" day,
but to the the preparation of sakkarai pongal (sweet
pongal) during the month of maargazhi (December-January)
before Pongal.  The day on which sakkarai pongal
is prepared is known today among Tamil Vaishnavas as
as "kUDArai vellum". Andal describes devotees of Vishnu
happily eating this pongal, sweetened by vellum (jaggery),
and so rich with ghee that it drips to their elbows
as they eat it.
>>>

  What does ANDAL say of Sakkarai pongal?
  Her lines please.

  Thanks,
  N. Ganesan
