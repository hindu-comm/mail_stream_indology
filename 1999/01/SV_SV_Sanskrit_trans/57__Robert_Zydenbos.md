Nazi scholars = those who committed themselves to a political ideology that
is detrimental to the advance of scientific knowledge

Indian scholars who do not agree to AI/M = those who do *not* commit
themselves to a view that is politically motivated and is not supported by
relevant scientific material

I don't think these two groups can be meaningfully compared. Try again.
