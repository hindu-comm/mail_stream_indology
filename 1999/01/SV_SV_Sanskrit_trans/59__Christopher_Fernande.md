In any field of scholarship, theory should be made to fit the
 facts and not the other way around. In a recent posting,
it was pointed out that Subhash Kak, one of the prominent
persons opposing the AIM theory, has chosen to ignore the facts
 which convincingly show that "Arya/Aryan" had a linguistic
connotation among Indians long before any of the
 Indo-European specialists appeared on the scene.  By ignoring
the above facts, he can continue to demonize the Western
scholarship as the  one who created the linguistic connotation
of Aryan. This kind of selective utilization of the facts to suit
 one's theory is downright unethical. How do you justify
what Kak has done?
