<<<
There is not even any manuscript evidence that the Gita was
interpolated into the Mahabharata, or at what time it was
done, if that were the case.
>>>

The Norton anthology quote given said BG was placed
in MBh in 1st century AD. There are NO mss. surviving from
that period in India. How can we expect mss. evidence?

NG> no line in nAlAyira divya prabandham of Alvars
NG> speaks of KRSNArujuna saMvAdam!!

<<<
The Alvars rarely repeat an entire myth. Their purpose
is not to retell stories, but to _use_ ideas from the
Puranas to illustrate emotion and aspects of Vishnu.
Therefore, their telling of stories will be very piecemeal.
>>>

Alvars tell, rephrase many myths repeatedly at various places.
But nowhere they tell that Krishna told Giitaa or Vaarttai
to Arjuna in Naalaayiram. That is significant given
the importance of Gita in Sanskrit tradition.

N. Ganesan
