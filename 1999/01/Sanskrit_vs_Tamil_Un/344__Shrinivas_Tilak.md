    In numerous postings to this list some scholars are passionately
motivated to demonstrate that a parallel Tamil universe exists beside
the Sanskrit one. But there is no need to play a game of one-upmanship
here. Indic universe is large enough to accommodate both and more. This
rivalry reminds me of the epic struggle between Vasistha and Visvamitra
in the Veda. Hopefully, scholars on both sides of this issue will not
provide fodder for those who are interested in reducing Hinduism to a
minority status in India.
