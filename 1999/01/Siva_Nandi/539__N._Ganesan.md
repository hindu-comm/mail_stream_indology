Dear Dr. Cohen,

Saw Nolamba images in Kramrisch before. What about Somaskanda in
Nolambavadi?

Do you know any Lingodbhava, Dakshinamurty, Ananda TaaNDava
NaTaraja or Somaskanda images further North?

Also, interested in other 'Siva mUrthams specific to the
Tamil cultural sphere. Apart from the above 4 ???

Many Thanks,
N. Ganesan

Ganesa,

I have seen Lingodbhavas and Daksinamurtis in Nolambavadi
(outside of Tamilnadu) during Nolamba period (mostly 10th c).  Lots
of Natesas too, though not exactly in the manner popular during the
Cola period.
