Dear Victor,
perhaps this is not exactly what you want, but an useful compilation of 28
essays (originally between 1902 and 1989), mostly philosophical, is
H. S. Prasad (ed.): Essays on Time in Buddhism. (Bibliotheca Indo-Buddhica
No. 78)
    Sri Satguru Publications (a Division of Indian Books Centre), Delhi
1991.
    ISBN 81-7030-262-5
It seems that the same author edited a similar collection of non-buddhist
material: Time in Indian Philosophy, of which I don't have the publication
data.
