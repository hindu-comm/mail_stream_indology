I wonder if Dr. Fosse, or anyone else well-acquainted with this subject,
would summarize for new list entrants, like myself, as to how this topic
achieved closure. In selectively reading the archives it appears to me that
more facts are needed for closure since both competing theories have
deficiencies.

Barring any new findings, this topic could be treated as a dormant subject
but definitely not a closed one. Any thoughts? BTW, I am not a scholar but
would like to be one.

Regards,

Krishna Kambhampaty
