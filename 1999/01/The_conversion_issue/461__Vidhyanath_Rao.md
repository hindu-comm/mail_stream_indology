May be this is because you are in India and don't listen to the likes
of Pat Robertson.

And how would you describe the organizations committed to
`deprogramming' (itself a loaded word: what is conversion and what
is programming) those who join `cults' (what is a cult and what is
a religion?)

Having spent half my life in India and half in US, the claim that
people in one place are inherently better than people elsewhere
rings hollow to me.
