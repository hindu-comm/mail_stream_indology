For scholarship to thrive, certain preconditions must be met: e.g., a free flow of information, and freedom of speech and the press. Freedom of conscience, freedom to discuss. These can indeed be considered political issues. We know what has happened to scholarship under totalitarian regimes that tried and try to obliterate these freedoms.

To speak up for such freedoms can be considered a very basic political deed, one that is (or at least: should be -- though postings on this list sometimes suggest otherwise) not controversial and supported by the majority of humanity.

E.g., when one senses that squashing a discussion in the name of being 'apolitical' would further a political development that is already underway.
