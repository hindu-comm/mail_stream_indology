"Siva Mahadeva, the Great God of Hinduism, has his origins
firmly rooted in India. He does NOT come from Africa,
Tibet or China.

Tantrism also has origins from the mystic traditions
of India. Tantrism did not arrive from Tibet, Africa
or China or Arabia or whatever.

More later.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
