Another thing on Taoism. Even before the formal beginning of Taoism,
the ideas of yin-yang and spiritual alchemy existed and are found in
works like the I-ching and the book of the Yellow Emperor.  By the
time both these books were written these ideas were already "ancient"
in Chinese culture.

Paul Kekai Manansala
