 Of course! I took on them for the last 5 years, check the
 archives- Frawley and various shadows of Frawley.

 I would say Aryan Migration. The varNa exploitation
 was not gentle at all. While coming in, it might have
 been gentle but not later. (I know Sanskritized Elites
 of India will have a different opinion).

 Regards,
 N. Ganesan
