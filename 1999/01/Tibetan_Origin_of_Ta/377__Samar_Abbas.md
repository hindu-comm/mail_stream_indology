Apologies for the `name-calling'. I didn't think I was too bad, because I
put it in quotes to shorten a longer description. Did not anticipate that
the phrase `Dravidianist' I used below would cause such pain. Apologies to
N.Ganesan if he felt offended at being called `Dravidianist'.

Don't mind Narayan S. Raja's joke comparing me to Ayatolla, though.
Keep them coming, Narayan! That was a good one :
