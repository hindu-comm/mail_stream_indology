Dear members of the list,

In front of me I have a short story in Hindi by Krishan Chander called
"saajhe kaa murdaa" (the jointly held corpse?). I would like to find the
Urdu version of the story, but don't know the title.

The first line of the story begins, "saaRhe caar baje ke kariib jab ki
biivii kamre me caay kaa pyaalaa le kar gaii to us ne bhargav ko apne
palang par murdaa paayaa."

Is there anyone out there who happens to know the title of the Urdu version?

Many thanks,

Ruth Schmidt
