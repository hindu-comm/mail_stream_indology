This banyan tree is said to have been in Himalaya mountains as per
the commentaries I have read.
What exactly is a "kal Al" (or "kal" banyan tree) as opposed
to the regular "Al" (or  regular banyan tree).
Does Banyan tree (the kal variety or the regular one,if at all
they are different) grow at any reasonable altitude
up the Himalayan mountains?
