*There is indeed the Marathi word bel (Skt. bela-) referring to the
*specific tree whose leaves are offered to Shiva, i.e. belapatra, and whose
*fruit are supposed to have medicinal properties.  But this obviously is
*different from anything like jasmine.
*                                                Madhav Deshpande

     I think Marathi bela- is called in Tamil as 'vilvam'.  /Selvaa
