Dear Sreenivas,

Pl. see:
Princess Gouri Lakshmi Bayi,
Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple,
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1995, 407 p.

The Princess Amma is a great art historian, often she
writes in The Hindu on Kerala temples very well.

Marthandavarma did a hiranyagarbha ceremony where
a huge gold vessel was donated off to the brahmins.
There is a large mural in the Royal palace of Trivandram
which is published in color in the BVB book.
The ceremony is detailed there, I think.

PathiRRup pattu, the history of Chera kings and other
sangam Tamil texts describe how the Tamil kings
sponsored several yagnas.

Regards
N. Ganesan
