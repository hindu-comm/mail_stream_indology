I had used a label that was misleading textually
but accurate conceptually for  the region.
The text simply says
"vanthEn kuta malai maangkaattu uLLEn"
[Have come I residing in the town of "maangkaatu" situated
in "kutagu mountains"]
kuta malai = kudagu (coorg) mountain
kuta or kutagu  means "west".
 "coorg" is derived from "kutagu".

The text does not use TuLu directly at all.
I apologize for the slip.
I cannot off-hand recall any references to TuLu in Sangam
era tamil texts. The text closest to that region that I know of that
Silappathikaaram mentions is
"karun-aatu" (interpreted to be "Karanatak") in
vanjchikkaaNtam.


 Other forum members might be able to help you
in this regard.
