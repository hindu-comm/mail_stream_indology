Long "E" is marked in Kannada script with a separate sign, looking like an
left-right-inverted 9. This dIrgha sign appears for the first time, to mark
a long "A", in an incription from Hampi dated 19.5.1561 (see P.-S.
Filliozat and V. Filliozat, Hampi-Vijayanagar, The Temple of ViThala,Delhi,
1988: p.81). It is attested for "E" in manuscripts of 18th century, but
rarely. It became current with printing.
