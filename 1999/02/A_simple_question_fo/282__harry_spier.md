"patra" or "pattra"

Monier-Williams on-line dictionary, Cappeller on-line dictionary ,
Bhagavad Gitas of Radhakrishnan and Winthrop Sargeant use "pattra"

Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary and the on-line dictionary site,
Bhagavad Gita's of Warrier, Divine Life Society, Swami Prabhupada use
"patra"

Same definition in all cases:  i.e. leaf, lotus etc.

If "patra" is correct and "pattra" wrong, does the written edition of
Monier-William's have the same misprint/error?
