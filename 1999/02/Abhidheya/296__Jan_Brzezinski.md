Venerable Indologists,

Would any Vedantists out there be able to explain why the word _abhidheya_ is used as the second member of the tripartite division of Vedanta theology (sambandha and prayojana being the other two). In my understanding, abhidheya is equated with sAdhana, but the word abhidheya itself does not immediately convey this sense.

Thanking you in advance,

Jan Brzezinski
