Dear Dr Ganesan,

You are lucky that I'm having this book with me ...

I went rapidly through it
but did not find anything
inside the text
that could fullfill
your desire ...

As for the 38 photographs contained in the appendix
I am not able to comment them

Best wishes

-- Jean-Luc CHEVILLARD (Paris)
