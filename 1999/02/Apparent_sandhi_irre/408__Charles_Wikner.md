Presumably that is transliterated as "tejo'Mzasambhavan".
However, two editions to hand that have the avagraha
(Sargeant, Sastry), have the bindu above the "jo" rather
than the avagraha.  Although this makes no difference to
the sound, is it in fact a typo (it seems odd to append
an anusvAra to an avagraha), or is it correct (in which
case the transliteration is asymmetrical).  Any offers?

Regards, Charles.
