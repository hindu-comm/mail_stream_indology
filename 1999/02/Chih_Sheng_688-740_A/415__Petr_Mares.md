I am sorry, but that is what I do not have here.

Do you have any explanation for this translation?


Since you mention the Indexes I would like to ask question related
to Taisho Indexes rather that to ZhiSheng:
Is it possible to find where the word la.Nka is mentioned (¾ãS)
 in Taisho? Is it in any work of Ü³æ©  Tan2 wu2chen4 hZ
Donmusen ?  (the names are coded in Shift-JIS)
Do you know about any solid evidence that Donmusen translated
the La.NkAvtAra sUtra? Are there any remains? Is there any
research in Japan on the above?

Wouldn't it that some of the descriptions found

I could be so.
