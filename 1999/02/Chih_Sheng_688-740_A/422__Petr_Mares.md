That is rihgt - GuangMing means bright in sense of shining. In fact
the Chinese mountain EMei Shan in Sichuan is called by
Buddhists GuangMing Shan due to the special phenomenon known
as Buddha's aureole - rainbow rings, produced by reflection of
water particles, attach themselves to a person's shadow in a cloud
bank bellow the summit. Devout Buddhist are reported to jump over
the cliff making suicide believing it is a call from beyond. There are
iron poles and and chain railings since the Ming dynasty there to
prevent these suicides.
