I am soorry to say Mr. Palaniappa that we were not discussing the
meaning of "vel" but of "gaungming". The multiple meanings of "vel"
do not in any way contribute to determining the meaning of word "gaungming".
Now we have "Gaungming mountain" is a direct translation of Sriparvata and
I think we can now progress.
