   Obscure, as usual.

  "Some cultures ... more .. write poetry" - Does this refer to China?
  "more manpower ... recursive coding" - Does this refer to India?

   If so, this is only a *subjectve* opinion, I am afraid.

   All Indian languages have beautiful poetry from ancient
   times comparable to any other on earth. eg., Sanskrit and Tamil.
   Chinese poetry getting well known in the West has more to do
   with money, lobby, Sinology well funded compared to Indology, etc.,

   Indian ability in Programming, nurtured by individual efforts,
   have the roots in ShulbasUtras, Zero concept,Aryabhatta, Madhavan
Nambudiri
   who invented Gregorian sine series several centuries before Newton,
   Ramanujan (FRS), Karmarkar (ATT Labs, Operations Research)....
