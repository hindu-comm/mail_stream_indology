Would anybody know if there exist discussion groups on the overseas trade history in the Indian Ocean / Bay of Bengal, from the beginning of the seventeenth up to the middle of the nineteenth century. This trade would involve equally the Western high seas trade as the indigenous intra-Asian sea trade.

Incidentally, I have received more than enough contributions on the Hindu concept of time, for which many thanks to all who cared to respond!

Yours truly
