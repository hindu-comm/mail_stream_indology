It is not a view but an absolutely basic requirement .
All the writers say that it is the abode of Tara and Avalokitesvara
and not of Siva or Dakshinamurty. Any place which is not primarily
a buddhist center is UNFIT to be considered as a candidate of Potala.

   CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY???

   You must mean Buddhist authors; of course, they
   won't reveal 'saivaite connexions. Is it not?
