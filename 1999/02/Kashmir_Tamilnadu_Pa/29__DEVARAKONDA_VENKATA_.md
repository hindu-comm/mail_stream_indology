I have never said any such thing. What I said is very clear & that is
you cannot claim a place to be Potala because of the presence of
Siva or Dakshinamurty. First of all it has to be a Buddhist center.
Or else generations of Buddhists cannot be expected to consider it
to be place of pilgrimage. Even if there is a connection between
Siva and Avalokitesvara it is clearly a later developement.
