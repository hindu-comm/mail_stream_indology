Dear Mr. Iyer

Mr. Ganesan was asking me, what is REALLY written in original of
Xuan Zang's geography (and other Chinese texts) about Malaya. I
am just trying to explain to him the difficulty to make definite
statement about words and their  authenticity in these texts unless
somebody specialize in one particular text. I am really sorry to
interrupt with jottings your discussion and thread which  I am not
following .

Sincerely

Petr Mares
