The foremost teacher of vajrAyana is from the Malaya country
where Mt. Potikai/Potalaka is.

I posted my reading from a book:
"Vajrabodhi and his disciple, Amoghavajra are from the
Potikai/Potalaka hills of the Malaya mountain range.
They lived in the Muulavaasam monastery (near Potikai)
in the 7th century AD.
Went to Anuraadhapuram, Sri Lanka and were important
teachers in Abhayagiri vihaara. [...]
Vajrabodhi was living at Kanchi and at the request of Pallava
King set sail off to China via Java.

Want to read the biography of Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra,
the founders of Tantric Buddhism in China and Indonesia.
References are highly appreciated."

Regards,
N. Ganesan
