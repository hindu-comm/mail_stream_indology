No offence intended, but could you
please post, in their entirety,
Prof. Yu's exact words, where she/he
definitely identifies Mt. Potalaka

Thanks in advance,

  No offence intended. Will dig up from boxes,
  & do it in a journal article. The selection
  of words from she/he and time of release will
  be my choice. Will you give me that option?

  Thanks,
  N. Ganesan
