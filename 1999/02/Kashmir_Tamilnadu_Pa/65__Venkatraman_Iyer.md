>Ceylon has been mentioned as a place where Avalokitesvara
>is there according to Lankavatarasutra.(lankAgiryAm)

  Are we sure Lanka in Lankavatara sUtra refers to Ceylon?
  I have not read this anywhere.

  Petr Mares thinks it is likely to be a South Indian text.
  What is the latest on the place of origin of Lankavatara?

  Does Lankavatara mention Avalokitezvara?

  V. Iyer
