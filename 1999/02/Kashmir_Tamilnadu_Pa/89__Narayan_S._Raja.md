Unlikely on the mountain itself
(it is over 20,000 feet high).
But all around it, certainly.
For a description, take a look
at: "Kailash Journal : Pilgrimage
into the Himalayas" by Swami. Satchidananda.

Also, remember, I din't say
it had be be only archaeological
evidence.  It can be some combo of
archaeological/literary/historical
evidence.

There is abundant archaeological/literary/historical
evidence that Saivites consider
Mt. Kailas to be a holy mountain.
And even to this day, Hindus
from India go on pilgrimage in Tibet
to Mt. Kailas and Lake Manasarovar.

Regards,


Raja.
