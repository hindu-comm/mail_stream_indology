Hello

Does anybody knows what is the oldest surviving Sanskrit and
Chinese (Taisho 670, 671, 672)  manuscripts of Lankavatara and
where it is located?

I would also like to ask if anybody knows about any current
research or translating of this sutra especially in the Chinese
version.

Sincerely

Petr Mares
