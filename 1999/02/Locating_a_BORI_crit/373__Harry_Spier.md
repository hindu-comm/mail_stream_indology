1) I am trying to locate a BORI critical edition Mahabharata in the New
York City area available for viewing by a member of the public.  In
particular the section containing the Bhagavad Gita i.e.
S. K. Belvalkar, ed., bhISmaparvan (1) (fascicule 15) (Poona :
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1947)  pp. 74 - 203.

2)  I have located an entry in the Oriental collection of the New York
Public Library for Srimadbhagavadgita /sanskrit text edited by S.K.
Belvalkar; Hindi translation by V. S. Agrawala
Imprint: Varanasi: Hindu Vishvavidyalaya Sanskrit Publications Board :
sole distributor, Banaras Hindu University Press, 1962.  Has anyone ever
examined this text and is it identical to the text presented in the BORI
edition?


Thank You


Harry Spier
