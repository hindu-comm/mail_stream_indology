 In what period, would this have been added? Any idea?

 In GaNDavyUha sUtra, Potalaka occurs for the first time
as the abode of Avalokitezvara.

 Chinese like to shorten Potalaka (Pu-ta-lo-chia) as
P'u-t'o. (cf. Chun-fang Yu, Prof. of Religion); Likewise,
In Tibet, Potala is a short form of Potalaka.
