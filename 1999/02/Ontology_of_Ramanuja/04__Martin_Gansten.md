Dan,

Thanks very much for the references; I'll try to locate them.

>In short, the world as acit has reality apart from consciousnesses because
>the  ultimate cause of materiality is Brahman, which is also the ultimate
>cause of consciousness (cit). Both cit and acit are produced from the same
>ultimate cause, while each operates within the causal dynamics of its own
>sphere. The material world functions through its own causal operations.

Is this a summary of Gupta's position, or your own understanding of Ramanuja?

Best regards,
Martin Gansten
