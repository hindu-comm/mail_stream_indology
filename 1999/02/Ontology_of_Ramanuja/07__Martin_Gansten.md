Robert,

>John Braisted Carman. _The Theology of Ramanuja._ Bombay: Ananthacharya
>Indological Research Institute, 1981. (Indian repr.; orig. Yale Univ. Press,
>1974.)

Thanks for the reference. Was it meant as an answer to my request for works
calling Ramanuja's realism into question? In other words, does Carman doubt
that R. was an objective realist?

Best regards,
Martin Gansten
