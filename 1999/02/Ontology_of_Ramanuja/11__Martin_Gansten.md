Thank you, yes. It is not, of course, a very thorough probing of R's
ontology, but then Carman does say that his study is limited to theology.
Still, it does point in the direction I am going: if the self is pure
consciousness, and the world is a mode of the self, then what does that tell
us about the world? Etc.

Thanks again,
Martin Gansten
