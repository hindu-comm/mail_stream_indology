>        - irregular case endings and compound forms, such as 'karme' for

>        - irregular (I think) words such as 'bhraatrii' for 'sister'
>        - excessive and superfluous use of the endings -vat and (more
>rarely) -mat, in words such as 'bhaagya-vihiina-vaan'
>        - erroneous gender inflections, such as 'sukhii' for 'sukhinii' or
>-vaan for -vatii.


Dear Martin,

the irregularities you quote do seem to be prakritisms. All of them (with
the exception of bhrAtrI) are mentioned in Franklin Edgerton's classic
Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Grammar and Dictionary, Vol. I: Grammar.

Yours,
Ferenc
