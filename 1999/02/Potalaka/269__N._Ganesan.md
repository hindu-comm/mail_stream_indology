 His [Hikosaka's] main linguistic argumentation has not yet been
 given by Kanecan,  namely that potiyil is allegedly derived from
 *bodhi-y-il, where "y"  is a gliding sound, "il" is a Tamil locative
 indicator and Tamil poti is allgedly derived from bodhi.

 I agree that the Tamil 'potiyil' has nothing to do
 with the bodhi tree.

 N. Ganesan
