Dear Sri Palaniappa,
                        We cannot identify Potiyil or for that matter any other mountain as
Potalaka on the basis of the praise showered by the local poets
on that. Even if we stipulate that the tamil poets considered Potiyil as
Mount Everest, that does not automatically make it Potalaka. I request the
people on this thread to confine themselves to facts suitable to the problem
and not on virtues of the places of their choice. Some people have been
waxing eloquent on the beauty of Malaya. We are not selecting a tourist
spot or Holiday Resort but a historical place. That can be done only on the
basis
of hard facts and their most probable inerpretation. I think that we can
ask for this because this will less taxing on the list members.

regards,
sarma.
