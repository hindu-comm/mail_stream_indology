How about Sabarimalai?  It fits the
description "GuangMing Shan" (shining mountain),

is the "makara jyothi" (a divine light
or radiance which, devotees say,
can be seen from a nearby mountain).

PS:  I have no opinion regarding Potalaka's
     location.  I'm just mentioning another
     candidate.
