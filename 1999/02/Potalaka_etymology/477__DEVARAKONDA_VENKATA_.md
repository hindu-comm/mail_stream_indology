Lighting a fire and brilliance are not the same. The word pottu has
the meaning of kitchen in tamil. In Tirumala the place where they
cook naivedyam for the diety is called "srIvAri poTTu".

Even assuming that the word pottu means brilliance,
once gaungming mountain is taken as Sriparvata, the etmology
of Potala is only of academic interest. Telugu people might have
called it Potala by the the neighbouring "etti potala".
Tamil buddhists could have reinterpreted it with a tamil etymology.
The existence of tamil etymological meaning does not make the
place tamilian. Multiple etymologies are not uncommon.
