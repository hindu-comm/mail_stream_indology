    ADDITIONALLY:

    Locating *malaya* as Mt. Potiyil/Potikai is possible.
    Literally, hundreds of such occurences can be found
    for *malaya* as Potiyil and *malaya mun2i* as
    Agastya. For example., in Kamban, Villi, Two TiruviLaiyADals,
    Kandapuranam, ...

    Using all the occurences in Tamil and Sanskrit, we can
    make a precise determination as to where Malaya is.
    That happens to be Mt. Potiyil as UVS & TVG have done.

    V. Iyer
----------------------------------------------------------
   CAminAtaiyar and KOpAlaiyar equate *Malaya* to Potiyil/Potikai.
   This is well grounded both in Sanskrit and Tamil traditions.

   CilappatikAram's usage of *malaya* as *potiyil*:
   a) malayattu OGki maturaiyin2 vaLarntu ...
   b) malayattu Ekutum vAn2 pEr imaya
      nilayattu Ekutal nin2 karuttu Akalin2 ...
   c) malaya mArutam tiritaru maRukil ...
   d) malaya mArutam man2n2avaRku iRukkum ...
   e) malayattu Aramum maNi muttu aaramum ...
   f) nItu nilai malayam piRpaTac cen2Ru AGku...
   and so on.

   CilappatikAram predates Manimekalai by a century or so
   and so there is really NO surprise in maNimEkalai using
   *malaya* as Potiyil and *malayattu arum tavan2* as Agastya.
