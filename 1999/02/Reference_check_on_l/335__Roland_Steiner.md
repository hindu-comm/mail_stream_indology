The line is identical with the wording adopted by Bevalkar in his
critical edition of 1947. In his critical apparatus he gives the
following variant readings:
dRSTvemAn : dRSTvemaM : dRSTvaitaan : dRSTvA saM- (sic) :
dRSTvaivaM; svajanAn : sujanAn : svajanaM; yuyutsUn : yuyutsuM
: yuddhAya; samavasthitAn : samupasthitaM : samavasthitaM :
samupasthitaan.
