> The text in question is a naa.diigrantha called Dhruvanaa.dii. It is
> definitely in Sanskrit (of sorts), not Prakrit, and of South Indian origin.
> I haven't the text with me at the moment, but I am working on another text
> very similar in style: Gurunaa.dii. Among the typical grammatical errors,
> the following may be mentioned:
>         - irregular case endings and compound forms, such as 'karme' for
> 'karma.ni', or 'pitaa-vipat' for 'pit.r-vipat'
>         - irregular (I think) words such as 'bhraatrii' for 'sister'
>         - excessive and superfluous use of the endings -vat and (more
> rarely) -mat, in words such as 'bhaagya-vihiina-vaan'
>         - erroneous gender inflections, such as 'sukhii' for 'sukhinii' or
> -vaan for -vatii.

I am not sure, but you may possibly find relevant info in the following book:

Damsteegt, T. (1978). Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit. Leiden, E. J. Brill.
