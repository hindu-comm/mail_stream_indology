Indologists:

Another  set  of  reasons  why  the  two  schools  of  Indian  MahAyAna
Buddhism  and  Advaita  VedAnta  belong  together  are:

1.  All  three  accept  two  levels  of  "truth".  PAramArthika  and
VyAvahArika  in  Advaita  VedAnta,  pariniShpanna  and  parikalpita  in
YogAcAra  Buddhism  and  paramArtha  and  samvRti  in  MAdhyamika
Buddhism.

2.  All  three  regard  the  world  as  NOT  having  absolute  reality.
