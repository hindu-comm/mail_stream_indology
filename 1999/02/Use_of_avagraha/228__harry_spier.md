Some western editions of Sanskrit texts occasionally use avagraha (or
double avagraha where appropriate) to indicate the assimilation of a
final a or A into a preceeding a or A.  In examining nine western
editions of the Bhagavad Geeta, it was seen that eight of them did this,
but none were self-consistent (the same word combinations sometimes
having an avagraha inserted and sometimes not).  Is this a modern or
western edition use of avagraha?  Is it more correct not to use avagraha
in this manner?

Any guidelines from professional Sanskritists would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you,


Harry Spier
