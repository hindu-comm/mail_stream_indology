Dear Mr. Hebbar,

>"if  everything  is  jnAnamayam  (consciousness)  how  can  ignorance
>be  possible  at  all?"  asks  Madhva.  (A  pretty  powerful  polemic  I
>think)

As you say, this argument is based on the equation of jnaana in the sense of
'consciousness' or 'cognition' with the sense of 'knowledge', i.e. 'correct
cognition'. I wonder what Madhva made of texts such as the Vishnupurana,
which speaks of bhraanti-jnaana 'erroneous cognition'? And did he agree with
Ramanuja's thesis 'yathaartham sarvavijnaanam'?

Regards,
Martin Gansten
