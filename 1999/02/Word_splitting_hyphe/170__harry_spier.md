Are there guidelines or accepted standards among Sanskritists for the
splitting of sanskrit sentences and the use of hyphenation in roman
transliteration.  In examining nine different editions of the Bhagavad
Geeta, each one split the words in the sentences differently, and each
one used hyphenation differently.  None mirrored the accompanying
devanagari script without additional breaks in the sentence.  Any
guidelines I could receive from professional Sanskritists would be
greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Harry Spier
