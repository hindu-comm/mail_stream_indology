Depends whom you ask.

For example, Samar Abbas has proved
that India is basically an Arab country
that drifted east by mistake...

Another prolific poster has shown,
with thousands of references, that
almost all Indian culture "trickled down"
from the waterfalls of Mt. Potiyil
(sorry, Potalaka) in Tamil Nadu...

Some Bengali poster might point out
that the Universe itself started
with the "Big Bong"...

Yours ignorantly,


Raja.

PS:  I personally think that the
     Hindi/Hindustani/Urdu language
     has been written in both
     Arabic and Devanagari scripts
     for hundreds of years.  But I'm
     not an expert.  Common sense
     isn't good enough.
