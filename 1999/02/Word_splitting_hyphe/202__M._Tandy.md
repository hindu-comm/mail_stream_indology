	You're probably familiar with Enzo Turbiani's article "The
Impact of Islam on TulsIdAs's Thought abd Poetical Work," in _Bhakti in
Current Researck, 1979-1982_ (Monika Thiel-Horstmann, Ed). Turbiani
discusses TulasI's use of Persian and Arabic terms, found especially in
his KavitAvalI. Of course, TulasI employed Sanskrit too.
