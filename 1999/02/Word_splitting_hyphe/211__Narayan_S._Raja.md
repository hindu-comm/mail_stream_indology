So is bread.

They also eat a lot more bread
than the chappati- or idli-eating
Indian hoi polloi.

Yup.  We should all give up
our idlis and eat bread.
Fortified with iron and
essential minerals, easy
to mass-produce and store
unlike idlis, it is simply
the most efficient way to

Eating idlis is outdated imperialism.

Thanks, Chris, for that insight.


Raja.
