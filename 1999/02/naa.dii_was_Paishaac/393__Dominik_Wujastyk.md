Dear Martin,

I had a quick search through the following medical texts:
Susrutasamhita
Carakasamhita
Bhavaprakasa
Sarngadharasamhita
Astangahrdaya

and apparently the term does not occur in classical ayurveda.  Of course
"netra" and "krimi" occur a lot separately.  But not the syndrome.  I'm
surprised, and if I have time, I'll recheck my search.

Best,
Dominik
