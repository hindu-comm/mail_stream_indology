               By Our Special Correspondent TIRUCHI, Feb. 26.

               The care taken by the Chola kings during renovation
               of temples and how scrupulously they copied the
               inscriptions on the dilapidated portions on the newly
               constructed portions after renovation have come to
               light, the discovery of old and new inscriptions on
               the walls of the Perumal temple in Natham village,
               near Pullambadi, about 40 km from here.
