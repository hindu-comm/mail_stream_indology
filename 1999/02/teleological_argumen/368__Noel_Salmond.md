Esteemed Indologists

Several nineteenth-century Hindu reformers invoke a form of the
teleological argument; to wit, that knowledge of God can be derived from
observation of the order and design of the universe.

Where are there precedents for this in the Indian tradition? Is this a
borrowing from European Deism?

Thanks in advance for any pointers.
