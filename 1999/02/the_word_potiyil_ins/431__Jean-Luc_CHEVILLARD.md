Dear Swaminathan Madhuresan,

it will take a little time to check everything.
For a starter, here is the answer for puRam,
blindly based on the _Index of Puranaanuuru_
that was published in 1962 by V.I.Subramoniam (University of Kerala)
(I do not [dare to] check)

potiyil = public hall (ampalam)
 52-13
 375-3
 390-19

potiyil = the mountain Potiyil
 128-5

potiyam = the Potiya mountain
 2-24

 [... to be continued ...]
