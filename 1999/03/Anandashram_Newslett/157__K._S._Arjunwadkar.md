Announcement
We are happy to announce that Anandashram Newsletter 3 (March 1999) is almost
ready for despatch to list members who have already given their postal
addresses. Those who wish to have a copy but have not registered earlier are
requested to give their postal addresses at the e-mail address given below.

We are also happy to announce that two spacious guest rooms, along with a
decent toilet room, have been refurbished out of the space in the Institute's
premises lying unused for decades. They are meant for the use of those who
come
to Pune for Sanskritic studies. For further details, contact Manager on the
postal address given below or the e-mail address <panini at pn2.vsnl.net.in> of
