Following the editor-in-chief Sukthankar, the editors of the Poona text
uniformly omitted (or attempted uniformly to omit) word-internal
avagrahas. The errata to the Adiparvan, for example, contain at least four
cases where Sukthankar corrects a word by removing such an internal
avagraha. There are a few cases which got into print by mistake, but by
and large the spelling without avagraha is standard throughout the
edition.
