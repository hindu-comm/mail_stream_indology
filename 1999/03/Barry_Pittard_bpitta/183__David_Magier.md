I'm an Australian who has spent a number of years in India serving in
academic and social service areas.

I'm slowly exploring the topic of naadis, the predictive readings on
palmyra (or palm) leaves purportedly authored by great ancient sages -
such as Brighu, Shuka, Shukra, Agasthya, Kousika, Koumara, Kakbhusandi,
Bhoga, Pullipani, Vashista, Vishwamitra, etc.

Even the slightest bits of information help me to "jigsaw" a larger
picture together. I want to make contact with anyone who knows any shred
of information about these leaves - addresses of naadi jyothishas
(readers), and experiences - convincing or otherwise - of any one who
has ever consulted these leaves.
