Sorry for asking what may be a very basic question, but historical geography
is not my forte: in a text which I am assuming to be no earlier than the
17th century (possibly later), I find mention of a certain brahmin named
so-and-so who lived 'in the district of Kerala' (kerale vi.saye). Could
anyone tell me how well this term may correspond to the present Kerala
state? Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Martin Gansten
