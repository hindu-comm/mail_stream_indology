Dr. Kalyanaraman:

I've no idea how to predict older forms. Re the language of the
Indus/Harappa civilization, it may be important, I think,
to understand the relationship of Dravidian with ancient Sumerian,
Elamite, Egyptian, Old Iranian and
later Greek-Latin. There appears to be connections (borrowing of words
and ideas both ways, as well as trade). Elamite may be related to
Tamil/Dravidian. These connections are not well studied, it appears.
It may have a bearing on this issue.
