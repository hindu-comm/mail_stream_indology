I have been trying to locate a copy of the following title, published by the
Südasien-Institut, Heidelberg:

Jyotisa : das System der indischen Astrologie [Jyotisa : the system of
Indian astrology] / von [by] Hans-Georg Türstig. - 1980. XVIII, 343 p. ISBN
3-515-03283-5 

It is no longer available either from the Südasien-Institut itself or from
the Franz Steiner Verlag, where I was directed. Would anyone on the list
happen to own a copy or know where I could obtain one?

Many thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
