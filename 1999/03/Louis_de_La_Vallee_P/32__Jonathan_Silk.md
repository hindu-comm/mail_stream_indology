This is of course nothing more than an English translation of the
remembrance published by M. Lalou and J. Przyluski. I don't have the
original publication details at hand, but everything should probably  be
found in the volume of the _Bibliographie Bouddhique_ in which the complete
bibliography of LVP is found (again, my copy is not by me now, but if
necessary I can get the reference if someone else does not supply it
sooner).  In fact, it may be there that the remembrance was published...
