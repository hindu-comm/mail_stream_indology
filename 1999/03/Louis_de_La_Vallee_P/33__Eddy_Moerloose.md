>> Louis de La Vallee Poussin, an ancestor of mine, was very well known
>> in the field of Sanskrit translations, as well as Oriental Buddhism
>> and a variety of other related subjects.

>> I am having a lot of trouble finding his biography or resume.  All I
>> have is a list of publications, and even that is incomplete.
>>
>> Would you know where I might go to find more information on him - not
>> just his achievements in his fields of research, but also where he
>> was, whom he taught, who he was taught by, where he lived, marriages,
>> children etc etc so that I can tie it back into the family tree?

>> Many thanks,
