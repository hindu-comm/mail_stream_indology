It is interesting that Manjusrimulakalpa was discovered at
MaNalikkara MaTam near Padmanabhapuram, very close to Kanyakumari.
Its editor was T. ganapati sastri at Thiruvananthapuram.

I have read that Manjusrimulakalpa is one of the very few
Buddhist texts to be found in India; Many Buddhist texts have
been recovered from mss. elsewhere (Central Asia, Tibet, China,
Japan, Nepal & so on). Is this true?

Regards,
N. Ganesan
