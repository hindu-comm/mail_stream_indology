Zvelebil, Dravidian Linguistics, Pondicherry, 1990, p. 9 refers to Burrow
(1938), but does not list this reference in his bibliography. According to
L.S. Ramaiah's bibliography of Dravidian languages and linguistics, Burrow
published in 1938: "Dravidian Studies I, Bulletin of The School of
Oriental and African Studies (BSOAS), University of London, pp. 711-722.
