It's not so much a question of authority as of usage. (I am here going to
use "pure" Harvard-Kyoto ASCII: "M" means anusvara, "&" means
candrabindu.)  Whitney, for instance, notes that the normal MS usages are
"trIMlokAn" or "trI&llokAn", and suggests that a "better" usage would be
"trI&l lokAn". (Grammar, 206a.) He also states that, "according to the
Hindu grammarians", final *m* before l- becomes a nasalised "l", in
exactly the same way as happens to final -n (71, 206, 213d) -- so that the
use of anusvara for -n is "just as reasonabl[e]" as for -m. Nasalisation
is a notoriously difficult area, and I'd be interested to know what "the
Hindu grammarians" do actually say here, since Whitney is not the most
reliable witness; but there is no reason to mistrust his comments on MS
usage. Indeed, the sandhi -n + l- -> -M + l- occasionally finds its way
into print -- there's an example in one or other of the Brahmana paasages
in Boehtlingk's Chrestomathie, for instance, though a rapid search fails
to locate the exact spot.

I presume you mean tatpuruSa, not bahuvrIhi.
