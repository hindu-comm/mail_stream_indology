Here are some semant. which may relate to river:

pe_n.am = care, nurture (Ta.); 

punal = water, river (Ma.); pol.e = river (Kod.agu); oyl. = waterfall in
channel or river (Kota); pin-n-al = braiding (Ta.)[van.ar = to curl as the
hair]; bani = a current of water caused by heavy rain (Malt.); levni = river
(Gondi)

vanta = rivulet (Naikr.i)

Regards,
Kalyanaraman
