Dear colleagues

I have lately been wondering the following question. Moniew Williams
in his dictionary occasionally refers to Wilson's dictionary. This is
understandable as Wilson's Dictionary was compiled by a team of
pandits and a word or meaning culled from there may represent oral
tradition of Bengali pandits. But the question is, what did MW mean,
when he referred to the first edition of his own dictionary. Had he
forgotten, where the word was taken into the dictionary or what?

Regards
