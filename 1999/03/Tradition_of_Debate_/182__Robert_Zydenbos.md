B.K. Matilal has written about "Rule of Dialectic and Debate" in his _Logic,
Langauge & Reality_ (sec. 1.2). It seems that the first authors on this
topic were Jainas and Buddhists, and the Nyaaya school used the same terms
in slightly different senses; being more systematic, the description in the
Nyaayasuutra came to carry more weight (ibid.).

development take place?) Which period we you thinking of, more precisely,
and what kind of examples?
