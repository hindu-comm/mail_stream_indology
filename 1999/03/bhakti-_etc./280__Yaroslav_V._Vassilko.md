Dear colleagues,
I would be most grateful for references to different etymologies of the words:
*bhagavat*, *bhakti*, *bhakta* (even to those that you think are wrong) and to
different ideas on the history of their semantics.
     Thanks in advance,
                                Yaroslav Vassilkov
