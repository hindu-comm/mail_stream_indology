Dear Yaroslav,

Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya has a well argued out suggestion: the root of the
concept would be bhaga, share, i.e. sharing in the tribe's affairs, first of
all participating in the redistribution system. Unfortunately I do not have
his book (Lokayata. A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism, New Delhi, ca.
1957) at hand, so I cannot be more specific. As he was [or is? I really
don't know] an enthusiastic communist, most probably his work has been
translated into Russian.

Yours,
Ferenc
