The Library of Congress has two Malayalam versions of the
Halasyamahatmya, which it identifies are from the Skandhapurana.  Do
you have any idea where if anywhere in published versions of the
Skandhapurana it might appear?  Of course, many works claimed to
belong to the SP are isolated works and not found in mss or printed
versions of it.

Does anybody have access to the Sanskrit texts, hAlAsyapurANa and
hAlAsyarahasya? I need a few lines from those texts. You can reply to
me off
the list. Thanks in advance.
