Some papers on the concept of Axial Age (in relation to India and the world in
general) have been published several years ago in the first (?) issue of
the materials of a symposium or conference on the Date of The Buddha.
Unfortunately, I am not able to give the exact reference now.
All the best,
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
