   Is the translation right? nAL kaL = nATkaL = fresh toddy.
   naL could refer to day or night. (or, the adjoining lines
   may make it to morning. Is it so?)

> + we also meet with "naL en2al", like in
>  naL en2 kaGkul (8 occ.) "in the dead of night" (A.K.Ramanujan
>1967:92)
>  naL en2 yAmattu (11 occ.) "in the night" (ibid. p.77)

   "naLLiTaic cAkilan2; pakaliTaic cAkilan2"; Here,
   Kamban uses unambiguously 'naL' as 'night'.
