For the other cUttiram, maka [magha] naks2atra was cited as an example.
Note here that nAL here more specifically means daily lunar asterism.
nAL mIn2 [astral body] vs. kOL mIn2 [planetary body].

In addition to the places I have quotes already, the following very
unambiguously indicates the usage of nAL in the sense of night:
kuRuntokai: 145.3-5
"... pAn2AL
tuJcAtu uRainaroTu ucAvAt
tuyil kaN mAkkaLoTu neTTirA uTaittE".

"[this town] ...has long nights that are full of beings with sleepy
eyes that do not care to enquire [about the welfare of] those who are
sleepless at midnight" [rA.Raghava Iyengar]

pAn2AL = pAl nAL = divided night  = mid night
neTTirA = neTTu irA = long night
