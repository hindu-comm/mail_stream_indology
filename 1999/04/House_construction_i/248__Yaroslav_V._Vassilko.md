According to the old book by E.Mackay (Early Indus Civilization. L., 1948),
the builders of the Indus major cities (MD and Harappa) used as a rule pure
solution of silt (without any additions of other gluing substances). It
could hold the bricks in their places, but could not prevent them from being
taken out for secondary use by local people in later times. In some specific
cases (as, e.g., in the facing of sewage tubes) the solution of lime or gypsum
(pure, of mixed with silt) was used.
