Let me thank Drs. Vidyasankar and Ganesan for bringing up this topic
and of course Ellen, who knew it all along (I missed her earlier
response). Ellen, my coin (shown on webpage) does not have Makara
visible, it almost entirely out of flan. Can you tell me a reference
where a photograph of coin is shown and atleast a part of Makara
is visible? Alternately, if you have any such photograph, I would
be glad to receive a copy of it.

Best wishes,

Nupam
