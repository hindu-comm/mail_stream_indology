Dear Mr. Ganesan,
        don't you think that your remark may provoke one more fruitless
irrational discussion?
        And after all, they are just single signs, most probably owner's
marks, or potter's marks. Who can say anything about their language?
        All the best,
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
