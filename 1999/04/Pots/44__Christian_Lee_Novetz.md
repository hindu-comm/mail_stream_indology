Thanks for the suggestion.  I had done this (and reread my own posting of
several months back about Namdev and Gora) but what I really need is some
article or another.  I need such a source because I am presenting a paper
soon and, before I do so, I need to offer my listeners (not India
specialists) some discussion of the significance of pots in Hinduism for
them to read before hand.

I'll go through the archives again in case I've missed anything.

Thanks.

Christian
