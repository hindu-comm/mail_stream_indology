I have a simple question:

Is it possible/feasible to argue in relation to the Rgvedic texts,
that text provided the basis for tradition rather than the other way
around ?  If tradition and text are viewed in relation to the
historical process of production,  and social forms of
contextualisation,  interpretation and certification then surely the
Rgveda tells us more about the socio-political millieu in which it was
first written down then about the situation in the protohistoric past.
 Therefore is it even a worthwhile exercise to look for remanents of
Rgvedic culture in archaeology?
