I simply mean that publication of an English translation of your work in
Hungarian would be theoretically accessible to a larger audience. Sadly,
even work published in French or German remain unread by the vast majority.
And there are not that many scholars interested in Samkhya any more, except
in relation to other systems. Still, it may be worth the effort.
