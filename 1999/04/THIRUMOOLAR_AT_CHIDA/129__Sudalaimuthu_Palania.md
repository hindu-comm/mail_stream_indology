I do not know what you mean by authenticated information. But according to
periyapurANam tirumUlar visits tillai before he reaches AvaTutuRai.
periyapurANam also says that he lived for 3000 years and went to kailaza and
reached ziva's feet.

There is no textual evidence that he died at Tillai.

Since cuntarar mentions tirumUlar, tirumUlar cannot be later than 8th
century. But his mention of pon2man2Ru in the following poem may be
attributed to the possibility that this section may not have been part of the
original tirumantiram. There is no critical edition of tirumantiram.
