> I would suggest that nala is Middle Indian from Sanskrit nada
> "roaring".

 For taking nalagiri as coming from nadagiri 'roaring mountain'
instead of 'black mountain', grateful thanks for guidance:
a) does 'nala' occur in the sense of 'roaring' in MIA?
b) does nadagiri or nAdagiri type usages for elephants occur
Sanskrit literature?

'naLagiri' elephant is compared to 'big, black mountain' in the Tamil
version of bEhatkathA.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
