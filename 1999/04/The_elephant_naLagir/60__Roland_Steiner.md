These examples have to be judged separately.
-- Pkt. kalamba seems to be derived from Skt. ka.damba > Tam. 
ka.tampu, Kan. ka.damba, etc. (cf. Turner CDIAL No. 2710; Mayrhofer 
`Kurzgefasstes etymologisches Woerterbuch des Altindischen´ i 
144, s.v.). Cf. also Pkt. kaamba > Skt. kadamba.
-- Pkt. duvaalasa (Skt. dvaada"sa). In Pali representation of d by r 
(through .d) is quite common in the compound numerals with dasa 
`ten´ (e.g. ekaarasa `eleven´ beside ekaadasa; baarasa `twelve´ [dv- 
> b-), cf. Geiger § 43.1. According to the following § 44, a secondary r 
originating from d alternates with l in telasa/terasa `thirteen´.
-- According to Mayrhofer ("Etymologisches Woerterbuch des 
Altindischen" ii 58, s.v.) the etymology of Skt. nod "to push" is "not 
clear". Cf. also lu.dati `stirs´, nu.dati `strikes" (CDIAL No. 11080).

Be that as it may, in the general development of Indo-Aryan 
intervocalic -d- of the early Middle Indian stage (Pali) does not 
remain (except in European Gypsy and Kalaa"sa which keep -t- and -
d- as l; cf. R.L. Turner, `Collected Papers 1912-1973´, p. 239; 
moreover, in his commentary to Gaandhaarii Dharmapada 330, 
Brough considers a `sporadic appearance of -l- for intervocalic -d- < - 
t-´ for the Gaandhaarii), whereas -.d- regularly becomes -.l-.

See also Heinrich Lueders (Philologica Indica, p. 555), who 
compares the old king's name Nala (according to him originally 
"cane" [still Na.da in "SB. 2,3,2,1.2]; cf. naa.dii, naala, nalina, etc.) 
with names like Ve.nu etc.
