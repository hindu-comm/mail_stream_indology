 Vishnu sleeps usually in the Ocean of Milk, how do we reconcile this?

Is it because nala is a Dravidian word not understood in IA?
They might have taken it as reed. But hard to explain nAlAgiri with reeds.
In A.P., nalla (<naL-) malai mountains (Black mountain) are there from which
River Krishna flows. Tamil Perungkathai has an elephant called
naLagiri.

Thanks,
SM
