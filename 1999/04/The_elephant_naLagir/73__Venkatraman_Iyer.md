Quite interestingly, the PED notes two instances when aGjana is
 used in the meaning of 'ointment-tube, collyrium-box'
(aGjana=aGjana-nALi - TherIgAthA 413, Dhammapada-aTThakathA II.25).
Was also nALI/i ('a hollow stalk, tube, pipe') used to mean
 'ointment-tube, collyrium-box'? With its suggestion of
blackness?

 Some reeds and stalks are black in color, esp. inside.
 Could nALi refer to such black stalks?
