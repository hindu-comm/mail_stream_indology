Hello,
        Here is an interesting discussion of Thugs in India.
        I just purchased a fascinating book by Stewart Gordon: Marathas,
Marauders, and the State formation in Eighteenth-Century India, Oxford
India Paperbacks, 1998 (originally published in 1994 by OUP).  The first
chapter of this book deals with Thugs: "Scarf and Sword: Thugs, Marauders,
and State-formation in Eighteenth-Century Malwa".
        Best,
                                Madhav Deshpande
