>The "epigraphist" S. Paranavitana is totally untrustworthy.

This is simply not true, and to call him a "scientific fraud" is in fact
outrageous. That later in his career he more or less lost his mind is
plain, as Rocher so *tactfully* showed. The crucial question is just when
this decay began. But there can be no question that his earlier -- and the
definition of this word them becomes crucial-- earlier work is entirely
reliable, and in many cases definitive.
