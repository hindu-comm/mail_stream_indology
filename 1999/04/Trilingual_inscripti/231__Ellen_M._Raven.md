Adding to the several objections to the above statement, I would like
to point out, that to call S. Paranavitana a scientific fraud is not
only an insult to him and to Sri Lankan archaeology, but also to
Paranavitana's supervisor at Leiden University, the eminent
Sanskritist, epigraphist and art historian Prof. J. Ph. Vogel.
