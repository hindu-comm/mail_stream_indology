Seeing the problems and some 'illnesses', I wonder
how the inscriptional material relating to Tamils
was handled by S. Paranavitana & co.? For instance,
in the oldest Brahmi inscriptions from Ceylon,
are there any presence of Tamil or Tamils?

Pali scholars were producing books in Kaveri delta.
Due to the bhakti movement in Tamil lands in 6th-10th
centuries, Buddhists would have left for Ceylon and over
time became Sinhala speakers? Have scholars of Buddhism
taken a look at the complex interactions fuelled by
religious rivalries?

V. Iyer
