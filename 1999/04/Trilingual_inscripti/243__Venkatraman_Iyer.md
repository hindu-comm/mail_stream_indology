Where did Paranavitana go to college for an undergraduate degree?
Usually any PhD thesis will have it at the last page.
Who were his PhD committee?

Coming to know of the problems, 'illnessses', etc.,
did he present the data about Tamils in early brahmi
inscriptions of Ceylon truthfully and adequately?

Pali authors were working in Kaveri delta. After
the success of bhakti movements by Srivaishnava Alvars
and Saivaite Nayanmars, Tamil Buddhists would have
left for Ceylon from 6-7 the cent. and later, became Sinhalese
over time. Have the complex interactions between Ceylon
and South India looked into in Indological scholarship?
Religious rivalries and accommodations.

V. Iyer
