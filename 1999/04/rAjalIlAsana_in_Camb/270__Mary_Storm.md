> rAjalIlAsana is the posture with one leg either freely hanging
>  from a couch or in a cross-legged fashion while the other leg
>  is raised up forming a V-shape and this raised foot is set on the
> couch, Often, the hand is resting on the knee of the lifted leg.

> Cambodia had a King Mahendravarman almost at the same time
> as Pallava Mahendravarman. Their titles were citrasEna and
> citrakArapuli respectively. Jean Boisselier says Khmer
> art was highly influenzed from the art of South India.
> Hence, my question:
> In Cambodia, have any avalokitezvara and/or Shiva sitting in
> rAjalIlAsana ever found??

> Thanks a million for guidance or sources,

>
> Related: I saw a Gupta period Shiva sitting in rAjalIlAsana.
> Except this rare exception, almost comparable to rare Skanda
> sculptures from Guptan age, I do not know avalokita or siva
> sitting in rAjalIlAsana. Are there any r. Shiva or Avalokita
> from Bengal, U.P., Bihar, Kashmir, Nepal, Tibet, Central Asia?
