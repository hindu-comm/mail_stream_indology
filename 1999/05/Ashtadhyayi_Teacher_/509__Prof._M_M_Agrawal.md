Dr. Allen  Thrasher  had asked about availibility of a tutor of
Ashtadhyayi at delhi for his friend. I suggest that he should go to
 Deptt. of Sanskrit, Delhi University, Maurice Nagar, Delhi-7 and
contact
Prof. Avanindra Kumar, Professor of Ashtadhyayi. He will be very helpful
to him. He will suggest him properly.
 Hope I have been of some help.
 Best regards,
 Madan Mohan Agrawal
 Prof. of Sanskrit,
 Delhi University
