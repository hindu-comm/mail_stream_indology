For the record, a many Indo-European cultures have no record of their migration
into their historical territories. Such records are lacking for Greece, Italy,
Anatolia, and also for the Scandinavian countries. Not all ancient peoples were
equally concerned with their geographical origins. Therefore, the non-mention of
such migrations in the Vedas is not so important as some assume it to be.
