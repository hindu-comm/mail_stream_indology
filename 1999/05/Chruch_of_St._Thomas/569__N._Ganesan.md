Thanks for the reference, Vishal. Most likely that
no material predating 16th century exists for Thomas' martyrdom
near Chennai.

There is a text of a copper plate inscription from 345 CE!;
Its translation is mounted on the web by Prof. Ninan; "Supposed"
to be from 345 A.D. If true, it could be very important to Keralan
history. The problem is that Ninan's version lists 72 honors
given to St. Thomas of Canaai; This list is typical for
Nayak period; *Definitely* not for 345 CE. Check it with any
epigrapist or historian of South India.

N. Ganesan
