   This "neglect of a rigorous study of Sanskrit literature"
cannot be said for Prof. Thompson; my friends tell that
GT got his Doctorate from UC, Berkeley on Vedic Sanskrit.
Among GT's many publications on vedas, I particularlt enjoyed
a) On Truth acts in Vedic, IIJ, 1998
b) Ahamkara and atmastuti, HR, 1997
c) The brahmodaya and vedic discourse, JAOS, 1997
d) From 'footstep' to 'word' in Sanskrit, Semiotica, 1995

Your blaming is incorrect in this case, I am afraid.

Regards,
V. Iyer
