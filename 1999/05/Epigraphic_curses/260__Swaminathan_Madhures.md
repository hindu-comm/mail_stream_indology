Not only the Nayak period inscriptions, but the imperial
Chola and Pandya ones as well to get a full idea.

Also, the curses by 'Saivaite Nayanmars on Jains and Buddhists,
usually in 9th quatrain of every decad. Vaguely remember these
curses figure in maNimEkalai, the buddhist epic too.

Kind regards,
SM
