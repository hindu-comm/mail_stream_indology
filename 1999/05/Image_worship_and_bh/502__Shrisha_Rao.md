A reference that may be useful in this regard is `Agamas and South Indian
Vaisnavism', by V. Varadachari (Madras : Prof. M. Rangacharya Memorial
Trust, 1982, BL1141.46 .V37 1982).  The author gives a fairly
comprehensive survey of the Pancharatra literature as found today with
special reference to its role in determining worship practices.  F. Otto
Schrader's `Introduction to the Pancharatra and the Ahirbudhnya Samhita'
(Adyar Library, Madras) remains the classic on the subject more than
eighty years after it was written.  The Sanskrit introduction to the
Lakshmi Tantra (published by the Adyar Library in 1959) is useful also;
however, a comprehensive study of the Pancharatra literature is still very
much a desideratum.
