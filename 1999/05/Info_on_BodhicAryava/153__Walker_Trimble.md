Two years ago I read the Bodhichaaryavataara in a class with Prof. Richard
Gombrich.  All of us in the class agreed that the translation of Kate
Crosby and Andrew Skilton under OUP, 1996 was quite good.  As I recall,
they kept to the Sanskrit version and only resorted to the Tibetan
translation when necessary.  On my part, I find the style a little too
informal.
