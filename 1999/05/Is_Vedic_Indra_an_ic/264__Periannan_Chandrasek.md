Dear Indologists,

Based on Vedic texts or early "Aryan" texts,
 is it possible to  accurately say that
Indra, as the lord of the agricultural land rich in water bodies,
was also an icon of sexual promiscuity  and infidelity?

If not so, what is a reasonable time frame for the
earliest Skt texts that would qualify Indra to be one?


Regards,
Chandra
