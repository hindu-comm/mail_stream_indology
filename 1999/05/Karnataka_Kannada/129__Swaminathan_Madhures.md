naTu = to place; nATu = a place, this type of pairs
are many; Eg., viTu (to leave) & vITu (=home, mukti).
I think naTu and nATu come from the same semantics,
hence, "kannaDa" may also point to "kannADaka".

In this connection, naL-(black) and nAL- (eg., nAL miin2, night star)
are worth considering.
