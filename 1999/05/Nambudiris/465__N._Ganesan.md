Dear Prof. Maheswaran Nair,

Welcome to Indology list.

I read in Indology some time ago that Nambudiris hail
from Mahrashtra. Prof. Madhav Deshpande wrote then;
Both Konganastha Brahmins and Nambudiris have the same
kuladeyvam temple - somewhere in Konkan. (I need to check
the archives for correct quotes).

Did Nambudiris arrive in Kerala from Maharashtra region?
When? 5th century?

Thanks for your answer,
N. Ganesan, PhD
