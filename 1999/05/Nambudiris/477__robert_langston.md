Dear Dr. Ganesan and Indologists,

Next door to the rectory, out behind the Church of St. Thomas in Chennai,
is a display of artifacts, primitive tools, grave markers, etc. claimed
to come from the settlement of St. Thomas himself. Does anyone know if
there has been any serious attempt to identify these artifacts and
determine their origin? are they fakes?

Thanks,
Robert Langston
