For the history of Christianity in India,
a) What are the inscription, copper plates and their dates
mentioning Christianity?
b) Where is the earliest Church? Its date?
c) Early artifacts decidedly of Christian religion.
c) Names of Sanskrit and Tamil texts mentioning Christianity?
d) Given that Christianity is so old in Kerala, why no Bible
either in Tamil, Malayalam, Sanskrit until British rule in
19th century?

Regards.
