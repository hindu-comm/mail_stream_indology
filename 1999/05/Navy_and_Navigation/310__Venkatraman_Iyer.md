 >> The art of Navigation was born in the river Sindh 6000 years ago.
 >> The very word Navigation is derived from the Sanskrit word
 >> NAVGATIH. The word navy is also derived from Sanskrit 'Nou'.

A friend forwarded this circulating in cyberspace; supposedly
this comes with a long list of ancient India's achievements.
What is the currently held opinion in Indology on the words,
Navy and Navigation?

Please compare the following Tamil words:
"nAvu" = 1) to thrust the tongue and move it sideways,
          2) to winnow and clear grains from stones.

>â€‰From the root verb, "nAvu", many Dravidian words are
formed; i) "nA/nAvu/nAkku" = tongue
ii) "nAvAy" = ship, vessel, possibly because the ship rips
apart the surface waters while in motion.
iii) "nAvikan2" = mariner

Navy and Navigation are ultimately related to
Ta. words like 'nAvu, nAvikan, nAvAy" etc.

Appreciations for telling more on
the Sanskrit words for Navy and Navigation.

Sincerely,
V. Iyer
