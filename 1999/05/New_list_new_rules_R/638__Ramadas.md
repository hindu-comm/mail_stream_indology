In reference to your statement ** a great many messages posted by a
relatively small number of people ** , please count up the number of members
who are engaging in these areas of discussion. I think you will find that **
relatively small number of people ** is a gross injustice to the large cross
section of contributors. In fact, I fancy I even saw at least one posting
from yourself. Are you also placing yourself in this category? ;-)

Kindest regards
