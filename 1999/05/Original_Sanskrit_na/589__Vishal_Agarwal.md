Not quite.  I have been to Sitapur, and to Naimisharanya, and they are not
the same, although they are not far from each other.  Naimisharanya is now
commonly known as `Nimsar', although the original name itself is also
still used in formal or literate usage.  One would guess that Sitapur has
its original Sanskrit name.  What reason exists to believe otherwise?
