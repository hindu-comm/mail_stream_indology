I don't suppose they say the same of Abdus Salaam, the
Nobel Prize winner in Physics and arguably the most
prominent son of Jhang in the 20th century ; - )

There do not seem to be any Pakistanis in Indology, so
let me defend Jhang as best as I can ; - ). Perhaps
you're aware of the Punjabi proverb

rAvi kIrAn di, chenAb fakIrAn di

(Loosely translated as "Ravi waters breed grasping
tendencies whereas Chenab waters breed world
renouncers").

Also, you may want to remember that the heroine Heer
of the ballad Heer Raanjha was from Jhang.

The reason for this bad press for Jhang is not very
clear to me unless it be from the Rigveda, Puranas or
other historical texts ; - )

Thanks and Warm Regards,

Lakshmi Srinivas
