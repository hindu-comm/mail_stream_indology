I am trying to get information regarding the group of Maharashtrians
who went to Tamil Nadu during the Peshwa era and who are often referred
to as TDB (Thanjavur Deshasta Brahmins). A large number of them settled
around Thanjavur and they founded the Sarasvati Mahal library there. I
have been told that the migration happened during the reign of Kings
Shivaji and Sambhaji. I would like to know if anything has been
published about them.

TIA,
Prasad
