Dear George Thompson,
Me too; I will also be interested in learning more about Avestan and Vedic; I
would like to understand the bases for controversies regarding a hypothetical
proto-Indo-Iranian and the relative chronology between Vedic and Avestan; in
case you find any relevant lists or references, please do let me know. I would
deeply appreciate it.
Thanks for your consideration and with the best regards,
Kalyanaraman
