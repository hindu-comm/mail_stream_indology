Vishal, could you give an example or two of these absurdities?

The book referred to here is 'Vedic Tantrism' by M.S. Bhat; Motilal
Banarsidass; 1987

1. VERSE 1.7: Here, the word Brahmana means the 'Brahmin caste' while Dr.
Gonda translates it otherwise, ignoring the fact that succeeding verses talk
of the other 3 castes (Pg. 282)

2. VERSE 1.22: Prof. Gonda has mistranslated the expression 'Avasanasya
Pati' as "The lord of Death". This violates the context. (Pg. 285)

3. VERSE 1.112: The word 'Vasamsi' is mistranslated by Dr. Gonda as
'residences'. The correct translation viz. clothes, is given by Dr. Bhat.
(Pg. 303)

I suggest you read the book yourself and compare the translation of Bhat and
Gonda with the original text. You will then discern what I meant.

Best regards,

Vishal
