Yes, I would like a reference or two. That Govinda Bhagavatpada lived a long
life is an old tradition, but the connection to the raseSvara school and the
legend that he had the body of a young boy don't seem to be so. Our
mythology has many figures who lived long lives, but without any reference
to raseSvara techniques. I haven't seen any such reference in the
mAdhavIya, anantAnandagirIya, cidvilAsIya or keralIya Sankaravijaya texts,
nor in the SankarAbhyudayas.

Agreed, but the notion that Govinda Bhagavatpada prolonged his life through
the use of drugs is a rather strange one for Advaita lore, and indeed a
completely new one to me personally.
