The dictionary is openable on a Macintosh but maybe only the PDF file and
then you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader to view it. It is freely
downloadable from:

Printing the dictionary may be an answer, I did a trial page and it came
out well.


>I visited your indology page and admired it. The openning page is gorgeous.
