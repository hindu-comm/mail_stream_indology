Students of Indology,

I am interested in learning more about the
ontological, epistemological, and metaphysical
foundations of santarasa within Abhinavagupta's works
on pratyabhijna and tantrika.

Where might I dig for these roots?

Any comments on chronology would be welcomed as well.
(I am aware of K. C. Pandey's and Ingalls' sense of
order.)

a thousand thank you-s in advance,

Tim Lighthiser
