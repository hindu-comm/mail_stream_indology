There is "kan2n2al" occuring in CT.
Like nerunal-nen2n2al pair, is kan2n2al coming from
karunal?

"karunal" seeems to be repeating the same meaning twice,
called as "mImicaic col" in tamil grammar.
Both 'karu' and 'nal' denoting black.
DED speculates ta. "al" (night) coming from "nal'.

Is early sugarcane black in color?

Your thoughts welcome,
N. Ganesan
