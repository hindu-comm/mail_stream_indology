Prof. Hebbar  had  given  the  correct  info  to  us  as
"dakShiNakalAryas"  and  "UttarakalAryas"  for  Tengalais  and
VaDagalais  respectively.  It  was  our  clerical  error  in  tying  it
in.  It  is  similar  to  your  "I  has  to  be  dakSiNakalA"  instead
of  "It  has  to  be  dakSiNakalA."  Thanks  for  rest  of  the  info.

Students  of  Prof.Hebbar
