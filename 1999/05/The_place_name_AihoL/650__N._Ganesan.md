Dear Shri. B. Hebbar and others,

Greetings.

Interested in the meaning of the Karnataka town, AihoLe.
Important Chalukya temple site and center of the merchant guilds
called maNigrAma.

Does hoLe mean garden/park etc., in Kannada?
What does the "ai" in aihoLe stand for?
Does "ai" mean five OR beauty?

Thanks for your guidance,
N. Ganesan
