It seems to me that the primary causes may have been : 1. Historical
hostility between Srilankan Buddhists and Tamil Hindus (Tamil Kings
are have invaded Lanka and caused havoc many a time). 2. Political
power struggle between higher caste Tamils and Sinhalese for which
the poor lower caste Tamils were dragged in for no fault of their
own (which is exactly what happened in Tamil Nadu in the guise of
the Dravidian movement).
(((

In addition, the outdated 'Aryan' supremacy idea of the 19th
century. This 'racist' idea empowers the Sri Lankan state
whose majority speak an "Aryan" language and outwardly profess
"peaceful" religion to perform 'ethnic cleansing'.
Many monks and politicians and academics have aroused the
Sinhala feelings that Dravidians are Non-Aryan and Non-Buddhist.

Misinterpretations of Aryan and Buddhism abound.
