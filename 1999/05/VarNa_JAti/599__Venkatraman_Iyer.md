In a public place of dining, there would be some problems
in Tamil Nadu to ask for two divided, separate seatings for
Brahmins and others; In 1920s, when V. V. S. Ayyar implemented
this in a school run by Congress, there were some protests.
Over the years, I have seen that the name boards with names like
BrahmaNaaL Cafe advertising separate seats for Brahmins have declined.

Probably the old system will return.

Regards.
