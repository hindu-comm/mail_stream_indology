paripATal says the river vaikai running by Madurai is
flooded when it rains on the caiyam mountain!
"
purai kezu caiyam pozi mazai tAza
neri tarUum vaiayip pun2al". (paripATAl:11:about 12-15?)

mEru = himAlayAs?
rA.rAghava aiyengkAr  concludes so in his commentary to
some kuRuntokai poem. He also cites texts in Tamil that state that ziva
employed himAlayas as the bow in his battle with the three purams.
