Dear Friends,

I need some reliable information regarding the following questions:

1. When and where was the prsthamatra-vocalization for
nagari-manuscripts in use and when was it last used for that script?
2. When and where was nandinagari used in manuscripts?

Any suggestions, also regarding books or articles related to these
topics, are appreciated.

Thanks for reading
