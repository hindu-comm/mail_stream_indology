A student who is writing a thesis in political science in international
relations would like to translate the terms jati and varna into English.
She would like to know the currently accepted academic translations for
these terms.

She would also like to know if there is any academic precedent for
referring to scheduled tribes as 'dalit'.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
