>â€‰From what I have seen on varNa, I think that the most correct
translation into English would be "heraldic color". It is not race or
skin color related, and there is a similar use of color Western
Indo-European languages. French-readers may consult Bernard Sergent on
the subject of symbolic colors, see p. 435f of Les Indo-Europeens.
