This is in response to Samar Abbas's message of Sat, 22 May 1999 09:13:39
+0530 regarding jaati and varNa.  The definitions he gives for these two
terms must be taken with a grain of salt.  While jaati in origin may refer
to a professional guild, it certainly does not necessarily any more.  More
important, to give a "racial" or "skin color" definition for varNa is
almost certainly incorrect.  The colors associated with the varNas in Vedic
Prose texts generally are:  white (i.e. pure) for the brahmin, red (the
color of blood shed in battle?) for the kSatriya, yellow (the color of ripe
grain or the color of gold ?) for the vaizya, and black (the opposite of
white, i.e. ritually impure, not permitted to participate in sacrifices
etc.) for the zuudra.  While white and black could possibly be considered
"racial" designations (at least by modern racialist or racist definitions),
yellow and especially red would hardly make sense as skin color
designations in India (or, for that matter, anywhere else in the case of
red).

No matter what political axes anyone may want to grind, I believe it is
time to transcend 19th-century European tendencies to see everything in
"racial" terms.
