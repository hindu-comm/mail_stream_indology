>(Actually apart from the Tamils none of the other "Dravidians" (Keralites,
>Andhrites, Kannadigas? Marathas?) seem keen on claiming a Dravidian

To some extent, this can be due to the poor state of wealth/economics
among today's Tamils; The success of varNa dharma, sanskrit alphabets
and words are some other reasons why Non-Tamil Dravidians
are little shy of their Dravidian heritage.

Greetings,
Prasad
