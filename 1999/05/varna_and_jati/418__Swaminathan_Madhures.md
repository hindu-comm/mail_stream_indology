  I do not know how much exposure you have to Keralan low classes;
   as your writings are mainly concerned with `high classes'.
   Kerala caste system, arranged vertically has more people of fair
   complexion among `high classes' whom you are in contact with
   and very many people who are quite dark among the `low classes'.

   Can it be the 'sambandham' phenomenon working?
