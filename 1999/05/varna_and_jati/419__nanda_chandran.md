This may well be due to the fact that the lower strata of the society are
usually engaged in manual labour, working in the fields etc and are
constantly exposed to the sun, thus resulting in a dark complexion.

This can be observed anywhere. Even in the USA I've seen quite a few white
labourers, who're not so white as those not engaged in such work.

>Can it be the 'sambandham' phenomenon working?

Yes. Working only in our minds.
