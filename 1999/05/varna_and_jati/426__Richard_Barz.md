To everyone on the Indology list,

I'm the political science student of Dr Richard Barz who was searching for
information on the terms varna and jati.I've been overwhelmed by the
response, and would like to express my gratitude to you all for your very
generous help.All the informatuon and suggested readings have been
wonderful.

Thanks again,

Rahni Ennor
