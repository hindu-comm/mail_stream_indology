I have to agree with Mr. Nanda Chandran on this. Why can't the non-brahmins
become more culturally aware and learn carnatic music, bharatanatyam etc?

I think all of us emotional Indians should pause for a moment and look among
our friends, classmates and neighbours and see if we would consider them
self-serving, culture destroying, etc. I certainly would not.

One final question, if the brahmins that came to Tamilnadu were such a
culture destroying bunch, then why is Tamil their mother tongue?
