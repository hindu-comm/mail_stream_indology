Wait a minute. Except for the composers, performance wise, Carnatic music
and Bharatanatyam were both largely non-Brahmin preserves till the Brahmins
took to the arts in large numbers within the last two centuries. Name one
Bharatanayam master who does not have a Pillai in the guru lineage, or who
is not a Pillai himself. Name one Brahmin who plays the Nadaswaram or the
Thavil, the temple instruments.
