Esteemed list members,

Is the dynasty title, viSNukuNDin related to kuNDu (pot/jar)?
If so, were the vELs? Any agastya links to them?
Were their deity Skanda?

Comapre: Chaulukyas in their inscriptions claim they are of vEL kulam;
Tamil nighaNTus like Pingalandai, cEntan divAkaram (8th cemtury)
say Chalukyas are vELir. Also, the place names bELuuru, beLagAm.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
