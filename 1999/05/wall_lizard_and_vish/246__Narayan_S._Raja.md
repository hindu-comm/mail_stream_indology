Well... Vishnu is known as
"thiruvarangaththil palli kolbavan".    :-)  :-)

Sorry for the ridiculous joke.
Credit goes to Dr. J. Chandrasekhar
of I.I.Sc, Bangalore.

Regards,


Raja.

PS:  Translation of joke for non-Tamil speakers:

     "thiruvarangaththil palli kolbavan" ==
     he who kills lizards in Srirangam

     "thiruvarangaththil paLLik koLbavan" ==
     he who reclines in Srirangam == Vishnu
