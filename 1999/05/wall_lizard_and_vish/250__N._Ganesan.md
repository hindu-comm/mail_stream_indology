--------------------------------------------------
I do not know the legends but I do know that a sacred lizard is
associated with (at least) one of the temples of Kanchipuram. I know
this because one of the little momentos on one of my bookshelves is a
flat cheap metal 3x5 inch framed picture of two lizards with a sun and
moon that's labeled "SACRED LIZARD Kancheepuram" with a two line
inscription in Telugu.

I wouldn't be surprised if Vasudha Narayanan or David Shulman knows
more than I do.
