We have imposed a posting limit of 3 messages per day per person on the
INDOLOGY list.  This is considered to be a very high upper limit, just to
slice off the very worst abuses.  It recognises that sometimes when a
specialist topic comes up, the rapid exchange of several messages over a
couple of days can be appropriate.

If you post an average of more than one message every two days (15 per
month) you are likely to receive an "over-posting" warning at the end of a
month. Three warnings -> membership cancellation.

Best wishes,
