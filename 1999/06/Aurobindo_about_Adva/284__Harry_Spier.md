See: The Foundations of Indian Culture ISBN (Bd.) 81-7058-304-7, ISBN (Pb.)
81-7058-01-7 Seventh Impression: 1992, published by Sri Aurobindo Ashram
page 71.  The publishers note says that this is from an article published in
the monthly review "Arya" sometime between December 1918 and January 1921.

I quote:
"...It is only recently that educated India accepted the ideas of English
and German scholars, imagined for a time Shankara's Mayavada to be the one
highest thing, if not the whole of our philosophy, and put it in a place of
exclusive prominence. ..."

Yours,


Harry Spier
