Seeing that some of the list members have been reading Aurobindo,
someone may help me with a reference. I was told that has written
somewhere that the prominence that is given to Advaitavedanta is not
the result of a natural development in Indian philosophy, but due to
the interest given in that school of thought by Western authors. Has
anyone on the list come across such a statement, and if so: where
does it occur?
