Dear Madhav,
I am taking a printout of your mail to India to see if I can find further
information on the subject. In the meantime, you may chack
Sanskrit Commission (1956) Report for some details on this point. I
faintly remember that the Deccan College and the Shravan Maas
Dakshinaa Pariikshaa at Badoda are offshoots of the Poona
Dakshinaa tradition.
Best wishes.
KSA
