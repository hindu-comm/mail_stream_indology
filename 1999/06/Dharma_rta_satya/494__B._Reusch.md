It would appear that those scholars who read Rta in the Rg veda as "cosmic
order" would tend to see equivalences between vedic Rta and epic dharma. On
the other hand, those scholars who read rta in the RV as "truth"see
themselves as the opposing camp -- truth vs cosmic order.
Would satya in the MBh, for the Rta = truth advocates, be some kind of an
epic equivalent of vedic Rta?
