Observation
The difference between rta and satya on the one hand and dharma
on the other can be best illustrated by that between 'constitution'
and 'rules and regulations' of an organisation. Keeping the
constitution intact, rules are changed from time to time. Ancient
authors including those of the Mahabharata are aware of this
difference as can be judged from the following quotes:
(1)  zrutir vibhinnA smRtayash ca bhinnA
        naiko munir yasya vacaH pramANam /
        dharmasya tattvaM nihitaM guhAyAM
        mahAjano yena gataH sa panthAH // (Mahabharata)
(2)  anye kRtayuge dharmAs tretAyAM dvApare 'pare /
        anye kaliyuge nRNAM yugahrAsAnurUpataH //
                                                                        (ManusmRti)
To use modern terminology, rta /satya is nature while dharma is
culture which is man-made. It is an erroneous identification of the
two that has led human groups to devastating conflicts as history
(including the current one) amply testifies.
