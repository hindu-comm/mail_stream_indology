Thanks to Paolo Magnone, BTW,  for the rich number of citations from his
forthcoming article:
especially to the

>.... well known BhaviSya PuraaNa
>passage referring to the Nyuuha (i. e., Noah) myth!

Is it also the case that that purana of the future _foretells_ the reign of
queen Victoria? Chapter and verse citations would be appreciated for both
passages.
