I may have been out of line. However, I have seen attempts on the Internet to prove
that Indo-European languages descend from Tamil, which of course also means that
Sanskrit must descend from Tamil, and ideas about Tamil as a kind adi-language have
been launched in the context of the Dravidian movement. But you are right, I should
not generalize, since evidently not everyone in the South shares these ideas. My
apologies.
