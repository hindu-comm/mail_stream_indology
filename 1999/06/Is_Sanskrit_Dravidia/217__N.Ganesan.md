It is good that you pointed this out. What I said here is wrong.
I meant that one third *of foreign words* in Hindi cannot be
attributed to Dravidian or Munda, but rather to this language x.
I did not mean one third of all Hindi words.

These borrowed terms tend to be agricultural terms, by the way.

Dear George,

Is there a word list of the agricultural terms
that Masica talks about?

Thanks,
N. Ganesan
