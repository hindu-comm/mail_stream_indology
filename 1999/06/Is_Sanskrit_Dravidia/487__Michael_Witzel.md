Somebone who denies that

* Skt & IE  as inflected languages (with stem variation, suffixes and
prefixes and with a  apophony <Ablaut> in roots, stems  and affixes)
* and Dravidian  (with agglutinative structure)
are different in their most basic set-up <not to speak of their roots>,
and who denies this in spite of having been shown that by Indology members
(such as HH Hock)

has a fixed mind set.

I rest my case: Rgveda10.10.13a.  ---   ity alam.
