Yes. Frawley is not a reliable source, and his etymology of Zarathushtra is nonsense. The last part of the word is ushtra, which means camel. Unfortunately, I haven't got access to my "Iranian" books, and I don't remember what the first part of the word means, except that it is probably a verb. 

Let someone else come to the rescue here.
