On 30 oct 98, Prof. Y. Vassilkov wrote on zaratuStra here.

zara-tuStra - "one whose camels are old" parallel to
the Mitanni Aryan name, vRddhAzva "one whose horses are old".
He adds:
"all these names aiming at turning off, repelling
evil spirits by way of showing them the insignificance and
poverty of the man bearing the name (old horses/or camels,
bad chariot, no money, nothing interesting at all here, go
away!)."
