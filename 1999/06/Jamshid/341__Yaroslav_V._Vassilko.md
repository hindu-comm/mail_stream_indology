Dear Mr.Ganesan,
        there was probably a mistake in my old posting which you quote:
the prophet's name is to be split into *zarat-uStra* (not *zara-tuStra*).
        Best regards,
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov

>zara-tuStra - "one whose camels are old" parallel to
>the Mitanni Aryan name, vRddhAzva "one whose horses are old".
>He adds:
>"all these names aiming at turning off, repelling
>evil spirits by way of showing them the insignificance and
>poverty of the man bearing the name (old horses/or camels,
>bad chariot, no money, nothing interesting at all here, go
>away!)."
