This is a beautiful folk etymology, but nothing more than that.  Avestan
_zara*t-ushtra_ (where _*t_ indicates the symbol usually transliterated as
a _t_ with a tiled underneath) would correspond to Skt. _jarad-uSTra_, and
is usually taken as a bahuvrihi meaning 'having aged/aging camels'.

>> Thanks  for  your  input.  "Asura  MAyA"  is  indeed  an  interesting
>> rendering  for  "Ahura  Mazda".  But  I  thought  "Zarathusthra"  meant
>> "camel-tormenter".  "uShTra"  meaning  "camel"  in  Sanskrit  also.  Any
>> clarification  is  appreciated.

>I found something on the name Zarathustra.  David Frawley in his
>book "Gods, Sages and Kings" writes (on page 223):
>
>"The name of Zoroaster, the founder of the ancient Persian religion,
>is traceable to Sanskrit Hari-dyut-astra, the beautiful light of the
>star."

>Any comments on this?
