I refer to my former answer to Chandra's question and can now suggest a
simple way of checking Greek and Latin words: Use the Perseus web site:

http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/

Here you will get access to Greek and Latin texts, and also to electronic
dictionaries for both languages. Here you will also find a fairly large
number of words that end in -trum og -tron. However, several of the Latin
words in -trum are Greek loanwords.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
