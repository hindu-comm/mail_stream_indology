Dear Mr. Madhuresan,

Could you list some (5 would be sufficient) contradictions in Dr. Frawley's
works for my benefit?

Thank you in advance,

Vishal

Dear Toke,

Don't take David Frawley seriously. Most of his writings
is garbage and with several contradictions, though he has
good support from the Hindutva folks. This will become clear
as you spend years studying old India.

Best wishes,
SM
