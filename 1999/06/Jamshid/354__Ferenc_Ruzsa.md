>Could you give some examples of such  Latin/Greek please?

Greek: a suffix forming 'nomina instrumenti' (nouns naming the instrument of
the action) from verbs, tro-n, also thro-n, where the -n is the ending of
sg. Nom-Acc. neut.

skEptron (staff, sceptre) from skEptO (to prop)
arotron (plough) from aroO (to till)
theAtron (theatre, audience) from theAomai (to view)
threptron (usu. pl.: reward for bringing up) from trephO (to feed, nourish,
bring up)
kentron (sting, goad) from kenteO (to pierce, incite)
plEktron (plectrum) from plEssO (root plEg-: to strike, beat, hit)

Latin: tru-m, where the -n is the ending of sg. Nom-Acc. neut. Most of them
loanwords from the Greek, but some are not:


arAtrum (plough) from arO, arAre (to plough)
rutrum (spade) from ruO, ruere (dig)
veretrum (pudendum) from vereor, verEri (to be shy)
spectrum (vision) from speciO, specere (to look, see)


Regards,
Ferenc
