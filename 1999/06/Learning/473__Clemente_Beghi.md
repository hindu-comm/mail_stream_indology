Hello everyone.
I am a neophyte in the study of ancient India.
I'd like to have information(bibliography,web pages etc)on the vaishnava
and shaiva tradition and history.
I would also like to know if there are Sanskrit and Vedic discussion
groups and learning resources(expecially mailing lists).
Thank you very much,Clemente Beghi
