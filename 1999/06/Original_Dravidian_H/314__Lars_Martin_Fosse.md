I am venturing into territory here where I don't strictly belong, but from what I believe I have heard, there are two versions of the out-of-Africa theory: One assumes that we are all descended from an early homo sapiens. The second assumes that some humans developed from an earlier form of homo (erectus or something), so that we don't all have homo sapiens as ancestor. But I immediately profess a complete lack of professionality in these matters and ask for clarification. 

As for India, it goes without saying that no matter whether who we descend from everybody comes from Africa in the final analysis. The Dravidians, by the way, were not the first to arrive in India. There were other populations in India before the Dravidians. These have more or less been absorbed by the present populations.  This is about as far as my knowledge goes, so others: please step in.
