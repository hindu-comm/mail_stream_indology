The term "pre-Dravidian speakers" though could describe people who
came thousands or many tens of thousands of years ago to South Asia.
The time period would be important in making judgements about the
"origin" of Dravidian languages and people.

Again, the question could fall into relative dating. Folk like Talageri
(Hindutva?) don't seem to argue against the idea of people migrating
from Africa.  Their theory is concentrated more on the fact that Indian
languages have evolved in India for a very long time. They argue against
the idea of a sudden intrusion of languages into North India from the
West around 2000-1500 BCE.
