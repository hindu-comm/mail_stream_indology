I think it was Henry Heras who first suggeted that the
fish signs in IVC seals represent 'star' as in Tamil.



--------------------------------------------------------

Does Hungarian meny (a kind of fish) and menny (heaven)
come from a verb something to do with brightness or shining?

Ta. mIn (star and fish) comes from the verb "min" (to shine,
to be bright etc.,). Compare Ta. 'minnal' = lightning.
