 >4.  Both  the  Aryans  and  Dravidians  entered  India  from  the
 >outside.  (again,  know  not  who  advocates  this?)

  But then, there is lot of difference between Dravidians
in Indus valley by 5000 B.C. and Aryans there around 1200 B.C.
In Historical studies, even a few centuries makes a lot of
difference. Just today,  Dr. Fosse missed/mixed the Alexander's
date of 3rd cent. B.C. with 3rd cent. A.D., Of course, someone
pointed this out.
