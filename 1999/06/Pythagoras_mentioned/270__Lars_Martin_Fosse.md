Pythagoras is definitely not mentioned in the Vedas, not do I think that
he turns up in the Puranas. What you are referring to is a modern cultural
myth to the effect that P. (and the Greeks) got their mathematics from
India. This is a kind of counter-myth to the traditional European view
that the Indians got their mathematics from the Greeks. It would in fact
seem that Indians and Greeks got at least some of their mathematics from
Babylon, but there are no certain conclusions here.

Best regards,
