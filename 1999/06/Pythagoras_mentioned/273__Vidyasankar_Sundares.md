The oldest European reference to a connection between Pythagoreanism and
India is possibly the "Life of Apollonius" written by Philostratus
Flavius(ca. 3rd cent CE). Apollonius of Tyana, the Neo-Pythagorean, who was
considered an incarnation of Pythagoras, is said to have visited India.

For a modern Indian myth based upon this, see T. M. P. Mahadevan's remarks
in his introduction to "Gaudapada: A Study in Early Vedanta" published by
the Madras University (4th ed., 1975).
