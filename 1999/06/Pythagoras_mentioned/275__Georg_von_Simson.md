Dear Lars Martin,
   there is after all a slight difference between the 3rd century B.C. and
the 3rd century A.D.!
   All the best,
      Georg

>> The oldest European reference to a connection between Pythagoreanism and

>> Flavius(ca. 3rd cent CE). Apollonius of Tyana, the Neo-Pythagorean, who was

>> For a modern Indian myth based upon this, see T. M. P. Mahadevan's remarks
