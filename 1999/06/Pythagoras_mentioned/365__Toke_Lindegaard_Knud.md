Thank you for the help.  I know of Seidenberg's work.  His ideas are
very interesting and he has many good points.  Are you aware of
any references to reactions to his ideas from more conservative
scholars?  Jens Hoyrup (an authority on Babylonian mathematics)
told me to be very careful with Seidenberg.

Regarding "Agni" then I ordered it via the Royal Library here in
Copenhagen, but for some reasons they never got back to me.  I
will try and contact them again.  I get the impression that "Agni" is
a very important work.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
