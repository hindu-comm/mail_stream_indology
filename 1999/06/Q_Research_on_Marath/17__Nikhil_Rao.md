In  the group of Thanjavur Maharashtrians, there are also marathas in
addition to the brahmins. This migration started during Shahaji's time
initially may be to the mysore bangalore area and then shifted to Thanjavur
when Venkoji took over Thanjavur from the Nayak rulers. Why there was
migration of deshastha brahmins only and not chitapavanas or karhades has
been a puzzle to me perhaps during the early years of Shahaji/Venkoji's rule
the chitapavanas may not have yet migrated to the deccan area from konkan.
Atleast one of the Mathas established by Samarth Ramdas is still in
existence in Thanjavur.
