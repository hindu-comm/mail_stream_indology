>To draw a hard line between professional and non-professional scholars is
>(especially in the case of Indology!!!) very problematic.
>For many reasons, coexistence is structural.
>There are so many possible points of view for philology, etc.....

>I have often felt the problem was not a problem of the quality
>of postings but of the QUANTITY.

Delete button's use is advocated. Instituting a quota
system on quality postings will only hinder the growth
