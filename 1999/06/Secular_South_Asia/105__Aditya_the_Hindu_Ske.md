(a) When people are not interested in a subject then it falls off the
mailing list and no special effort is needed from one subscriber. It is
a poor and lame excuse for some one who  wants to say the last word but
does not want others to respond.
(b)
I consider you last sentence an unnecessary ad hominem attack by calling
some one who has different opinion from you as ignorant however
misinformed that person may be in your opinion. The fair solution would
have been to provide the correct information and not resort to name
calling.


Have a peaceful and joyous day.
