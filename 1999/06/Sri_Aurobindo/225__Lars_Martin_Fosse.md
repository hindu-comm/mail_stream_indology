Dear members of the net,

do any of you happen to know when Shri Aurobindo first published his
"The Secret of the Veda". This book has been published by Sri Aurobindo
Ashram, Pondicherry, in 1971, but since Aurobindo died in 1950, I assume
that the Secret of the Veda was first published before that.

Thanks in advance!

Lars Martin Fosse
