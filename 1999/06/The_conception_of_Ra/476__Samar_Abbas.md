The following article in `Modern Rationalist' states that after the
ashwamedha Dasaratha handed over his queens to the disciples of guru
Kalaikottu Muni. The author then concludes that one of the disciples of
Kalaikottu Muni was the real father of Rama & not Dasaratha. (this is not
my work)

 Is this story universally accepted ? What do Hindutvadins have to say
about the allegations of Ram's illegitimacy ?
