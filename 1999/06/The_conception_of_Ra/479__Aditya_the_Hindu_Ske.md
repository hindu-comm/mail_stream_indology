On what basis do you assert that the system of Niyoga was Vedic? In
which Veda is it prescribed? Please provide some reference.

Of course, Ramayan is an epic with mythical characters created by its
author who in tradition of day even had himself participate in its story
as real life character. Who are you to say what he had in mind other
than what you can read in his writing?
