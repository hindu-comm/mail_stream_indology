There is a Puranic myth in which an Asura with a human body and horse head
steals the Vedas when Brahma is asleep between two kalpas. Vishnu has to
take a similar form as the Asura in order to kill him and retrieve the
Vedas. I forget the exact Puranic source, but it should not be difficult to
track down.

In the Brahmanda Purana, it is Vishnu-Hayagriva who reveals the worship of
Sakti to Agastya and others.
