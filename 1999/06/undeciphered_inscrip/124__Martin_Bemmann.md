Dear List,

on behalf of my colleague Dr. Nasim Khan from Peshawar University I
would like to draw your attention to an undeciphered inscription on
shist stone from Gandhara in the collection of the Department of
Archaeology, Univ. Peshawar. I placed an image on our homepage and I
would ask everybody interested to take a look at it
(http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/institute/sonst/adw/kara/sign.html).
Suggestions please send offlist to knasim at hotmail.com and/or to the
undersigned.

Regards,
