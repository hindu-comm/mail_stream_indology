Dr Palaniappan,

In your posts on this thread, I was having trouble
with the methodology you were using.

 If I were to use your classification of the steps
involved, I'd have called step (1) Etymology of Group
Name consisting of at least 3 aspects viz., literal
meaning attested in texts for the sense of the word
under discussion, influence of geographical
connotation, social connotation, and any others. Your
posts, IMHO, dealt only with one aspect of step (1).

I'll take you up on your offer, after a while,  to
continue the discussion offline.

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
