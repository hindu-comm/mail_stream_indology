This has to do with the complexity of the term brahma. To most of us,
brahman refers to the ultimate reality or supreme principle. Within the
Vedic/upanishadic corpus, the variety of meanings of the term brahman can be
deduced from the context.

Specifically in the cchAndogya text, brahma-vidyaa in Narada's list is
juxtaposed with kshatra-vidyaa. The compound brahma-kshatra is a term that
occurs frequently. If I remember right, Narada asks for some knowledge that
would remove his sorrow. Sanatkumara proceeds to teach him in stages,
ultimately leading to the highest brahman. In the upanishadic/Vedantic
traditions, it is axiomatic that he who knows the highest reality knows no
sorrow and no fear. Obviously, the brahma-vidyaa listed by Narada as
something that he already knows is not the knowledge of the highest brahman.

Vidyasankar
