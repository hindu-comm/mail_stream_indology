The Skanda who makes children ill is described in the uttaratantra of the
Susrutasamhita, and also in the Revatikhanda of the Kasyapasamhita.  The
latter text is translated and discussed in my book _The Roots of Ayurveda_
(Delhi: Penguin, 1998).  I have also discussed the subject of Skanda and
demonic attack in the medical context in two articles recently.

Dominik Wujastyk, "Demons of disease", in _Holistic Health and Medicine_
(Calicut: Univ. of Calicut and Arya Vaidya Sala, 1998). [These details may
not be perfect; I'm doing it from memory.]

and Roy Porter (London, New York: Kegan Paul International, 1999).

All the best,
Dominik
