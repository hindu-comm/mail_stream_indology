As Indology participants cannot be expected  to know all Indian
languages, I think it would be good form if discutants always provided
quotations from original texts with translations. Tedious - maybe. But
certainly more educational.

It's quite possible that the lines contain important information. How an
ignoramus like myself (I don't believe I am going to learn Tamil) would know
it?
