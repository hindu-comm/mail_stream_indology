Dear Indologists,

I am looking for bibliographical references, images, or even
a piece of advice, about these different subjects :

- The iconography of the Mahabharata.

- The representations of the signs of the zodiac, peculiarly
  in the art of Gandhara.

- The iconography of the Moon-god in the art of Gandhara.

Thanks in advance,

                         Magali Vacherot.
