It would be practical to have some Kannada, of course, but it would be
equally, if not more appropriate to brush up your spoken Sanskrit.  I
visited Melkote briefly a couple of years ago, and there are many brahmins
and scholars there, both in the Academy and based at the temple (where
there is another manuscript collection), and Sanskrit is a very practical
and appropriate means of communication in that milieu.

Best,
Dominik
