Friends,

I am going to spend three months in Melkote (near Mysore), and I thought it
would be nice to have some preliminary knowledge of the local dialect. So
could someone, please, recommend a basic grammar or text-book of Kannada? If
it is in print, so much the better. (We have nothing of the kind in Hungarian
libraries).

Thank you
Ferenc
