The mantra pushhpam is not a sUktam and just a collation of various
texts. All the mantras under the mantra pushhpam in the Ramakrishna
Mutt edition are from the section of the tatittirIya AraNyaka known as
sUryanamaskAraH prashnaH. They are certainly from the vedas.

This is included in a recent publication of the Ramakrishna Mutt
called mantrapushhpam. It includes this text called mantrapushhpam
along with all the standard upanishhads, sUktams and so on.

I have no idea what the shivasa.nkalpa sUktam is. If you find let me
know. Thanks.
