 I am quoting from memory, as I do not have reference books at
 hand. I am going home in August; I will then search
 for its source.

 Translation:
 The (view of) the (divine) Veda is different/divergent;
 different/divergent again are (the views of) the (man-made)
 law codes. There is no single sage/seer whose word/verdict
 is authoritative/acceptable (to all). The essence/principle of
 sacred duty is (thus) concealed in a cave (darkness)/
 is inaccessible. The (right) way (of conduct) (which is left
 for us) is that which is followed by the great men.

 Best wishes.
 KSA
