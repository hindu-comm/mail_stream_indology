I thank everybody replying for their helpful suggestions.
The idea was, basically, not to survive in Melkote, but to use my time well
there. To learn some spoken Sanskrit is the main motive for my going there;
but of course I am trying hard already to convert some of my unidirectional
single medium capabilities (i. e. I can only read) into something more
versatile.
Thank you again
Ferenc
