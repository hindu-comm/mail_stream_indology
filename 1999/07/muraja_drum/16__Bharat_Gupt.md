Prof. Arul comment are very illuminating, but not being a linguist I am not in a
position to say if mauraja gave rise to murucam or viceversa. However, one thing is
certain that the Natyasastra is the oldest musicological text available , even older
than the Valmikiya Ramayana as it is evident from the the oldest portions like the
Sunder and Yuddha Kandas that Valmiki was using Bharat Muni's terminology with a
musicological awareness. I have discussed it in detail in my publications. I am not in
a position to pronouce that Silapaddikaram is older than Valimiki, but the common
belief is that it is not. The NS has been considered a later texts by Keith and
scholars of that period purely for non-natya reasons, they presumed that drama had
a Greek origin and that no theoretical text of theatre could have preceded the
extant ancient Indian plays.

For a scholar who is familiar both with Sanskrit and Tamil music texts, please
contact Mr. R Ramanathan of MAdras Univ, Music Dept.
