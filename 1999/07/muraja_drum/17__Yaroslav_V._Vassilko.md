 I would advice you to get in touch with Prof. Alexander Dubiansky (Moscow)
who is 1. a specialist in Tamil Classical literature, 2. a sanskritist, 3.
a musicologist and 4. a musician himself. His Moscow University E-mail
address is
        dubian at iaas.msu.ru
All the best,
                                Yaroslav Vassilkov
