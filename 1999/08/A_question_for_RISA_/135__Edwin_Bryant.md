The effeminate Hindu question, again

Dear scholars,

The question of Hindus being effeminate came up in the course of the
British colonial discourse and had a great influence on the development of
Hindu attitudes.


I would very much like to know whether anything of this sort came up
during the Muslim period. Did the conquering Muslims ever overtly accuse
Hindus of being effeminate? If so, where can I find references.

Thank you for your help.
