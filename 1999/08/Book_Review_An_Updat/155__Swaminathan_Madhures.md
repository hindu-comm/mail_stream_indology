  For a scholarly treatment of Caldwell's missionary motives and work,
 pl. see Ravindran Vaitheesparan's PhD thesis, U. Toronto (1998).
Ravi is a lecturer in History there and has published some papers in
South Indian Studies, U. Madras, Editor: M. S. S. Pandian.

Here is one, not a very scholarly assessment on Caldwell:
"the view that the South Indian languages have an origin different
from that of the North Indian languages is based on irresponsible,
ignorant and motivated utterances of a missionary".
N. R. Waradpande, "Facts and fiction about the Aryans"
in S. B. Deo & S. Kamath, The Aryan problem, Pune, 1993, p. 14-15.

Wardpande's view on IE family from the same:
"the linguists have not been able to establish that the similarities
in the Aryan or Indo-European languages are genetic, i.e., due to
their having a common ancestry".

In his recent review, Rajaram refers to this book (Deo/Kamath).
