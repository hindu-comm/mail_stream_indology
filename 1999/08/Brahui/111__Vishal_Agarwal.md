Dear Indologists,

What is the earliest attested presence of Brahui as a spoken language in
Baluchistan? How does the status of Brahui as a 'Dravidian' language fit
into the theory that IVC was essentially Dravidian?

It is well known that in Pre-Islamic India, several Kannada dynasties
occuppied lands up North (Gujarat, Maharashtra. Kannada inscriptions are
even said to be found in Rajasthan). Is it possible that the Brahuis are in
fact descendents of the Kannada elite that followed these ruling dynasties
and then happened migrate to Baluchistan? Are there any Baluchi traditions
which hint at these migrations?

>â€‰From the photographs that I have seen, the Brahui speakers have very 'Aryan'
features and are indistinguishible from their neighbours. Then, how does one
account for the fact that the Dravidians in that region were absorbed by
invading/migrating Aryans but managed to retain the Dravidian basis of their
language?

Thanks

Vishal
