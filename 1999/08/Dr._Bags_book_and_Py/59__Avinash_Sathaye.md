The details of  Dr. Bag's book are:
Mathematics in Ancient and Medieval India
Dr. A. K. Bag

Chaukhamba Orientalia Varanasi/Delhi
First edition 1979

I would also recommend another classic (if you can get hold of it)
History of Hindu Mathematics parts I,II (Motilal Banarsidas 1935, 38)
Reprinted by Asia Publishing House Bombay (Sorry, no further details. I only
have a copy of the original).
