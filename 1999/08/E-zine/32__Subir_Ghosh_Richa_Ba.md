Calling all ye Indologists and those interested in Indology




The Reviewer is a just relaunched FREE weekly e-zine of book reviews. The Reviewer, however, has a commitment not promises to keep. It is against junk non-fiction (read, infotainment) and pulp fiction that is unabashedly promoted by a host many periodicals the world over. For The Reviewer, there is room for everything except trash. Yet, it will not cater to the experts-only categories. Downright text books too are not meant for The Reviewer.
