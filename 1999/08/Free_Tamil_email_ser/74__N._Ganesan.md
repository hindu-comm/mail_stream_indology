>â€‰From 1996, a list exchanging information in Tamil language
is in operation (http://www.tamil.net) using Murasu anjal software.

Heard that a free email service in Tamil
using murasu anjal has been launched on 15 August 1999.
A user knowing Tamil alone can exchange email using this.
Something similar to Hotmail German and Japanese emails.

Has any Indologist tried the new facility at http://mail.ambalam.com?

Regards,
N. Ganesan
