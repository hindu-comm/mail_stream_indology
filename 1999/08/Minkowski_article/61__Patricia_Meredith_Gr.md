Dear Indologists,

In a 1989 JAOS article, C.Z. Minkowski
cites the following as a forthcoming article by himself and
I. Weeks: "The Frame Story and Ancient Indian Epic: P. A.
Grintser's Drevneindijskaya Proza."  I can't find it
anywhere.  Does anyone know if this has been published --
or anything else not in Russian about Grintser's work on
the MBh?  Thanks!

Patricia Greer
