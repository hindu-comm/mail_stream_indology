Dear Scholars,

Would like to know the details on
a book by Chowdhury so that I can place an order.
The book title is something like
"The Indian origin of the Chinese Nation".

Is he also part of the school that propagates its ideology that
IE originated in India and spread westward also?

Regards,
V. Iyer
