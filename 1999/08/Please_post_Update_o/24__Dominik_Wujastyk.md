Subject: Please post : Update of upaniShads page

        The upaniShad page of the Sanskrit document site has been
updated to include more upaniShads. In addition to the principal
upaniShads, other upaniShads
like the atharvashira and kaula have been added to the web site. The
newly added upaniShads are marked with a 'nava' superscript in
devanaagarii.
Interested readers are welcome to utilize the same at :
http://sanskrit.gde.to/doc_upanishhat/doc_upanishhat.html
and its mirror sites.
Contributions in the form of additional encodings and proof-reads are
welcome.
Thank you.

Please send suggestions and enquiries to either sanskrit at cheerful.com
or reply to sanskrit_documents at yahoo.com
