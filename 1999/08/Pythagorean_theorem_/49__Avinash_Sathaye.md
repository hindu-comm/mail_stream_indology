In his book "Mathematics in ancient India (Chaukhamba O.R.S. 16)" Dr. A.K. Bag
mentions Bhadrabahu to be one of the  Jains  "who quoted mathematical formulas
in connection with their doctrines, but were not Mathematicians
themselves"(p.8). Dr. Bag's book, of course, discusses various conjectures and
facts about the origin of the Pythagorian Theorem in great detail. He supports
the view that it was indeed fairly understood as a theorem - rather than an
experimental fact, in the Baudhayana shulba suktas and gives evidence based on
other geometric constructions from the suktas which show an understanding of the
theorem.
