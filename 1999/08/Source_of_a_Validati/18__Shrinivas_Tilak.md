    Does anyone know the source of the following validating principle in
Sanskrit grammar "...yathottara munInAm prAmANyam?" Apparently, it was used
by early commentators (vArttikakAra) to "overrule" (or to validate departure
from) PANini. Later commentators (bhASyakAra), in turn, used it for similar
purposes. I wonder if other schools, too, employed this effective
hermeneutic strategy to legitimate chnage or alternative interpretations.
