>â€‰From the complete records the English translation in 1 seems to be
from the same text as the Hindi trans. in 3.  No. 4 is in Telugu.

The LOC also has an uncataloged  manuscript Dhanurveda which I have
not been had the time to compare with these printed eds.  As far as I
know there is no study on whether the various printed and manuscript
Dhanurvedas are one work or several independent ones.
