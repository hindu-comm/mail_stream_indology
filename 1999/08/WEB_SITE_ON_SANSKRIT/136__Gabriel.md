Dear friends,
                        A group of people from Argentina has published a
Sanskrit Web Site. It is both in English and Spanish. Our mission or purpose
is to spread the Sanskrit culture all over the world.

It is based on frames but it has support for older non-frame capable
browsers. You are invited.
