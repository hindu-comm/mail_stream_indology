I read that the leopard is native to Africa and South Asia. The word is
from
Greek leo + pard. I wonder if 'pard' is related to Parth/Parthia,
Pers/Persia,
etc. The word for leopard in Turkic is pars. What is it in Indic, Hindi,
Iranian etc? If Indic-Iranian is an intrusion to this area then the word
must have existed in the previous inhabitants' language. Is the word
also
in Dravidian?
