        Dear Mr. Iyer,

                I don't know if this is of significance to you.
                But there is a Malayadhvaja who is a Pandya
        king fighting on the side of the Pandavas in the
        Maha Bharatha War. He is one of the fathers-in-law of
        Arjuna.
                Again there is another  Malayadhvaja who is
        a Pandya. He is the father of Devi Miinaakshi or
        Thadaathagai as she was known earlier.

        Regards

        Jayabarathi
