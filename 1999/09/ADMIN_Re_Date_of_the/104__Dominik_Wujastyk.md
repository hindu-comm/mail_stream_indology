Dear Madhuresan (and everyone),

When responding to an INDOLOGY posting, please do not quote the previous
posting at length, especially if your contribution is just a line or two.
Edit the original posting down to the particular sentence you wish to
respond to. If you want to respond to it all, as seems the case in your
current posting, then don't cite the original at all.  Everyone can see
the original if they want.

This will help with our continuing bandwidth problem.

With thanks,

Dominik Wujastyk
Founder, INDOLOGY list.
