Concerning AryabhaTa's theory of the earth's rotation, and its posterity in
India, you can also look at

>For a serious study of Indian astronomy you should looks at the writings of
>David Pingree.  A good place to start would be:
>
>"History of mathematical Astronomy in India," in Dictionary of Scientific
>Biography, vols. 15-16:533-633.  Ed. by C.C. Gillispie.  New York: Charles
>Scribner's Sons, 1981.  This is a reference work that should be easily
>available.
>
>For Aryabhata in particular, I would recommend the book: Aryabhatiya of
>Aryabhata, critical edition with translation.  K.S. Shukla and K.V. Sarma.
>New Delhi: Indian National Science Academy, 1976.
