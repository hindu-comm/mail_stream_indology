So far, so good.  No problem.

Could he just have been stating a simple fact,
i.e., that ceGkuTTuvan2 was mATalan2's king,
rather than "articulating a  case of linguistic
nationalism"?


Recently, my 4-1/2 year-old daughter told
me that her languages are English and Tamil,
and her country is Hawaii.  Is she articulating
a case of Hawaiian nationalism, or merely
stating (what she sees as) a fact?
