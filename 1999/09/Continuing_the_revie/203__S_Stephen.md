>>And how is it that you're now using kannaki instead of kannahi,
which you so obviously preferred before?

Nanda:

Kannaki is written as Kannaki, but pronounced as Kannahi, along the lines of
taaham (thirst), Aham, Mahan (son), Maeham (cloud) etc. Please refer to Mr.
N. Ganesan's posting of 4th March 98 (Item no. 011461) in the Indology
archives for the rules behind Tamil pronounciation.
