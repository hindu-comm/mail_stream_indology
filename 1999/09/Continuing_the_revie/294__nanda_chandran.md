Thanks for the clarification. But is the use 'ha' or 'gha'?

I'm not really familiar with the words that P Chandrasekaran,
has used. So I'll use the words provided by S Stephen, which
are in common usage in current Tamizh.

>taaham (thirst), Aham, Mahan (son), Maeham (cloud)

tA(gha)m, Ma(gha)n, Me(gha)m.

Ofcourse, brAhmanic use differs - using (ha) instead of (gha). But
if I remember right, usage by non-brAhmins seems more inclined
to "gha" instead of "ha".

And how about 'sha'? Even your names - Ganesan, Chandrasekaran
do not use the 'sha' as it's used in brAhmanic circles - Gane(sha)n,
Chandra(sh)ekaran.
