Dear list members,

Apologies.

In my post "Sanskrit words ending in cerebral N, where I wrote "palatal"
that of course should have been "cerebral" and should have been as follows:



>
>(Harvard-Kyoto convention used in the following)
>
>Whitney in his Grammar (section 143. first paragraph) says "the [cerebral]
>N
>is allowed [as a permitted final] but is quite rare;"
>
>MacDonell in both his Sanskrit Grammar for Students and his Vedic Grammar
>for Students (section 27. both books) says that cerebral N does not occur
>as
>a permitted final.
>
>
>Do any of the list members know if there are actually any Sanskrit words
>ending in cerebral N in pausa and if so what they are?  And if so why
>MacDonell who published after Whitney would explicitly exclude them?
>
>As an aside Prof. Deshpande in saMskRtasubodhinI page 109 in describing
>external sandhi gives a rule for final N ("Final G, N, and n are doubled
>after  a short vowel, and before any vowel.")
>
>Yours,
>
>Harry
