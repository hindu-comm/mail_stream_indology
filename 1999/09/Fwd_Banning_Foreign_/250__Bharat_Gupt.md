Shri Vidyashankar has stated the political confrontation very well and there
can be doubt that Indian Government is stating a point of prestige rather than
a deep suspicion of all foreign scholars and of Indologists in particular.

HOWEVER, I feel that the Indian academics should impress upon the New Home Minister as
soon as he or she (there are surprises, once in a while) takes the oath to remove this
Ban, as there is no justification for it in terms of threat to security.

Inspite of its constrains, seminars and lectures etc and general academic and
intellectual activity in India is open and before the public gaze.
Indian academics are strong enough to confront any damaging propoganda that is feared to
be indulged in by foreign scholars, a beaucratic filter is not needed.
In fact, I am sure that the present order is at the ill advice of the administration and
is harmful to Indian academics more than any body else.
