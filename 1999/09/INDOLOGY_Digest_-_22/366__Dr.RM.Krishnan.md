I am new to this list. My full name is Ramasamy Krishnan (RM.K). I have been an observer for the past 3 weeks and
wanted to follow the postings to the extent I can understand,before I start contributing. Now I could not resist.

You call Indology the study of the NORTH part of what is now India, and the region of Pakisthan and Afganisthan. I
am completely surprised. What would you call the study of SOUTH part of India? Dravidology, perhaps!

With regards,
