I have been able to see only a few vols of the following dictionary in
Hindi. From the ones I have seen it is obvious that the work has been
published in the 1970's. Could someone inform me about the exact number of
vols and the years in which they were published (by the way, I found the
dictionary quite useful):

Siddhantashastri, Balchandra. Jaina-laksanavali. (an Authentic Discriptive
Dictionary of Jaina Philosophical Terms). Delhi: Vir Sewa Mandir. Vir Sewa
Mandir Series Text 15.
