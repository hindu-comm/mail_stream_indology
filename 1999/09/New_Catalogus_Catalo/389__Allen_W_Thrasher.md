Another reason the continutation of this tool (and it must be a
continuation, not just a 'completion,' because there will be new
catalogs produced indefinitely) is that it depends on and includes
information from  handlists produced by Raghavan (and others, I
believe) that are not published, and incorporating these into the NCC
adds much value beyond the potential of simply publishing the
handlists.
