Edwin Bryant panDita uvAca:

<<My favourite 'Oakism' is his etymology for 'England' It was thus named
because the primordial Aryan settlers fanning out across Europe from an
Indian homeland espied the fair isle (from which vantage point he does not
state) and called it 'Angulisthan' because it was finger- (anguli)
shaped!EB.>>

Not surprisingly, the city in Tennessee where exotic research is carried out
calls itself "Oak Ridge"! The "Ridge" is a corruption of
samskr*t r*Ci i.e. taste. "Taste of Oak" is "Oak Ridge"...

Regards,
Krishna
