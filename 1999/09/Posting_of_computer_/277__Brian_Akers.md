I, too, find these issues more important than acrimonious debates about
you-know-what. It seems they should fall within the scope of this list.

However, if they do not, maybe a separate forum, perhaps called _Indological
Publishing_ would be in order? It could deal with all facets of the process:

1) Computers: fonts, keyboard layouts, operating systems, transliteration
standards, etc.

2) Sources: locating critical (and other) editions, locating previous
translations, resolving copyright questions, etc.

3) Translations: requesting and receiving help with difficult passages, etc.

4) Other: perhaps also a meeting place for translators, authors, publishers,
editors, etc.

Excluded would be all topics extraneous to preparing and publishing
Indological works.

That's my two cents for now.
