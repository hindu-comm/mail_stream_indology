This is a comment on a mail meant for Dr. Wujastyk, but my name was mentioned.

That is not quite my point. It is rather this: The competing schools have been
discussing this matter over an extended period, and the discussion has reached
a stalemate. Which is why I suggest that we don't waste time on rehashing this
once more. I still miss a comprehensive theory from the indigenists which deals
with the whole I-E picture, and until such a theory is forthcoming, I don't
think that we can expect anything that is worthwhile from a discussion. In
other words: I did not say we should stop talking for ever. I said we should
take a prolonged pause.
