Thank you for paying attention to this issue; actually, this is your
seventeenth message this month, so you have slightly exceeded the quota.
K. Elst has the same number, but Bharat Gupt is the most frequent poster
this month so far, and has greatly exceeded the recommended limit. We can
expect to say goodbye to him for a while.

But again, thank you for being self-limiting.
