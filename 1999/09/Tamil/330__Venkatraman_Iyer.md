  Please advise your student to contact the Institute of
Asian Studies at Madras. There, s/he can get fully trained
in Tamil and other Indian languages. It is in the suburbs
of South Madras enroute to Mahabalipuram. Many Japanese and Americans
learn Tamil and other languages there and several books
by Brenda Beck, Zvelebil, J. R. Marr, ... have been published by IAS.
The Jl. of the IAS running for 12+ years has articles by
many reputed Dravidologists like I. Mahadevan, A. Veluppillai
of Uppsala university, ... IAS is an Institute attached to
the University of Madras. Recently, they are given responsibilty
for the Virtual Tamil University by TN Govt.
