I read somewhere that the Agastya Samhita talks about "electricity and methods of making dry battery cells". 

Is it correct?

If it is correct, what was the purpose of making "electricty and dry battery cells". 

Is there any purpose or use of these battery cells discussed in the Agastya Samhita?

Could anyone please enlighten me?

Regards/Kailash Srivastava
