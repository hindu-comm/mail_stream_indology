The issue is not that different opinions or interpretations are being
expressed, but that many people are being just plain rude and unprofessional
in doing so. This is not really useful in furthering knowledge. In fact, it
probably discourages many of those who would otherwise learn or contribute
to real knowledge.

It would be helpful to everyone, scholars and novices alike, if participants
could accurately quote their references, especially on emotionally charged
issues such as this. Only then can others have a firm foundation for
legitimate contributions and beliefs.
