Please tell us the Samskrutam name by which Jainas refer to
Thirukkural. Give the reference, it may be from ka. naa. subramanian's
work on thiruvalluvar where ka.naa.cu tries to show that the author
is jain. Where is the opinion the "Thiruvalluvar was just the
publisher" expressed?

Regards,
V. Iyer
