Yes, there is a long tradition by Saivaites, Vaishnavaites,
Jains, Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians to claim
Valluvar as their own.

   Helaachaarya seems to a vEL; kuNDakuNDa also is
a vEL/vELir. Agastya, the kalasha/kuNDa muni, is
said to have led the vELir of the Krishna clan to the South.
So says a sangam text (puRam).

   Aside: From the http://www.tamil.net archives,
   Newton's laws of motion in the comapact kuRaL meter.
   The kuRaL metrics was probably invented by Thiruvalluvar.

1) A body remains in its state of rest, or in constant motion unless
acted upon by an external force.

   vazicelcIrk kETum, nilaippERu mARRum
   veLivicai illAyin2 il.

2) Force is mass times acceleration.

   toTukkum vicaiyin2 aLavAm poruNmai
   muTukkam ivaRRin2 perukku.

3) For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

   uNTAm etirvin2ai evvin2ai tORumE

Best,
V. Iyer
