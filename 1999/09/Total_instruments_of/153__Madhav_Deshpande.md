Such ugly debates, as we are witnessing on this network, are not new to
the Sanskrit tradition.  The Advaitins wrote works titled
Madhvatantramukhamardanam, the Dvaitins wrote Tarkataa.n.davam, the
Buddhists wrote Tarka-jvaalaa, and Jagannaatha wrote Manoramaa-
kucamardinii.  The only instrument against such ugly debates is the use of
the DELETE key on the keyboard.  If any one needs advice in Sanskrit:
                duurato vaa visarjanam
