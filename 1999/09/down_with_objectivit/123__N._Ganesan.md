It is true that many Indian participants in
the debate have so far neglected the non-Indian part of the IE family
(a kind of pubescent self-absorption in a society emancipating
itself from interiorized colonial perceptions), and that some
non-linguists have erroneously denied the very principle of
linguistic reconstruction and the IE language family.  No matter,
for their work on non-linguistic aspects of
the matter has been useful, and others can supply the linguistic
dimension.

  Dravidianists are th ones who point out many linguistic
inconsistencies esp. in the out-of-india model.
Increasing the no. of Dravidology positions in the West
is one way to see whether out-of-India theory is correct.
