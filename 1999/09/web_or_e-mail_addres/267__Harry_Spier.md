Dear list members,

Can someone give me the webpage or e-mail address for Carl Winter
publishers.  I tried the following web and e-mail address which I found on
the internet but they appear to be wrong or out-of-date.
www.winter-verlag-hd.de and info at winter-verlag-hd.de.  Better yet is there a
bookdealer in the U.S. who can supply there publications.

Yours,

Harry
