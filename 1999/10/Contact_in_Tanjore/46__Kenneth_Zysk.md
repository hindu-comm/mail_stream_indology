I am trying to obtain copies of Sanskrit manuscripts from the Tanjore
Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library in Tanjore.

I should therefore appreciate assistance in obtaining an address (incl.
Email & FAX) and appropriate contact person at the library.

Guidance in this matter is very much welcomed.

Many thanks,

Ken Zysk
