    The fact that experts of Tamil historical linguistics and
lexicography are not included points to a big vacuum. Tamil lexicon
(produced in 1920s), DED, and Sanskrit dictionary accurately
analysing Dravidian loans, - all need to be brought uptodate.

   Long ago, F. Max Mueller recognized Tamil's place in his Prefatory
Note to the book, Hindu manners, customs and ceremonies by the
Abbe J. A. Dubois, OUP: "Nor it must be forgotten
that while the real revival of Sanskrit studies took place in
Bengal, the Abbe Dubois spent the whole of his life in the
Dekhan and in the Madras Presidency. He was therefore, as may
be seen by his translation of the Panchatantra, under the title
of Le Panchatantra ou les cinq ruses, Fables du Brahme Vichnou-
Sarma; Aventures de Paramarta et autres contes, le tout traduit
pour la primiere fois, Paris, 1826, a Tamil far more than a
Sanskrit scholar, and well acquainted with Tamil literature, which
hitherto has been far too much neglected by students of Indian
literature, philosophy, and religion."

Kind regards,
V. Iyer
