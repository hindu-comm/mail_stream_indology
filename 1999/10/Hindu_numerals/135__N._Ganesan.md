The numerals that we use today, 1,2, ... are called Hindu numerals.
Said to reach Europe via the Arabs.

Are there any references, theses, etc., which compare the symbols
of the numbers from different parts of India (epigraphy), the Arab
authors' works describing the Hindu numerals, and those in Europe
(eg., Durer, 1500 AD). Possibly, in the period 1000-1500 AD.

Thanks for references,
N. Ganesan
