The movie scene with a secular oath-taking conforms to a special provision
in Indian law which is owed to Annie Besant, who successfully agitated for
it in England, years before she came to India.  It is in the same category
as the civil wedding which the state provides in case a religious wedding
(otherwise recognized as legally valid) is objected to, e.g. in cases of
interreligious marriage.  Needless to say, it is hardly part of Hindu
"tradition".

Yours sincerely,
