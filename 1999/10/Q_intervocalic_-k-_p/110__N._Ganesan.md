There are several Brahmins who interacted extensively with Europeans.
The brahmin assistants of Colin Mackenzie around 1800 AD come to mind.

have married Europeans. Eg., Rukmini Devi Arundale and in Asian studies
depts.

Many African Americans, even though they have lived for centuries
in Canada and USA, remain black in color.
