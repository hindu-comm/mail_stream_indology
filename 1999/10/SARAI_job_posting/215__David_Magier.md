Date: Tue, 26 Oct 1999 16:56:17 -0400

Berlitz GlobalNET is searching for individuals who may be interested in
working as freelance interpreters for our company.  We are especially
looking for individuals all over the United States who may speak various
South Asian languages.  Some of the languages we currently need in
particular are Bhutanese, Baluchi, Bengali, Burmese,  Gujarati, Kannada,
Malayalam, Marathi, Nepali, Sinhalese, Sindhi, Tamil, Telegu, and Tibetan
(although speakers of other languages are encouraged to inquire also.)  The
work offers a very competitive hourly pay rate, and the schedule is flexible
(so you could work as much or as little depending on your current schedule).
Interpreter candidates should also be either U.S. citizens or permanent
residents.  For more information, please contact:
