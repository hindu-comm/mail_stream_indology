No, it definitely was Austro-Italian -- Harrison himself says so in
his report on tabo which he kindly sent to me a while back -- I'm
sorry I don't have time to dig it out to see where it was published.

Yes, in a few days time he will be giving a series of lectures on
early Sukhavati material.

Best wishes,
