Refer the 2nd last mantra of the 19th book of the Atharvaveda (saunakiya)
"stuta maya varada vedamata pavamani dvijanam...."
The second line mentions the following blessings of the Vedamata: Ayu,
praja, pashu etc. which relate to Non-Brahmins as well.

Hope this helps

I have been trying to figure out where the term dvija' /
dvijAti first begins to appear referring definitely to *a member
of any of the three upper varNas*, as distinguished from its use as a
synonym for 'brahmin' or a label acknowledging the fact that one has
undergone upanayana (but without clear reference to birth-status).

By "early" I mean prior to the Manu Smrti, esp. the
mantra-period-texts, brAhmaNa texts, lit. and the ritual
sutras.
