> I have been trying to figure out where the term dvija' /
> dvijAti first begins to appear referring definitely to *a member
> of any of the three upper varNas*, as distinguished from its use as a
> synonym for 'brahmin' or a label acknowledging the fact that one has
> undergone upanayana (but without clear reference to birth-status).
>
> By "early" I mean prior to the Manu Smrti, esp. the
> mantra-period-texts, brAhmaNa texts, lit. and the ritual
> sutras.
