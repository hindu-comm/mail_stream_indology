The trouble with ali as "bee" is, in what way does a
bee characterize a type of sevakAdhama?

A bee usually is seen positively because of its
pleasant buzzing sound and its associations with
flowers and honey, what to speak of the western image
of a "busy bee."

puSpAt puSpAntaraM vrajet
jJAnalobhAd tathA ziSyaH

It is also associated with inconstancy and fickleness
in the erotic mood.

And with foolishness apparently,

"The bumblebee is known to be a fool or blockhead,
and the cuckoo, one maintained by others, is a lowly
slave.
If these two are the harbingers of the sweet season,
then what further knavishness can we expect from it?"
