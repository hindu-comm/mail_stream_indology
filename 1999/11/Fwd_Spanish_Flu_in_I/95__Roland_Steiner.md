Subject:                Spanish Flu in India 1918-1919

Does anyone know of any literature, historical reports or novels,
etc, based on this tragic phase of Indian history, killing 16 million
(sic) people? This is for an acquaintance of mine who thinks that
this has somehow been suppressed and is looking for anything
on the subject. Thanks in advance for any help.
Jay Soni
