It's perhaps worth noting that Coward's is written from a "study of
religions" point of view, and he is interested in finding parallels
between Indian ideas of spho.ta and, for example, St John's gospel on
logos, etc.  I would not say that Coward penetrates the Indian tradition
on spho.ta very deeply.
