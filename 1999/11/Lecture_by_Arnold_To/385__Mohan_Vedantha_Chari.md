Dear Members of the Indology netwoork-
I would be grateful if someone could advise me as to how I may procure a
copy of a lecture by the eminent British historian Arnold Toynbee.
The lecture is said to have been delivered to the Philosophical Society of
Edinburh University in November 1952.
Mohan V. Chari.
