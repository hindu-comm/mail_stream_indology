I suppose you are referring to the "Terminologie der fruehen philosophischen
Scholastik in Indien", of which two volumes have appeared so far, published by
the "Verlag der Oesterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften".

The project is conducted by Gerhard Oberhammer, Ernst Prets and Joachim
Prandstetter. For further information you could perhaps contact Ernst Prets
(Ernst.Prets at oeaw.ac.at).
