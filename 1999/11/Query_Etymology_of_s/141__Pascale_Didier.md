Dear Subscribers,


i am looking for the etymology of the sanskrit (or pali) word
"aham"= I.

further i would have a question to the instrumental Form of "aham":
maya.

Does this instrumental Form from aham "maya" have any
etymology relation to the substantiv "maya = illusion"?

Thanks for your answer,

sincerely,

Pascale Didier
