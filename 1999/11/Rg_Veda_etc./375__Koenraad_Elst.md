Dear Mr. Sergei Schmalz, Dear Mr. Francis Parmar,

You seem to be unaware that the topic of the Aryan invasion theory has been
banned from this list.  Anyway, Prof. Dinesh Agarwal's text pointed out by
you is not bad but it is a bit obsolete.  The debate has moved on.  For a
discussion of recent contributions including the Sergent and Deshpande &
Bronkhorst books, I invite you to visit my website:

Your comments are welcome at koenraad.elst at pandora.be, but not on this list,
please.


Yours sincerely,

Dr. Koenraad Elst
