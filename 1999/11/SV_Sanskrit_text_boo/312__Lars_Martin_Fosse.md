For beginners, you may want to try

Walter Harding Maurer. The Sanskrit Language. An Introductory Grammar and
Reader.  Curzon Press. 1995.

In the Teach Yourself series, there is Coulson's Teach Yourself Sanskrit.

Both these books are very commendable. There are others as well, but I have no
personal experience with them. Jan Gonda has written a short Skt. grammar with
some texts which is useful for reference, although not good for self-study.
Maurer has also been working on a book with Sanskrit texts for intermediate
students, I believe.

Best regards,
