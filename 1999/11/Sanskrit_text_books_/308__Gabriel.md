Dear friend,
                     This is Gabriel, from The Sanskrit Web Site
(http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/3502/index.html). Go to
http://www.vedanta.org
 They have a catalog on line, search for Sanskrit Studies or something. You
can buy books on line or by sending a money order. Good luck and keep
teaching Sanskrit.
