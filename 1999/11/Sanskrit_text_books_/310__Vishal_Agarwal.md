Sanskrit Subodhini of Dr. Madhav Deshpande is a very refreshing edition. It
is in English-Sanskrit

Subject: Sanskrit text books info needed

Can anyone help me with a list of text books which I can use to teach
sanskrit.  I am trying to teach 2 levels - beginners, and intermediate.  I
studied using Indian books long time back.  I am trying to teach here in US
so that children and adults can learn the language.  I guess an english-
version would be good for students to follow.  I dont know where to look.

thanks

Krishna Kalale
