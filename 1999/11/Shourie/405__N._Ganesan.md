Dear listers,

How is the last name Shourie as in Arun Shourie explained from
Punjabi? Is it related to Kuru country?, k & sh are interchangeable
in Vedic and Tamil (s/sh written in ta. as 'c')? Is it connected with
kulUTa, ulUTa, kuli(/u)dhara in Vedas? How is panchAla toponym
and pancha-jana in RV explained? In tamil, ko.lu = plough share,
u_lu = "to plough", u_lavar = farmer, ... (These words of farming
are several orders of magnitude important in CT than nAJcil).

Regards,
N. Ganesan, PhD
