Hello Stephen,

I mentioned the loan phonology not from the point of etymologizing. In the
absence of any easily available Sanskrit-Tamil Dictionary,  I was pointing
out a work-around to help you use the Tamil lexicon as a Sanskrit-Tamil
dictionary, albeit in a limited way. For instance, if you wanted a Tamil
equivalent of stotra, you can look at the Tamil entry tOttiram, and you will
find the entry marked as < stotra and the Tamil synonym pukazcci. If the
Sanskrit words you are interested deal with religion, chances are you will
find the Tamil equivalents of many of them this way.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
