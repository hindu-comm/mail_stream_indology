Can any kind soul please send me the Samskrt original of the
subhAzita which goes as
" varameko guNiputro" and ends "tArAgaNo'pica"

and translates as:

  It is better to have one good son than (many/100) useless ones.
  Just as one sun outshines the whole collection of stars


The scholar who will help me out a critical juncture will have his/her
puNya increase a 1000-fold...

Regards,
Krishna
