The term shramaNa (monk) is used in Jaina works in contrast to
the term shrAvaka (a pious householder). It appears to have been
derived from the root shram, to toil, and signifies one who is
devoted to a variety of penance and vows in their fullest sense
(mahAvrata) as against a shrAvaka who practises vows in a limited
sense (aNuvrata).
