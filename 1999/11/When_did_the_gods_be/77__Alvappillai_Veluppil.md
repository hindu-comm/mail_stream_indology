Nanda Chandran writes:-

" Also the long history of Southern Indian
Kings, who regularly raided Lanka and devastated its Buddhist culture - not
a strong indication of any favorable disposition towards Buddhism - infact
the evidence seems to support rank animosity. The local cultures too show
none of the Buddhist traits - vegetarianism for example".

He seems to suggest that local cultures in South India do not show the
Buddhist trait of vegetarianism.
Vegetarianism is not a trait of Buddhism. It is not an aspect of the Lankan
Buddhist culture. Very few Lankan Buddhists are vegetarians.
