Dear Peter Wyzlic,

        I have here before me the first volume of the 2-volume edition of the
Matsya Purana published by Nag Publishers (First Edition, 1983). As far as I
understand, N.S. Singh is the publisher, but the translator is H.H. Wilson.
At least the preface was written by him. But "Irren ist menschlich", so that
I can be well wrong.

Your ever well-wisher,
Sergei Schmalz.
