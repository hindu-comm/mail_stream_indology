I have no problems with the Munda contributions; The problem is
when experts in old and new IE, IIr, IA with their deep expertise
of those texts treat Munda and Dravidian on par. Probably because
they are not that knowledgeable of either Munda or Dravidian texts.
At times, the Munda explanations have an equally valid Dravidian
ones which are ignored.

Probably you will agree that Dravidian philology is not
as advanced as that of Sanskrit due to various reasons in Europe
for the last 200 yrs. Along with D. Stampe's Munda etymological
dictionary, Dravidian texts' study has to adavnce lot further
for a proper (re)evaluation of the Indian past.
