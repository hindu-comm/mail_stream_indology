  If I understand correctly,from what I remember of my reading of
Lin Yu-Tang's "Wisdom of China and India", many of the features of dragons
were borrowed from Hindu/Buddhist mythology though dragons seems to be have
been a Chinese creation.

  Wonders do occur! Once in a bluemoon, the Hinduttvavaadis actually have it
right!!!!!
