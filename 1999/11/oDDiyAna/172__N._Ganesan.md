Dr. Lokesh Chandra is an eminent historian of Buddhism.
His article is fairly old, written in 1979.
To my knowledge, Dr. L. Chandra is not an etymologist.
and he is editor of seminal Buddhist texts from China,
Tibet, .... He is based in Delhi and does not read Tamil.

Indologists are welcome to read his article in full
and comment on them.

Regards,
N. Ganesan, PhD

Aside: 1500 yrs. old Tantric and Buddhist works exist in Tamil,
though not well known to Indological scholarship. Not yet, at least.
