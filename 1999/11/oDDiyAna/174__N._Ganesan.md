Dear Mr. Hodge,

Interesting. Looking forward to read your paper.

Ch. X of the GaNDavyUha talks of a KalyANamitra site,
SamudravetAlIpradesha. The teacher is Ashaa of
SamantavyUham udyAnam. Probably, vetAlI, aashaa, udyAnam
go together. (?). In the next chapter, in the same region
- samudravetAlI, Rishi Bhishmottaranirghosa resides in the
Naalayur nAma janapadah. Probably the nAlayuur refers to
the Ur in the Nallamalai range (ta. naL-/tel. nal- means
black) from which River Krishna(Krishnaveni/kannapeNNA)
flows.

>â€‰From tamil classical texts and other material, I think
I have clues for several kalyanamaitra sites in the Gv.
The South Indian sites mainly fall in two clusters:
Ch. III-XI and XXIII- XXXII.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
