It is not the policy of the INDOLOGY list to publish reproductions of
articles.   Please do not do this.  Post the URL by all means, but not the
full text.

If you have yourself written an article, and you wish it to come to the
attention of the INDOLOGY readership, by all means contact me privately,
and we can negotiate the possibility of mounting your text on the INDOLOGY
website.
