Dear Ms. Heinrich,

I am sending you off the list (to save band space) the results of two
library searches, one off the Library of Congress public catalog and
the other off the online union catalogs OCLC and RLIN
(simulatenously).  Please contact me off the list for interpretation
or other help.

Allen Thrasher
