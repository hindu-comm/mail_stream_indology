Hello Indologists,
        Greetings!
        I am rejoining Indology after a month-long break from it during my
visit to Pune.  Just want to mention two recent publications I acquired at
Pune, some of the best from India in recent years:

        1.      The Vedic People : Their History and Geography
                Rajesh Kochhar
                Orient Longman Ltd.  Delhi,
                2000
        2.      Advent of the Aryans in India
                Ram Sharan Sharma
                Manohar Publishers and Distributors
                Delhi
                1999

        Best,
                                        Madhav Deshpande
