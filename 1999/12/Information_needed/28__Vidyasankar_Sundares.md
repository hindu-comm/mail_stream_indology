The URL as given won't work. Amazon.com detects your IP address and the kind
of browser you use, to add all those numbers at the end. The simplest
recourse is to go to www.amazon.com and type in "matilal" in its search
facility. Also, note that most of the titles are out of stock or marked as
"special order," which means that it will take a long time to get to you.
Interlibrary loan requests would provide access to the older titles and also
might work faster.
