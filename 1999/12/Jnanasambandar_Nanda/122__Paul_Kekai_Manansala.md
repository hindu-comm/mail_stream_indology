My problem with your arguments is that they seemed to refer mainly to
the ancient situation.

Over the last few centuries it would be very hard indeed to portray
brahmins as bowl or skull carrying beggars.

In the last century they have been among the most privileged economic
groups and by far the most privileged in terms of political power and
education.

Whatever was the case in "Vedic" society, the situation today is a
result of caste rules seemingly formulated by brahmins, and in which
brahmins today appear the greatest benefactors.
