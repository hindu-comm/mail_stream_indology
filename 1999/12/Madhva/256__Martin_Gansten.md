I don't have the TMK either, but SMS Chari in his 'Fundamentals of
Visistadvaita Vedanta' (based on the TMK) quotes the same passage, stating
that 'This view is held by a section of Visistadvaitins and Madhvas'.
Desika refutes it, however, and I doubt that one could find much in
Ramanuja's writings to support a nityasamsaarin doctrine.
