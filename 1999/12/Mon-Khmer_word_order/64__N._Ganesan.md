B. Comrie, etal., The Atlas of Languages, 1997, p.58,
"In India and Pakistan, the Indic languages have come into
contact with Dravidian languages, from which they acquired
features such as retroflex consonants and strict verb-final
word order. The Dravidian languages in turn have borrowed
Indic vocabulary."

Do the Munda languages also have a SOV word order?
What about their cousins: Do the Mon-Khmer languages also have
SOV word order? From the above reference, it appears
Mon-Khmer does *not* have "strict verb-final word order".

Thanks for references on Mon-Khmer word order,
N. Ganesan
