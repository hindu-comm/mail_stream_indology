Dear Vishal,

My thought is cross-cousin weddings were important in the North
in ancient times - Otherwise, they would not have been noted
in the hagiographies of important personages like Krishna and Buddha.
Of course, the dharmashastras which are several centuries *late*
treat them as exceptions.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
