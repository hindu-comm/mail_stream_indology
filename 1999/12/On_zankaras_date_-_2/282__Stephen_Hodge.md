There are also the Buddhist traditions preserved in Tibetan sources
that places Shankara around the time of the Yogacarin Dharmapaala and
the logician Dharmakiirti.  The latter is said to have engaged
Shankara in debate.  Some aspects of the accounts are likely to be
apocryphal but still suggest the above quoted dates are at least 120
years too late.

Best wishes,
