Assuming that we are still talking of the Vedantic tradition, such a tenet
(involving a sa-aadi-samsaara) would seem very difficult to uphold in the
face of Brahmasutra 2.1.35: na karmaavibhaagaad iti cen naanaaditvaat. In
fact, I don't think I have heard of any school of Indian philosophy
accepting a 'beginning to samsaric existence'. Have you?
