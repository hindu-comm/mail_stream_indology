I, for one, find Mr. Ganesan's emails almost invariably among the most
interesting and perceptive on the list.  He's worth the price of admission
by himself , the "price" being the plethora of messages from all and sundry
one must take a look at.  Some people on this list are too arrogant and
intolerant of other people's interests.  Live and let live.
