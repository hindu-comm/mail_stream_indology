Interested in the history of the seven-day week in India;
Will Zerubavel's book have it? Interestingly, tamil has unique
names for most of the names of the week. The names of 27 nakshatras
and days in a week (It may not be a 7 day week) may go much back.
When does 12 month cycle a year start in India?
References on the month names and their origins
please. Tamil has a cycle of 60 years where the names of those
are completely in Sanskrit.

Guidance, references sought for the seven day week, naming of
the days in a week, month names, year-cycle names - their history
in India.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
