  BTW, his name was KuppaNNa Sastry. In Tamil, the additional
-p- makes difference.

  Now that the RV, in its present linguistic form, is dated to
1000 BCE, Shri. Kuppanna Sastry, the erudite Sanskrit scholar,
is probably wrong in his dating. The VJ is plausibly 2-4 centuries
CE. It is not uncommon among Tamils to optimistically date anything.
Have seen dates of TolkAppiyam, Vedas, etc., to 30,000, 8000,
3000 BCE.
