The 'bones and flesh' of Indology work is an intimate knowledge of
Indian texts; Not many places in the world have a variety of writings
as obtained in India at different time depths. Prof. Hubey may not be
an  expert on any Indian language. Some consider Indian languages
essential to theorize about India.
