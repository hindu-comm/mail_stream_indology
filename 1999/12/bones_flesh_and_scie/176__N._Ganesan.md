In Dynamics, Chaotic systems and Strange attractors, etc., happen
with even a slight change in the initial conditions. Aren't the
language change within a populace highly nonlinear and complex?
Always, scientists try to linearize a nonlinear system within
an operational range and make predictions. Sound change law
may be one such device to handle language change.

Dixon, The rise and fall of languages, mentions Nostratic theory's
problems. Is it correct that not even a few academics of Historical
Linguistics value Nostratic theory much? Only dictionary comparisons,
but not much progress in grammar.
