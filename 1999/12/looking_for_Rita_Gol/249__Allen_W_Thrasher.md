Could anyone help me in finding Rita Goldman, who was at the U.S.
Embassy in Kathmandu in the 1950s?  State Dept. sources have not been
able to help me.  A cultural institution in Nepal would like to
contact her in connection with tapes she made of the great Nepali poet
Laxmi Prasad Devkota.

Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
