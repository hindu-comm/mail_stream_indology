Sari is a prominent cultural symbol of India and, it derives
from zATI/ZATikA. sArI < zATI, much like Dharwar < Dharwad where wAD
(skt. vATika < ta. pATi).

Marathi has chATI; Panini: zATI-paTTika, zATI-paTIra,
zAtI-pracchada; Katyayana: zATaka; Patanjali: zATakaM;
Dhammapatha: ajina-sATI (v.394); Pali: sATa, sATikA, sATiya;
Jain: sADa, sADiA; Prakrit: sADi... (Indology archives).
The variations, z/s/ch and T/D suggest this word is
a borrowal.

Prof. K.S. Arjunwadkar wrote earlier:
>Paanini's list of roots does note a root 'shaT' (I P.) meaning 'to be sick,
>to divide, separate, to be dissolved, to be weary or dejected,
>to go' and a root 'shaT' (X A.) meaning 'to praise, flatter' (Apte's
>Dictionary). As in the case of many words, it is difficult to relate
>the root-meaning to the meaning of the derivative in use.

Pl. look at tamil words:
1)kATikam = sAri 2) kATakam = sAri
(p. 425, N, KathiraiverpiLLai's Tamil-Tamil dictionary,
6th reprint, Delhi:AES, 1990). Also, in OTL.
kATikam/kATakam(=sAri) could be found in old Tamil literature.

A noun kATi(=sAri/dress to wear) is formed from the above tamil verb,
"kaTTu" which is attested in all Dravidian and in CT.
Many verb_to_noun pairs are formed in a like manner:
viTu(to leave) > vITu (home, mukti), mUTu(to close) > mUTi(cover),
nITTu(to extend, to prolong) > nITu (for a prolonged period of time)
etc., In a similar manner, ta. kaTTu(to tie as adornment) > ta. kATi
(=sAri).

>â€‰From 1) ta. paTu (to lay down) > skt. paTTa/paTTika and
2) dr. tamizh > dAmili/dramiDi/dramiDaka, ... and also, k -> s/z
is attested in Sanskrit and Tamil many a time (eg., karkoTa/zarkoTa,
ta. kaTTam(square)/caTTam(rectangular window frame, law < (verb)
kaTTu).

Hence, is drav. kATi > skt. zATI/zATa(ka)/sADI/chATI possible?
If so, the kATi(dr.)/zATI(skt) is probably what is seen on the
shoulders of the so called 'priest' of IVC and latter on the Buddha.
