It is natural that Indians use zATI(tamil kATikam) to cover the head
for protection from the hot tropical sun. May not be from Sudan,
Greece, Rome or Middle East. Also, ta. mukkATu = veil comes from the
verb pair: mukku(to immerse, to cover)/muGku(to be immersed/to
be covered). Mother goddesses (eg., Jain ambikA) in ancient sculpture,
Kishangarh/Kangra pgs., modern paintings of Sankara, Vallalaar
have the veil.

N. Ganesan
