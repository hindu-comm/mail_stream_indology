Yashwant,

Isn't the Greek and Roman practice of women covering their heads adopted
after Christianity was adopted?  I can't remember many statues of
ancient Greek or Roman women with covered heads.

Head coverings were worn in ancient times (by both men and women) in
Egypt and neighboring areas of East Africa, the Levant and North Africa.
Maybe originally as protection against the desert sun.

Regards,
Paul Kekai Manansala
