Thanks, I haven't seen these costumes before. It seems that pads
were often worn on top of the head under the veil.

I still can't help but feel that the head covering came more into
vogue after the beginning of the Muslim period. Looking at the artwork
you really get that impression although there were exceptions like
the Gandharan statues you mentioned earlier.

What keeps coming to mind are the paintings of Ajanta as compared to
the latter Rajput or Mogul works .

Paul Kekai Manansala
