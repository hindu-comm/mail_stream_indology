You might want to look into Bhartrhari's VairAgyashataka.  See also the
twentieth chapter of the ViSNudharmottarapurANa (Baroda:Oriental
Institute, 1958), which contains statements that vairAgya gives rise to
shAnta which in turn is conducive to moksa. Relevant verses are
translated into English in Masson and Patwardhan's SAntarasa and
Abhinavagupta's Philosophy of Aesthetics (Poona:Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute, 1969).
