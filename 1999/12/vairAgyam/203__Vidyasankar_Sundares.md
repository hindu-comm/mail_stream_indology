The earliest reference would probably be in Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 3. 5. 1,
which talks of giving up desire for sons, wealth etc. See also Jabala
Upanishad, "yad ahareva virajet tad ahareva pravrajet." There are many other
such Upanishadic texts, and of course, the commentaries in the Yoga and
Vedanta schools.
