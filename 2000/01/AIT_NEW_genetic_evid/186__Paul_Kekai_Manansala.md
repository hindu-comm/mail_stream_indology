There is a fairly high presence of -- in Punjabis.

Yes, just from the maternal side.

Haplotype M must have crossed over into Yemem because there aren't many
traces of it in the Levant.

Well, that's one of the points of my website at:

For the later haplotypes the probability would be very small indeed
because at the least you would have to multiply the probabilities of all
the ancestral haplotypes together.

Of course, in reality there is a somewhat Africoid substratum
everywhere. From the phenotypic standpoint, yes, there was also an
Africoid or "Oceanic Negroid" presence in Asia.

I doubt that mtDNA haplotype M in Africa and Asia are unrelated. The
chances of independent evolution occuring are extremely tiny because
we're speaking of multiple events each dependent on the previous one.
