>Message #88 As'va = Horse, ass (R.gveda)

Still  only mythology. Most dangerous for secure proof.... Needs detailed
study of the Azvins & Rbhus & Indra to come closer to a decision. Also, a
Vedic car made out of manas? and a Vedic tricycle??  :

>Generic) which seems to mention as'va only on the margin...

No, he always looks for *all*, divergent  expressions denoting a horse.
Misleading. Better:

Pokorny, J. Indogermanisches etymologisches Worterbuch, Bern/Munchen 1959
p. 301-302

which lists  relatives of azva (IE *ekwo-s, h1ekwo-s) from Iranian to
Keltic and Tocharian:

* in: Avestan, O. Persian, Ossetic; Greek, Thracian, Lycian; Latin,
O.Irish, O.Anglo-Saxon, O.Saxon, Gothic; Tocharian A +B --> Turkic;

* of fem. azvaa : in Avest., Lat., O.Lith.,

* of adj. azv(i)ya- in: in Avest., Greek, Lat., O. Prussian, Lithuanian.

* also in Pannonian, Illyrian, Tarentian, Epid.,  ...

It is no big news: if there is a well attested word  in virtually all IE
languages, it is the h1ekwo- the horse: Contra Rao quoted by Kalyanaraman...
