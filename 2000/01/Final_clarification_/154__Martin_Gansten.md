You are misquoting me. Please read what I actually said.

You are being as careless in reading my posts as in reading the Gita. I did
not deny that the Gita teaches that transmigration depends on karma. But
karma has neither beginning nor (natural) end; hence transmigration, in
this view, could not be an evolutionary process. The Gita contains no
explicit discussion of this theme (for which you may refer to the
Brahmasutra; see 2.1.35); but nor does it contradict the common view.

And now I really have nothing further to add.

Regards,
Martin Gansten
