Achaya has two books, one is a history of Indian cooking, and the other
a dictionary. The result is a very tantalizing one, for there is a lot
of information, interesting insights, but I, at least, got the feeling
that it did not make for a very coherent whole. There's lots of
interesting tidbits there, but there's plenty more to be done, I feel
(e.g., he does not address questions of etymology (eg sambar).
