I went to the web page of the Hare Krishna organization and there is a
Bhagavad Gita. You can view it either with graphics and without. And
yes, the illustrations seemed in the same spirit as those you
described. Why don't you check it out? It may be part of the
Mahabharata you are talking about, and maybe by browsing their site
there may be some indications about the real book.
