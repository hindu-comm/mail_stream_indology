It has recently been decreed that there was a year 0CE, though to
preserve continuity, dates x years from the zero point, x < 1,
are allowed to be considered as being in the year (roof(1-x))BCE.
Problem solved :-^

But, as the list members know, the new millennium began in 1943,
though it won't start till 2079.

However, the Real (with capital R) millennium (the sixth, or is
it 3894th?) began in 1899.

With a belated wish for happy new millennium to all,
Nath
