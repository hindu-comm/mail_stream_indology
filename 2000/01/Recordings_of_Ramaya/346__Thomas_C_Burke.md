Namaskar!

There is an old Folkways recording of several selections of  the Valmiki
Ramayana
(Folkways 09920, 1951), as recorded by S.R. Ranganathan, T.M.P. Mahadevan,
and Swami Nikhilananda.  If I recall correctly, these passages formed one
side of an LP record containing Sanskrit material.

This recording (I think on cassette) can now be ordered from Smithsonian
