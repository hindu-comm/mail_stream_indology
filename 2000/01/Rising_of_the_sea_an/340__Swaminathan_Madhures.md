I think the Milky ocean has more to do with Vishnu(MaayOn)/Krishna being
the Lord of the Mullai landscape. Vishnu who is dark in colour
(Kalidasa, inscriptions, literature, ...) is said to sleep on the
white-colored ocean; perhaps to add contrast.

Interested in the sources about volcanic activity
in the churning of the ocean legends, SM
