>PS: It will be nice to get a picture of the Angkorvat churning...K.

Dear Dr. Kalyanaraman,

You can scan a nice picture of the Indian myth of
the Milky sea churning in Kampuchea from the May 1982
issue of National Geographic. The relief is 160 feet long!
(The temples of Angkor, Will they survive?)

Yours sincerely,
V. Iyer
