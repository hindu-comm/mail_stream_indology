Some astronomers place Meru on the same meridian as Ujjain and others
on the same meridian with Lanka.  The former could support your
theory. The Chinese seemed to think that Meru was in the Kunlun range
which seems more in keeping with the Lanka meridian. However, sometimes
Ujjain and Lanka are placed on the same longitude so it's not exactly a
science.

The mountain though seems to be located in the northernmost region known
to ancient India.

The Bhavishya Purana explains that the Bhojakas offer food (bhoj)
to the Sun every day. They were the temple priests. They had a practice
of remaining silent while eating.

The Purana also has interesting discussion on caste stating that it
should not be a hindrance to spiritual growth. The examples given of low
caste persons who achieved success are Parasara, Vasistha, Mandapala and
Shukadeva.

So that's what happened to Gurupdesh. He also believes, following
Cunningham, that the Mauryans and Guptas had Western extra-Indian
origin. Considering that is used to be common practice to assign East
Indian culture (Neolithic, Copper Hoard, urban, etc.) to such
influences, he has a lot of published material to work with (but nothing
substanial).
