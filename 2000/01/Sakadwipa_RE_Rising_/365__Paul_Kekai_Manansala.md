Did you know that possibly one of the earliest instances of 'cow burial'
with the domesticated Bos indicus comes from inhumation burials at Non
Nok Tha dating from 4,000 to 3,000 BCE?

The burials usually included a socketed copper instrument on the chest,
together with pottery and animal bones including probably domesticated
dogs and pigs.

Most of the cattle bones were of young females suggesting some type of
ritual was involved.

The importance of copper in the burial is also noteworthy.
