Youri Martini asked:
>Who was Pedro Teixeira?

A Portuguese traveller who spent years in Asia, returned in 1601 and
published a travel account in 1610. Very little is known of him except what
he himself tells in his book. It was translated into English by W. F.
Sinclair and published by the Hakluyt Society in London in 1902.
