With all respect, I don't know how in the world you came to this
conclusion, Ravi!

You're too kind.  If indeed this instance has not been noted before, it
may be that it simply was not noticed. After all, Western and Indian
scholars are only human.

That would give the honor of discovery to you.  And your arguments
appear very sound. Are there any examples of this grouping of women,
vaisyas and sudras in pre-Gita texts?

Regards,
Paul Kekai Manansala
