It appears to me that the verse is giving an exception to a rule that
generally states that brahmins (and not brahmins/ksatriyas) are eligible
for liberation.

The question is then outside of the Gita do women need to reincarnate as
men to achieve liberation or can they achieve liberation at all?

Claude has given one view that they cannot, but isn't the general view
similar to that given by Ravi?
