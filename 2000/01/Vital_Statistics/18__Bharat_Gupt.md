It is a remarkably succint account of the Hindi-family (pl.dont translate as Parivaar),
working and that is the big future of Hindi as Films, tv, and music-lit,pop fiction and
even translations from other languages,  have shown inspite of all  political hurdles.
Perhaps Magadhi, Aavantika and Praacya and Udiicii may have functioned in a similar way,
more light can be shed by Prakritologists.

Warsaw seems to have the knack of hearing the true rumours. In future, Vidarbha from
Maharashtra and Tailangana from Andhra. This is the end of glosso-centric state carving
and recognistion of economic and administrative reasons for state formation. Let us hope
that there will be Chattisgarhi prize for poetry and Kumaonvi  prize for music, but the
states shall teach standard Hindi in schools and colleges.
