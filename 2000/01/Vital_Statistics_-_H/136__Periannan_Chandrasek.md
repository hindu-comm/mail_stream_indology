The dramatic drop in support for Hindi in the south above figures only
negates your point. Does it not?

There is no such thing as *the* national language of India and there will never
be one unless India is split into multiple sovereign states. There are nearly
15 *national languages* as recognized by the Constitution of India.

:-)) How scientific is this "survey"?

It is more important to preserve the furture of the native langauges and narrow
their scope than to kill them and sell their corpses to a larger audience.

Kamba ramayana has made its mark in the North; accorindg  to UVS Iyer in his
book "piRkAlattup pulavarkaL" a compendium of "latter day poets", Thulasidas
got inspired by kumarakurupara swamikaL's lectures on kampa rAmAyaNa  at the
varaNasi caiva mutt (which he established with the financial assistance of a
muslim ruler) to compose his version of ramayana.

And even Valmiki ramayaNa's Skt. version owes quite a bit to the Southern
tradition. From "The Poems of Ancient Tamil: Their milieu and Their Sanskrit
Counterparts" by George Hart, University of California Press, 1975, ISBN
0-520-02672-1" page 278 ("Tamil Elements in Indo-Aryan"):
"In the Ramayana and the Buddhacarita, these southern themes become quite
prominent, a fact partly responsible, I believe, for the Ramayana's
conventional position as the Adikavya, the first Sanskrit kavya. In my opinion
the relative newness of the southern poetic elements in the Ramayana and the
Buddhacarita accounts for their clumsy treatment in those two works, and, since
they are quite important for the effects the authors wish to achieve in those
works, this accounts at least in part for the inferior poetic quality of those
poems."

And under what compulsion did these influences take place?

If Indians truly care about India's cultural and political future, they should
stop imposing one langauge and one culture on unwilling and unneeding people.
There is such thing as cultural ecology just as there is biological ecology.
Let us preserve the germ plasms of different heritages of the world.
Let Indians undersatnd that unity is different from  uniformity.
