Can anyone point me to any useful secondary literature on the use of the
defective verb aaha with past sense (contravening Paa.nini
3.4.84+anuv.rtti)? Does anyone happen to know when the awkwardness of this
usage was first explained away by declaring aaha to be
`[kaalasaamaanyavaacakas] ti"nantapratiruupako nipaata.h'?
