The storey of christs resurrection, riding a white horse etc is much more
popular in christianity than in India and at a first guess the kalki avatAr
storey would seem to be a borrowing from christian mythology and would hint
at an early knowledge of christian texts in India.

Are there any opinions about this. Is it possible that christianity picked
up and elaborated on an oriental myth.
