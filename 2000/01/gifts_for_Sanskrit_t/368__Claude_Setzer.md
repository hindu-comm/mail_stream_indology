Dhoti, shawl, chAdar are the "standard" or even "obligatory" type of ritual
gift for many types of "Vedic" and ritual situations. It also seems that a
more"personal" gift suited to the specific situation might be very much
appreciated in addition to the "expected" type of formal gift. I once
brought an exquisite and very expensive shawl on behalf of someone else and
a luscious Mango on behalf of myself. The teacher was away from India and
had not had a good mango for along time. It happened that he was extremely
excited about the mango and pretty indifferent about the shawl.
