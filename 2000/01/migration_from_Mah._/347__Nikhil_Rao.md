Greetings to all,

While I know of several mahrashtrian families hailing
from the Thanjavur/Kumbakonam areas who speak Marathi
at home, I have a friend who is a tamil speaking
vadama brahmin hailing from Thanjavur, according to
him his family and several other families belonging to
the maudgalya gotra were imported from Nasik in Mah.
to perform rituals for the maratha kings of Thanjavur.
like most other tamil brahmins he is a
"yajusshakhaadhyaayi". Does anybody have suggestions
for references!

Thanks,
Nikhil
