vAcaspati's nyAya works, dated in the late 10th century, will pose
a problem for accepting 700 CE as Sankara's date. It is more likely
that Sankara flourished around 900 CE, give or take a few decades.

Also, Kunjunni Raja in ALB, v.24, 1960 has given arguments that
go against 700 CE date for Sankara. Kunjunni informs that
for Santarakshita (705-62) and Kamalasila (713-63), Sankara's
teachings were unknown.
