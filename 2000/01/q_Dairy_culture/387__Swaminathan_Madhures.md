China (and Vietnam) did not develop any dairy culture; Is it the same
with Southeast Asia also?

Generally pig-and-rice culture is Southeast Asia; Indonesia
like other SE Asia has hoary traditions of water buffalos.
But what about milk, butter, curds, cheese?, - do they have any long
history in SE Asia? Thanks for the info.

Still what is not clear is the fact that the Milky ocean churning myth
travels from West to East when the Indianization spreads.
And, no hint that Indians borrowed it from places like Hawaii.
