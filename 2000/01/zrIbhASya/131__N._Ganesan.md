"Ramanuja was to call Sankara a `crypto-Buddhist' (prachanna-bauddha)" [32]

[32] The definition can be found in Ramanuja's main work, his
commentary on Badarayana's Brahmasutra (see 'Sribha.sya, II.II.27)
(N. Isayeva, p. 14)

Does the Sribhashyam call Sankara as a "prachanna-bauddha"?

Regards,
N. Ganesan
