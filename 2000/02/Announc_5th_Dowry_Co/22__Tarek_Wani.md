Regarding N. Ganesan's question and Y. Malaiya's comments:

It is instructive to look at the figures for spousal (mostly wife) murders in a comparative fashion:

US. Roughly 5,000 for a population of less than 300 million

Russia. About 20,000 (according to Newsweek) for a
population of about 150 million

India. Roughly 5,000 for a population of 1,000 million

The details (rage, insurance fraud --which works like
dowry here-- for murder; and different factors for suicide) will vary from region to region.
