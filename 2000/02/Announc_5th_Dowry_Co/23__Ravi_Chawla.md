Enrica,
Yashwant is not joking.  This is even true today in many muslim cultures.
My prediction is that this will become true again in India and China in the
next tweny/thirty years.  In these countries many girls are now being
aborted before they are born.  This will lead to shortage of women.  After a
while, only way for a man to get a woman in marriage would be to pay some
price.  Older men with money will be able to pay that price while the
younger men , with less or no money, will have to wait.  Regards.  RChawla
