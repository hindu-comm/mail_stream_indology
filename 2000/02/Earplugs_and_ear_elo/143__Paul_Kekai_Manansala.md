Thank you for the reference. I will check it out as soon as possible.

In the astrological work, Kalaprakasika, it gives instructions for
earboring of children in their first year and states that a copper
needle and white thread must be used. These are the kinds of notices I'm
looking for and also on methods of stretching out the earlobe.

And diverging to a related topic, given the importance of copper in
brahmin rituals as discussed by SP here sometime ago, are there any new
theories out there connecting the development or roots of brahminism
with the Chalcolithic?

I believe that Kosambi was the first to suggest this connecting also the
importance of the zebu cattle and other cultural characteristics.

Regards,
Paul Kekai Manansala
