Vidya,

Lord Shiva becoming Mother type legend can be seen in common
Tamil personal names like Naachiyappa CheTTiaar, Taayumaanasundaram
Pillai or Aayi Goundan etc., In the puthuma.n.dapam of the Madurai
Meenakshi temple you can see a depiction of Shiva as a Mother Pig
feeding her piglets. For the Madurai mAtRbhUteshvara legendary
account, consult TiruviLaiyADal purANam.

Best,
SM
