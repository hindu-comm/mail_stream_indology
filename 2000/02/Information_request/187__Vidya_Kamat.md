<<I'm surprised no one has mentioned the Tamil legend of Siva disguising

himself as a vaiSya woman and breast-feeding a child, thereby becoming a

mother. Hence he is called tAyumAnavar (he who also became a mother),
Sanskritized as mAtRbhUta. There is a temple in Trichy dedicated to Siva
as
mAtRbhUteSvara.

Interesting. Can you direct me to the texual source (preferably along
with translated edition) of this myth?
Thanking you in anticipation.

sincerely,
Vidya
