>Interesting. Can you direct me to the texual source (preferably along
>with translated edition) of this myth?

As was pointed out on this list, and also to me in private, the story of
Siva becoming a mother does not include breast-feeding a child. Somehow, I
seem to have mixed up this legend in my mind with a completely different
one, where it is Parvati who provides milk to a child.
