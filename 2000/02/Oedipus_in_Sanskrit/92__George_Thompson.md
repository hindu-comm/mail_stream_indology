Just to clarify.  The person whose question I posted to the list was
intereested in evidence suggesting that Oedipus in Sanskrit might be cognate
with Oedipus in Greek [not the names, of course, but the stories, or perhaps
rather elements of the stories].  Evidence, in other words, suggesting that
the story may be Indo-European.

She did not express interest in Oedipal conflict in Sanskrit.  Nor have I.
My main interest in this is to forward references to her, as I had been asked
to do.
