Well Krishna, if all schools of vedanta said the same
thing, as the modern swamiji's and as the
Hindutva-vadi homogenizers of India would like us to
believe, then an acharya of old might have been
expected to be too ashamed or embarrassed to write a
polemical tract criticising another school of vedanta.

But that was not the case. Not only polemical tracts
were written; serious replies to these tracts were
written too. This is clear from the life and works of
Sri Venkatanatha, Mahacharya, Srinivasa et al.

Warm Regards,

LS
