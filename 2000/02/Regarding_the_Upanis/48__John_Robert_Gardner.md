Ah, but the boxer and the historian are not at odds, otherwise, the boxer
would be hit in the head for failing to remember the opponent's past, and
the historian would otherwise not be there to remind:

kavir manISI paribhUH svayambhUr
yAthAtathyato 'rthAn vadadhAc chAzvatIbhyaH samAbhyaH

and so it goes, then,

vidyAM cAvidyAM ca yastad vedobhayaM saha
avidyayA mRtyuM tIrtvA vidyayAmRtam aznute

with all due respect, of course, for historian and boxer--either wise
enough to ply their trade--know that the context in which an event--or
quote--occurs is inseparable from its relevance and meaning,
