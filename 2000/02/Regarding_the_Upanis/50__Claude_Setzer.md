I think both of these viewpoints have used adjectives too strong to keep the
"truth" of their points. It is very unfortunate that even scholars with the
highest reputation often translate incorrectly, even to the extent that a
fairly novice Sanskrit person can see their errors.

Reading in Sanskrit with several translations of others at hand (especially
annotated ones) will almost always give a more accurate reading than
trusting any one person, no matter who it is.
