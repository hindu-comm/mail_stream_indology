Dear Shri. Tilak,

The beautiful song you mentioned was composed by Dr. G. B. Palsule  many years
ago when he was working in Deccan College. It has been a practice in Pune and
elsewhere to sing this song in praise of the Sanskrit language on the occasion
of the National Sanskrit Day. I shall request one of those ladies who usually
sing the song to prepare an audio cassette and send it to you along with the
text.
