I would like to ask a few questions to Scholars in this list.
1. Most of the traditions in India and eating habits are alive even today right
from Vedic times. How is it that eating flesh of the so called "Sacrificial
Horse" is not there?

2. Apart from text of Vedas and some Puranas (which derive from Vedas) are
there any prper indications that Horse flesh was eaten by Indo-Aryans?

I am constrained to ask these questions because, at least in RigVeda and
YajurVeda, the meaning of the word Ashva is not "Horse" that is an animal. It
has entirely different meaning. Without access to that meaning any discussion
that we notice in this list is futile.

Sorry if I sound arrogant. All of you are great schoalrs, but I find you are
going astray.
