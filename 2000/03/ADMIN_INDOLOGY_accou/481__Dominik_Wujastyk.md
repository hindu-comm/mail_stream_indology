I've finally got fed up with the insulting tone of some posters on this
list.  From now on, I shall summarily unsubscribe any member who -- in my
judgement -- insults or slights another member of the list.

I am uncertain how effective this will be in practice, but let's see.

I shall not engage in discussion about my decisions in this matter.
