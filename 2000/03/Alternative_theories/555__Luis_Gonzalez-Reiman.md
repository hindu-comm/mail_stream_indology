Right, so do Indologists, provided the findings warrant it.

It's good that you clarified this, because it certainly looks like you do
have a decided opinion. You are using it as one of your arguments against
the JV date.

It is interesting that you should say this.  You come across as trying to
defend (almost) every alternative explanation, even if you sometimes agree
they are far-fetched. Is it because of the shock value you think they might
have against "the establishment"?  To question assumptions is part of the
process of research, and this implies looking at alternative explanations.
 But if you pile up alternative explanations that don't have firm bases you
end up with a house of cards.  It could become iconoclasm for iconoclasm's
sake (maybe a strong Uranus?).
