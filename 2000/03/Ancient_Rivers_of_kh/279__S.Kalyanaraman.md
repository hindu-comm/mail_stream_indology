My response on etyma and semantic tracks is posted at
http://sarasvati.listbot.com View Archives Message #96 (since the size
is 7.2k and too much for this list). Longer responses (upto 200k) can be sent
to sarasvati at listbot.com which will automatically get posted on the Archives.

Would deeply appreciate further comments and suggestions. Yes, indeed,
linguistics (phonetics, semantics and transformational grammar) is what
indology has for 'science', however, imperfect... On semantics vs. phonetics,
later...
