Dear All,
I am looking for any mention (either in an inscription or in literature) of
the aSvamedha sacrifice being performed in North India and/or the
Kasmir/Gandhara region. I am particularly interested in the second and third
centuries. As I have just started to look, I was wondering if someone out
there could point me toward some good sources for this material.
Thanks in advance,

Joseph
