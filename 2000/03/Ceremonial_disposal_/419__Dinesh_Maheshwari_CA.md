Are there any direct or indirect references in the Vedic texts regarding
the disposal of the "asva" carcass?
Considering the significance of the "asva"  in the "Vedic culture", could
the "asva" carcasses have been disposed off (buried, cast off in the
river/sea, cremated) ceremoniously ?

Thanks,

Best Regards,
Dinesh Maheshwari
