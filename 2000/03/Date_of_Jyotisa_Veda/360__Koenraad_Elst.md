Not at all: not counting myself, Rajesh Kochhar is only the latest in a long
list to date it unequivocally ("uncritically"?) at ca. 1300 BC.

Why should a manual instructing priests in the astronomical aspects of their
rituals point to stellar positions of a thousand years earlier rather than
those actually visible, esp. when the matter at hand is not too complicated
and the instruction given could be falsified at the first implementation?

This lack of precision is a valid point, but it works in both time
directions: with the same probabaility, it could push the date to 2000 BC.

it cannot, it is only in spite of and against its astronomical data that the
VJ can be placed in the early centuries BC

but a consequential one, especially in a manual of astronomy.  It is harder
evidence than much else on which indological chronology relies, e.g. the
fabled "sheet-anchor" of Indian chronology, the Megasthenes-Sandrokottos
synchronism, in which the all-important identity of "Sandrokottos" is much
less clear than is conventionally assumed.  On that identification rests a
lot, partly also the belief that classical Sanskrit as used in the VJ is
typical of the centuries around Christ.
