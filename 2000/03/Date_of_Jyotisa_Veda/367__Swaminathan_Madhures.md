Prof. Witzel's hypothesis of making Munda as the high language
of IVC will be contended by Dravidologists in the future. Many
unanswered questions and problems in that. Dravidian linguistics
and philology are nascent fields, not any Professorships at all!
Academic dravidology is miniscule compared to well entrenched
IA/IE studies.

Foll. Prof. Parpola, what about the Fish symbol as Star in IVC?
Also, how to explain Retroflexion in IVC and later?
