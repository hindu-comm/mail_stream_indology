No, it does not. (a) see discussion by Pingree and Gonzalez-Reimann on this
list.
(b) the astronomical system --if indeed of 1400 BCE / cf the Krttika
equinox of the 3rd mill.and your own note below--  can of course predate
the texts by a long shot.
We have been through this many times. Also on this list. Why always the
link between text and 'astronomical content'? The Satapatha case clearly
argues AGAINST such links.
When I write here "today the sun rose at 6:30 a.m." would that make me
pre-Copernican? Nope, since I wrote this sentence by computer... Old habits
of speech, calendars, rituals, etc. die slow.
