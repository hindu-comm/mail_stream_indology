I think what Chang Tsung-tung actually suggests is the takeover of the
early Chinese state by a numerically small group of techologically
advanced IE people -- rather like the Rus in the case of Russia or the
Normans for England.  To talk of a "conquest" or "invasion" might be
exaggerated -- but the idea sounds familiar.   He suggests that the
name Huang-ti (the Yellow Emperor) should be reconstructed as
something like hoang-deeg (= honey-[coloured] deva) -- those blonde
aryans again ?   Actually his material seems to establish a range of
fairly reliable cognates that need further investigation.

Chinese scholars now date the eaerliest proto-writing in China to
around 4000 BCE based on the pottery fragments found at Banpo near
Xian and elsewhere.   A trifle early for Harappa ?

Best wishes,
