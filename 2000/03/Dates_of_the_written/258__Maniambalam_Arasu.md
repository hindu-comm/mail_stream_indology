Dear Dr. Thompson,

I have seen Sakuntala Devi, the "human computer" in performance.
Also, long lines of ashtavadanis, shatavadanis, ...
Did the RV poets and the Aryans associated with them form separate
guilds/schools and taught the veda only to themselves?
Is the fidelity of the RV text thru oral transmission
because of this close-knit school network, small but widely spread
across India?

Arasu
