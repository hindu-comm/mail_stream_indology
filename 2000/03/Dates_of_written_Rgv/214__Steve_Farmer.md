I am fatigued after this long exchange, and my final post reads:

> As to the proposed links between the language of the Rgveda and Indian
> Valley civilizations argued for by Vishal Agurwal and others...

Language slips as fatigue slips in and neurotransmitters begin to
deplete. "Indus" in such cases may become "Indian." I imagine
that similar things happened to ancient reciters of the Veda,
with the drift sometimes becoming permanent after sufficient
repetitions.

Cheers,
