As many of our members are aware, John Smith's version of the
e-Mahabharata is available from the file server at

  http://bombay.oriental.cam.ac.uk

I would encourage anybody interested in the electronic version of the Mbh
to take a copy.  Anybody with the server space to provide a mirror of the
text could usefully do so.

All the best,
Dominik
