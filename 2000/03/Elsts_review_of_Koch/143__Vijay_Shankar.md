In his review of Kochhar's Vedic People, Elst has complimented the author
for mentioning data which on closer examination goes against the author's
own position. But in his long review Elst ignores points whch go against
his own position.Example: horse.
 Elst does not mention horse even though it adorns the cover page of
Kochhar's book.
Horse(asva in Skt, aspa in Avestan) is a fundamenta,basic,crucial part of
the Vedic and Avestan culture as well as of the Indo-Europeans in
general.India is not the natural habitat of the MODERN horse.There are no
wild horses in India .If India is the original home of the Aryans where did
they get horse from?Mr Erst would perhaps like to explain.
