Cattle may have been present but that's not the same as describing the
invading "Aryans" as cattle herders, which implies they were nomadic
cowboys.

In the same sense, chariots may have been present in the steppe, but the
nomadic people from that region have traditionally been mounted
warriors. Is there any evidence to suggest large chariot panzer
divisions in the steppe? For example, there is quite a bit of evidence
that war chariots were widely used in the Middle East and Northeastern
Africa.
