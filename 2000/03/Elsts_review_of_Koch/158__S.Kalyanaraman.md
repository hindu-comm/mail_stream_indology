For reference, the review is at the website:

This may also be of interest in the context of the ongoing River Sarasvati
problem. 

Dr. Dominik Wujastyk, beware! The Asian problem will always surface in
indology, whether one talks of a horse, a chariot, a river or even the
location of Ganga and Yamuna in Afghanistan... 

In other words, indology cannot stay immune from research-findings of other
"scholarly" disciplines...

Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
