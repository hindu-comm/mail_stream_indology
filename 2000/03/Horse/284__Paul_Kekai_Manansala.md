If the frequency or paucity of bones is not of value in the argument
than neither is the presence or absence of the horse in Harappan
artwork.

I should point out here that I do not believe that Harappa was Vedic.

However, there could be reasons that the horse was not depicted
artistically. Given the wide range of Harappan civilization, I doubt
that all varieties of fauna were depicted in their art. One possibility
is that representations of horses, if they existed, were -- for
religious reasons -- made solely of wood, in which case preservation
would be rare.
