I apologize to the other members of the list for trying to reach RZ in this way.

Robert, I have tried to answer your last mail, but my replies get rejected:
550 <zydenbos at gxm.li>... Host unknown (Name server: gxm.li: host not found)

Could you please check what is wrong?

Best regards,

Lars Martin
