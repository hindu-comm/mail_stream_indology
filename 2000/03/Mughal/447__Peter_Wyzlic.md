This would be a very large list. For Roman Catholic missionary activities
please refer to Robert Streit et al.: Bibliotheca Missionum (i.e. a
multi-volume bibliographical work, vol. 4 and 5 dealing with "Asiatic"
missions, vol. 6 with missionaries in India, one of the later volumes
gives additions if memory serves me right).

Besides Streit, there are some reference works (mostly on a broader scale
like Carlos Sommervogel on the Jesuits:  Bibliothèque de la Compagnie de
Jésus: bibliographie; histoire ... in many volumes). You know already
Stephen Neill's: A History of Christianity in India. 2 vols. Cambridge
1984-85? Or Edward McLagan: The Jesuits and the Great Mogul, publ. 1932?
