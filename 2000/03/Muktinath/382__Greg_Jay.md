Muktinath is one of the 108 Divya Deshas spoken of by the Sri Vaishnava
Alvars. I believe that it is mentioned in the verses of Nalayira Divya
Prabhandam attributed to Tirumangai Alvar. For more info on this please
contact Mani Varadrajan at mani at alum.calberkeley.org. There is also a
Sthala Purana of this place written on a column next to the Temple there. I
don't know the source of this. You may also find references in works
concerning Salagrama Sila (the ammonite deities of Visnu).
