I don't know if there is any relationship with this, I know
about a specific community in Maharashtra/Karnataka where
many parents/grandparents speak Kannada but the children generally
often speak Marathi.

I should mention here something regarding Rajputs. The Solanki
(Chaulukya) and Rathore (Rashtrakuta) clans originated in the south
with absolute certainty. Very likely the Parmars (who "originated"
at mount Abu) have something to do with Rashtrakutas. The Gahadavals
(V.P. Singh, the former PM, is one) are thought to have been related
to the Rashtrakutas in some way.

Is this "African genetic contribution" a speculation or there
is scientific basis for it? I assume this does not go back to
the time when humankind originated in Africa.

Can you mention the authors and the what they said? Thanks.
