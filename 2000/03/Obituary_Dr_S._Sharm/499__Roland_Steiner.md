The members of the Department of Indology, University of
Marburg, Germany, are extremely sorry to report the passing
away of Dr. Sarveswara Sharma Peri on March 17, 2000 (born
May 15, 1926). From 1964 until his retirement in 1991 he was a
"Lektor" in the department teaching Hindi, Telugu and Sanskrit.
Those who knew him will recall very well his recitation skill in
Sanskrit which he so readily and enjoyably displayed. In
everything he did the traditional Sanskrit training combined with
philological methodology in the tradition of his teacher Prof. Dr.
Wilhelm Rau (1922-1999) was also evident, especially for the
areas in which he has come to be a renowned specialist:
Sanskrit grammar, particularly Bhart.rhari, and Indian astrology.
He was himself even a poet having recently published his
autobiographical poem Madv.rttaanta.h - katham atha ca me
jarmaniide"savaasa.h in the difficult Mandaakraantaa metre
which he so much liked. His death comes after a long struggle
with heart problems.
The department will always remember him as a congenial and
pleasant teacher and colleague.
