Dear Ms. Filliozat and Mr. Palaniappan,

Thank you very much for your prompt and helpful replies.

I found the legend in R. Dessigane, P.Z. Pattabiramin and J. Filliozat, La
Legende des Jeux de ,Civa `a Madurai, d'apr`es les textes et les peintures,
[Publication de l'Institut Fran,cais d'Indologie, No 19], Pondichery, 1960,
Fasc. I, Texte, p. 88-91.  That is the 57th story of the series.

By the way, the text says that MiiNaa.t.cii was not sleeping, but only was
embarrassed and indifferent at the teaching of Veda by her husband...

It is really a very interesting myth.

Thank you again!

Best regards,

Nobumi Iyanaga
