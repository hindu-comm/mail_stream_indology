In reference to a sort of tantric muse/partner, two
popular scholars (Eliade and Walker) from the 50�s and
60�s translated the Sanskrit word d.ombii as
�washerwoman.� But I see no connection to �washer�
here. Are we to presume that they mistook d.ombii for
a female dhobi* or �laundry person�? Could the
apparent confusion be caused by mistaking the
retroflex d in d.ombii for a unretroflex dh as in
dhobi?

*Dhobi: presumably from Sanskrit root dhav, as is the
Hindi word dhona, both of which mean, �to wash�?

Kindly,

Troy Harris
