I agree. Prehistory is not usually determined by philological study
of texts written down thousands of years after the proposed events.

Archaeology, anthropology, genetics, etc., are the 'harder' approaches
that must be used in analyzing the past.

Free interpretation of Vedic hymns, dating of language, etc. is very
soft, mushy stuff.
