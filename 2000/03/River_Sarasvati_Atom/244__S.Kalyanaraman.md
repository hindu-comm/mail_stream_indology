Prof. Witzel, can you please name the five? Your number does not match with
the monumental Gazetteer of Sites of the Indus Age (2600 sites listed in
Appendix A of Possehl, 2000, Indus Age--The Beginnings, Delhi, Oxford and
IBH); of these 2600, about 80% are in the Sarasvati River Basin. Also, only a
few sites are found located on the river bed of Hakra in Cholistan, many are
on the river banks. Also, views on Dr. Kocchar's arguments locating Ganga and
Yamuna in Afghanistan (p.131 of his book)?

Regards, Dr. S. Kalyanaraman
