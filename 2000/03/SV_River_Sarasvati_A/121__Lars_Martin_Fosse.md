Those of you who like to compare similar words in various languages might have
fun reading the following piece (the reference is from the Indo-European list):

   "An easy accessible attempt on this topic is Mark Rosenfelder 'How likely
   are chance resemblances between languages? in
http://www.zompist.com/chance.html.
   Though in the binomial formulas one faculty mark '!' is always set wrong*,
   the results are correct. (*what shows that in one year nobody with minimal
   mathematical competence really did read this article). [Signed HJH(olm), a
competent
   mathematician and Indo-Europeanist]

Enjoy!
