Blaming the British for communal conflict is a trend that can be observed among
some scholars in the West as well, particularly political scientists and
historians dealing with the modern world (say after 1850). I have never quite
understood why, possibly because to these people everything before 1850 belongs
to deep geological time :-). But there are exceptions, such as the German
historian Klimkeit who follows the conflict and the roots of Hindu nationalism
back to Shivaji. If anything, I believe the British contributed to giving
communal conflict a modern form, and certainly to exacerbating it. But I don't
buy the idea that they "invented" it.

Best regards,
