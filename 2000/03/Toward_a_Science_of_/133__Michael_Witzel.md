I may draw your attention to the Volume we published a few years ago:

Translating, Translations, Translators From India to the West,
ed. by E. Garzilli (Harvard Oriental Series, Opera Minora, 1)
Cambridge 1996  (available from South Asia Books, Columbia, MO)

see:

what about your text above? is "science and the
practice of translating.."  inside or outside ? Or is it just politics? Or

Just kidding. But:
The last mono-causal or megalo-maniac interpretation of reality of the past
century. I am (not very eagerly) waiting for the first one of this new
century/millennium.

See above. Very hands-on volume, next to some theory.

Hope this helps!
