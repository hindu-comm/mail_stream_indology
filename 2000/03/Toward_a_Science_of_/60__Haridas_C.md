Dear List,

wondering about the variety of the past authors which
have been foundational to the science and the practice
of translating sanskrit, pali, and prakrit literature
in the west.

Any thoughts upon recent thinkers, such as Foucault,
Derrida, Godamer in light of the mechanics of
translating would be warmly welcomed also.

thank you.
