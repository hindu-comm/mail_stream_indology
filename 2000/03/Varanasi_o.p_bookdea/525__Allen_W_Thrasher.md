Could anyone who has recently had dealings with Bhagwan Das and Sons,
Asbhairav, Varanasi please contact me off the list?  I want to discuss
his out of print holdings.

Also, could anyone suggest any other dealers in Varanasi in out of
print and antiquarian books?  It has been about a decade since I
visited there.

Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
