Dear Mr. Pauranik,
in German we say "zwei Fliegen mit einer Klappe schlagen", (to kill to flies
with one slap). About the origin of this I am not sure, but there is a
Brothers Grimm folk tale about a tailor who hits seven flies with one slap (and
after that considers himself a hero).
Not much help, but maybe interesting - Regards Ursula Graefe
