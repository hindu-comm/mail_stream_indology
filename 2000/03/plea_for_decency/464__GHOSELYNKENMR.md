Dear Indology Members:

I would like to also put in my vote for a little more respect and
decency on the list. Chris Wallis' message was obviously a sincere
one, as was Robert Langston's.

I recently posted a question concerning Bhartr.hari, and, while it
was answered satisfactorily, it was also answered with a kind of
"put down" at the beginning. This little quip was very unnecessary.
In fact, these quips tend to obfuscate each point made rather than
clarify them.
