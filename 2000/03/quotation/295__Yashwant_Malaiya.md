I was told by someone (author of A historical study of the Brahmin
community) that it is the second line of

hastinaa taaDyamaanopi na gachchhejjainamandiram

yaavaniim is obviously Farsi. He did not know who
composed this shloka, but he thought that he must not have
been anyone significant.

Does anyone know the source of this line:

Thanks for any suggestions.
