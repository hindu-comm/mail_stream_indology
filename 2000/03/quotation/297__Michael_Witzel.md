Madhav, not this one,
and not even from personal practice, I am afraid, though it refers to us
Yavanas.

But a somewhat similar description of Greek in Syamilaka's Padataditaka
(Kashmiri author , c. 500 CE) , about the Greek woman whose speech no one
likes... Among others, too many -s- sounds. Must check the exact wording.
Ed. by G. Schokker c. 1960, The Hague.
