According to K.Subharhmanyam, in his trans and commentary to BrahmakANDa of
BhartRharis VAkyapadIyam,

the Veda is described as anAdi, without beginning.

Are anybody able to give me some references to texts. I am particulary
interested if this notion is found in the writings of Abhinavagupta, but
any referance would do.

Jon.
