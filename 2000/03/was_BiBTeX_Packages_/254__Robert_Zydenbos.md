Have you used the WordPerfect version 5 to LaTeX conversion program that was
written at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven several years ago? The
source code in Pascal is freely available, and I've used it on a few texts
that I had written. Probably you're aware of the program's existence, but I
thought I should mention it, just in case.
