F.B.J. Kuiper in "Proto-Munda Words in Sanskrit" suggests that .dombi
is Munda in origin, also linking its presumed root (connceted with
drumming) with .damara and .damaru.

I have previously written mentioning my belief that ".daakinii" in its
".daa`nkinii" form is also derived from the same root.  In Buddhist
tantras, the women who are identified as .daakiniis are especially
linked with the .Dombis and Shavaras -- Munda peoples mainly living in
parts of Orissa, Bihar and parts of Bengal -- thus giving
corroboration to the view that many Buddhist tantras originated in
those areas rather than N.W. India.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
