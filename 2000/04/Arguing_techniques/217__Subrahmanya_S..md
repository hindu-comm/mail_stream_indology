I do share Dr.Witzel's grave concern in this matter.

While this forum is merely a mailing list. The techniques
that Dr.Witzel mentions are found in some of the scholarly
books as well.
The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia volume edited by
Erdosy is one such example.

Also, Most members of this list will remember that a short time ago
one well known list participant started making immature comments
about stupid Belgians !!

The irony is that these same persons after having indulged
in viciousness - even in books - now claim victimhood :)

(As per Dr.Wujastyk's suggestion I have added emoticons :) )

Regards,
Subrahmanya
