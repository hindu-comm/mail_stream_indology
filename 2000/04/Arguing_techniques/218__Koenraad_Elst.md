My apologies to both list members mentioned, for there is a misunderstanding
here.  In a Dutch aside in a mail mostly addressed to me, Prof. Witzel
jocularly said he would not start telling Belgian jokes.  From my reply that
I don't care too much about Belgian jokes thrown at me, some have inferred
that Witzel did try the Belgian joke strategy.  He did not, and I found the
exchange rather humorous.  No need to get worked up about this.

Cheers,

K. Elst
