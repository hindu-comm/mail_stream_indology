This is some kind of accusation of cronyism.  I don't like it.  It isn't
true.  And I am cancelling your subscription to this list for making
unsubstantiated and unpleasant accusations against me.

I've really tried hard on several occasions to help you to abide by the
conventions of this list.  It hasn't worked.
