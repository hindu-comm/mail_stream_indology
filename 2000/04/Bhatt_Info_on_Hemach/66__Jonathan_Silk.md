>Although I am not Prof. Witzel :-) I can suggest John Brough: The
>Gaandhaarii Dharmapada. London, Oxford University Press, 1962. There is a
>good section (over 50 pages) on Gandhari language. In the Bibliography he
>also lists some more books and articles dealing with Gandhari.

Although I am also not [yet? ;-)  ] Prof Witzel, or Prof Rozehnal, I
may suggest one, for great profit and pleasure, take a look at
Richard Salomon, Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from Gandhara (Seattle,
1999), for the most up-to-date materials, with copious references for
other work.
