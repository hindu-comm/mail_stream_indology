It's not terminological difference of opinion that's
really at issue here. I'm afraid the spirit of Dr
Palaniappan's original post is getting lost here in
some very fine philological hair splitting :-)

To my mind, Dr Palaniappan was suggesting that Tamil
was a Classical language on par with Sanskrit. To
quote the original post,

Indeed, as AK Ramanujan once wrote, "Tamil, one of two
classical languages of India, is the only language of
contemporary India which is recognizably continuous
with a classical past."

Perhaps it is this recognizable continuity with its
Classical past which makes some people, sometimes even
professionals not particularly familiar with Tamil
literature, to say that Tamil is not a Classical
language.

I wonder if even they would call it a Prakrit.

Thanks and Warm Regards,
