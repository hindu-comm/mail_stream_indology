Dear list members, I am forwarding a question from a student in Anthropology
in NYU. I would enourmously appreciate your help. Gabriela Nik. Ilieva

>Question:  Are there any references to eunuchs and/or hijras in Ramayana
>and/or Mahabharata?  In Zia Jaffrey's "The Invisibles," she quotes a
>hijra saying that when Ram, Sita and Lakshman were leaving Ayodhya, the
>townspeople follwed them.  Rama said, "Men and women, go back to your
>homes." But since the hijras are neither man nor woman, they did not know
>what to do.  As a result, when Rama returned fourteen years later, he
>found the hijras where he had left them.  Pleased with their devotion, he
>blessed them and granted them the right to exist (p. 29).  If there is
>such a story, which version is it in and what books?  Thank you for your
help.
