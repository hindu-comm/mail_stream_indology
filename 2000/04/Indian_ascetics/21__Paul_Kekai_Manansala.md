How old and widespread is the monastic tradition with regard to
ascetics. Isn't the tradition of mendicants, forest hermits, etc. much
older?  Note the story of the Buddha as an ascetic.

Pot smoking is also an old tradition, at least among some Saiva sadhus.
In Nepal, I had heard, but never confirmed, that sadhus around temples
like Pasupatinath have dispensation from Nepal's otherwise strict laws
regarding pot.
