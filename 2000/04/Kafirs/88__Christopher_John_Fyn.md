I recall reading somewhere that there are still a few Buddhists amongst the
Shina
population of Pakistan who live in Gilgit and neighbouring areas. I don't know

they are supposed to be the remaining followers of a native Buddhist tradition
or a people that were at some time converted by Tibetan / Ladakhi Buddhist
missionary activity.
