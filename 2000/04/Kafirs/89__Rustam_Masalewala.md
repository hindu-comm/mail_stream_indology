The article would seem to suggest that Buddhism can come
back.

I have heard that in Islamic rule, apostasy is unlawful,
punishable by death. Also no other religion may be publicly
preached in a way to compete with Islam. Thus once Islam
is dominant, there is no going back to any other religion.
Is that correct?

Is it legal for Muslims to become Buddhist in Pakistan?
