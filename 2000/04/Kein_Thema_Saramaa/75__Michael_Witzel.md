Dealt with, I believe in some detail,  by K.Hoffmann long ago, see his
Aufsaetze zur Indoiranistik. Wiesbaden 1985-6/1991

as for tava+ USuSO  = gen. perfect participle  of vas "you that has
dwelt/stayed overnight "

bhUmi-kapaThu is a particular kind of (white?) mushroom, in case derived
from the milk products vomited by the bitch Saramaa.

grAmasya jaghanArdhe means at the "back end of the settlement/trek'

Even Brahmana time Indo-Aryans were still on the move, as W. Rau has shown
(see his paper in:  Inside the texts, Harvard Oriental ser. Opera Minora
vol. 2, on graama).
A moving wagon train has a jaghana... with refuse left behind obviously.
Otherwise, "in the back, i.e. western side", as once in JB where Indra
threw the horse head to the 'backside'/ western side of Kuruksetra (east =
front).

Hope that helps...MW.
