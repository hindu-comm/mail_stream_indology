Interested in Candragomin's drama called Lokaananda.
Now extant only in Tibetan traslation. Ma.nicuu.da
feeds the monster with his own limbs and flesh.
This reminds of tales like Shibi's. Was Harshadeva's
Nagananda inspired by Lokananda? Since Harshadeva's
Naagaananda happens partly in Malaya mountains in the south,
does Lokananda or Ma.nicuu.daavadaana have any episode connected
with Malaya too?

Haven't seen Ratna's 1967 study. Any other references
on Lokananda, comparison between the two -aananda naa.takas
are appreciated.

Thanks,
SM
