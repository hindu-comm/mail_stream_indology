Thanks, Sir for your informative reply. A reference, a friend gave
me is: Ratna Hadurukande, Manicudavadana, being a translation and
edition, and Lokananda: a transliteration and synopsis. Luzac, 1967.

Pilgrimage to Malaya(Potiyil) is narrated in tamil epics,
Cilappatikaram and Manimekalai too. In the buddhist manimekalai,
the vidyaadhara couple, kAyacaNTikai and her lover go
to Potiyil. Interesting that Th. Watters and S. Beal's translation
of Hsuan Tsang's travelogue identifying Potalaka with the Malaya
mountains, and later Tibetan sources saying Candragomin
went to Potalaka to recover Sanskrit grammar. Also, Dr. Palaniappan's
article on the parvata in VP 2.486 and its relation to
potiyil, the center of Dakshinamurti cult.

The scanty pieces on Malaya in L. are intriguing, and did Harsha
in his Nagananda expand the incidents happening in Malaya
much further?

Kind regards,
SM
