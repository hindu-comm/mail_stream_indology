Dear Bijoy, don't worry.  I only unsubscribe people who are obviously rude
and vindictive to other members of this list.  Interestingly, every single
person whom I have unsubscribed this year has sent me a rude and insulting
email about it.  Funny, isn't it.

Anyhow, all anyone has to do to enjoy a long and happy membership of this
list is to be POLITE, and to stick to the topics for which this list was
designed.  That is all laid out in the "scope" and "rules" documents on
the INDOLOGY website.

Decisions are taken by me alone.
