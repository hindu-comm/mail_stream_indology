Friends,

can anyone suggest a good basic textbook (or chapter) for the topic
Hindusim/Buddhism in a one-term Philosophy of religion course? The course is
for students of philosophy; they can be bright, but typically fairly innocent
about anything Indian (or Eastern). The optimal length would be about 120
pages, but it could be O.K. between 50 and 300.

Thanks for any idea,

Ferenc
