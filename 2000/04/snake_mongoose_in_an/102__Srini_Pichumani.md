I would certainly think so...  of course,  I am extrapolating backwards from what I
have personally seen,  albeit very carefully in the confines of my living room ,
on a National Geographic program featuring the King Cobra in the southwest of
India.  The video captures the friendly encounters of Romulus Whitaker,  a renowned
herpetologist based in Madras,  with the said snake...  in one of the scenes,  a
mongoose is shown fearlessly snapping at the snake while prancing about... for its
part,  the snake raises its hood,  hisses a lot,  and assumes a very mean posture
in general.  No more gore !
