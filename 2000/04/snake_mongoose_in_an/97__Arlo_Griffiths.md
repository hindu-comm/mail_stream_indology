At the AOS meeting in Baltimore (1999), Joshua Katz gave a paper on "How the
Mole Got his Name" [which probably has been published by now somewhere; does
anyone have his email address?], in which he dealt primarily with the word
aakh;u-, but also with other animal names like kaa;siik;aa- and your
nakul;a-.
    Reading his handout, I see that he emphasizes that we are dealing indeed
with Mongooses, NOT ichneumons. As for mongooses in India, he says that "we
find a number of kinds of mongoose (the word mongoose [and other spellings;
cf. Germ. Mungo] is a borrowing from Dravidian), including two species in
the north: Herpestes edwardsi (Common or Indian Grey Mongoose) and Herpestes
auropunctatus (Golden or Small Indian Mongoose). Katz refers to:

- Encyclopedia of Indian natural History 97; R.F. Ewer, The Carnivores
(Ithaca, NY 1973), 402f.; Walker's Mammals of the World (II.), 1043f.

He further refers to "hari.n;a-" as a name for Mongoose, with ref. to SW
Jamison, "The Ravenous Hyenas and the Wounded Sun", 59-61 and 87f (with ref.
to MS 3.9.3 tasmaad dhari.nam svaja.m khaadati). He adds many more
interesting bits of information, which I won't quote anymore, as they have
probably appeared in print somewhere already.
    From Vedic literature (thus, excluding the at least one hundred passages
where the nakula- is mentioned in Mahaabhaarata and Raamaayana, as well as
interesting passages from Dharma texts, Kau.tilya and Vaagbha.t.ta), I find
in my database the following (selected) interesting passages:

I hope this helps. please check in the Mahaabhaarata yourself, because it
seems to be full of interesting passages.

> Dear list-members,
>
> I am looking for further information about how the relation between
> snakes and mongoose was conceived of by ancient Indian writers, as well
> as perhaps - though this is not strictly speaking "INDOLOGY-stuff" - the
> distribution of mongoose in (ancient) India.
> My starting-point is the famous list of seven inferential connections,
> attested for the ancient SAMkhya treatise "SaSTitantra", which features
> a "relation between killer and killed" (vadhyaghAtakabhAva), said to
> obtain between a snake and a mongoose. To the best of my knowledge, it
> is not specified in older sources what an inference based on such a
> relation might look like. Much later sources (VAcaspatimizra's
> NyAyavArttikatAtparyaTIkA or Udayana's KiraNAvalI) seem to assume that
> when a snake (ahi) emits a certain sound (visphUrjanazabda - a hissing
> sound?), one infers that a mongoose (nakula) is present in proximity. I
> would interpret this as indicating that this particular sound of a snake
> is caused by the presence of the mongoose as its enemy.
> It is obvious that snake and mongoose were thought of as mutual enemies,
> though the few available descriptions that provide more details on the
> consequences of their mutual hostility vary: In a passage in the
> NyAyavArttikatAtparyaTIkA, the snake (sarpa) is described as
> "victorious" (jaya) and the mongoose (nakula) as the one who is defeated
> (parAjaya); in a much earlier passage in DignAga's
> PramANasamuccayavRtti, the snake (*ahi) is described as defeated and the
> mongoose (*nakula) as victorious.
> From my little knowledge about mongoose, the latter strikes me as more
> plausible, since mongoose are known to attack and kill certain kinds of
> poisonous snakes, for instance cobras. I am wondering however whether
> the behaviour of the different subspecies of mongoose (herpestidae) that
> were, or are, at home on the Indian sub-continent varies significantly
> in this respect.
>
> Thus my questions:
> (1) Does anyone know of further passages in ancient Sanskrit literature
> - by which I don't mean exclusively philosophical literature - which
> shed more light on how the relation between snake and mongoose was
> understood?
> (2) Is anything known about the distribution of different kinds of
> mongoose on the Indian sub-continent, esp. significant changes during
> and since the first millenium C.E., and whether they differ at all
> regarding their behaviour towards snakes?
>
