Perhaps residents near mumbai can recall a large fresh water lake north of
bombay called vaitarana.

Maybe vihara lake also north of bombay is named after buddhist caves found
in rock cliffs near the lake. What about vaitarna. Are these mordern names
which came into fashion after the city of bombay was founded?
