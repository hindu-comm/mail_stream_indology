This thread is now closed.  Please do not post further on this topic. The
different points of view of the discussants are clear enough, and no
further important information is likely to be offered at this time.

The subject is - as usual - interesting, but it is not properly part of
the study of classical India, at least in the manner in which it has been
being discussed.

Best wishes to all,
