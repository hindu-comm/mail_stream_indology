In a 13th century Tamil Vaishnavite work, we come across the name "kaGkOrai"
as a place in Karnataka. This could stand for kaGkOrai, kaGkOrA, kaGgOrai,
kaGgOrAi, gaGkOrai, gaGKOrA, gaGgOrai, gaGgOrA, etc. I would like to locate
this place more accurately. I would appreciate any help from Karanataka
experts who can tell us the exact location of this place based on
inscriptional or textual sources in Kannada. Thanks in advance.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
