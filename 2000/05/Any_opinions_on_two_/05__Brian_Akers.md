Someone recently suggested consulting the Routledge Encyclopedia of
Philosophy. I visited the Routledge site and discovered the 10-volume set
costs almost $4,000.

I noted they have two other titles that look promising:

Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy
Concise Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy

Does anyone have an opinion on these books?
