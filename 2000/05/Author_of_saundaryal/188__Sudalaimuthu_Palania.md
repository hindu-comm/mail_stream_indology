Norman Brown states that the author of the SaundaryalaharI commentary,
sudhAvidyotinI, is variously given as arijit or aricchit. If anybody has
worked with that commentary, I would appreciate, if they could provide the
exact translation of the biographical details of the author as found in the
text. I am particularly interested in the version with the name 'aricchit'.
Thanks in advance.

Regards
S. Palaniappan
