Dear Mr Rajesh Kocher,

Hope you must have already rcvd copy of my e-mail to Mr Kharbanda regarding
Vedic Maths & Mr Kharbanda also mentioned about your interest in the subject
esp. Vedic. I'd strongly urge upon you to consider possibilities of
organising Vedic Maths Workshops in NISTADS & let me know your feedback.
Looking forward to hear from you.
