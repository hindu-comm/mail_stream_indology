There is an annotated bibliography of over 500 papers at:
http://www.mum.edu/tm_research/tm_biblio/welcome.html

Many of the above papers have charts summarizing findings. The charts are
given at:
http://www.mum.edu/tm_research/tm_charts/welcome.html

The conclusion of these papers is very strongly that
1) It DOES make difference WHAT you do.
2) It does make a difference HOW you do it.

There is also extensive research in progress relating specific recitations
of Vedas and Vedic literature to almost every aspect of human health.

The US government, National Institute of Health, is funding a major research
center for alternative medicine base on this research.

relief from various conditions) at the site of "Vedic Vibrations":
