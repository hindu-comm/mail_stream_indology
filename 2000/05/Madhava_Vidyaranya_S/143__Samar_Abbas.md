Being `kindred outsiders', the ruling caste welcomed the Muslim invaders
as it enabled them to perpetrate their rule over the Sudra masses :

As stated by the author, Dr. Jamanadas,
 "The Muslim Rule was also a Brahmanic rule s far as the masses were
  concerned."

Aryan, Brahman, Turk or Saka. And the outsiders appear to have helped one
another, fearful of an indigenous uprising.

The medieval Sanskrit term Turuska is a hangover from the days of Kushan
and Tokharian invasions. The Aryans confounded the later Muslim Turks
with the previous Buddhist Turks. The preceding Buddhist and Zoroastrian
`Turuskas' (ie. Rajputs) actively participated in the army of the Islamic
Turkic sultanate, forming more than half of Aurangzeb's army. The army was
thus a `Turuska' army for the medieval writers.
