  Halebid/Dvarasamudra was captured by Malik Kafur in 1310
  aided by an Yadava king. Hoysala king, Ballala III, returned
  from a war with Pandyas and accepted M. Kafur's terms. Later
  Madurai too succumbed to MK. Vidyaranya saw all this,
  and probably did not want to set his presence in the
  political capitals of the day.

  Regards,

  Prasad
