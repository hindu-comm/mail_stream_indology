dear LISTeners,

as far as i know, theyÂ´re working on a bengali-plugin for finereader 
5 (soon availiable).
maybe they will reply on email, found them interested in discussing 
new features.
Omnipage is definitely not the ocr for nonroman scripts.

greetings jan seifert

btw: finereader 5.x will be avail. for macintosh too.
