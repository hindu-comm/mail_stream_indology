Could anybody shed a little light on the Shavara
(diacriticals unknown)? Does the term relate to corpse
(=zava). Stephen Hodge mentioned the term in an email
to the Indologist List dated 22 April 2000, �.dombi as
scavenger woman�

Regarding this he wrote, ��(The women identified as
.daakiniis are especially linked with the .Dombi and
Shavara, i.e., Munda peoples living mainly in parts of
Orissa, Bihar and Bengal.)�
