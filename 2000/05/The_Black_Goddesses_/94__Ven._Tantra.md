I request again the kind assistance of List members to
help me to identify 3 Indian Goddesses. I am assuming
the icons are all of the Kaalii/Durgaa type, but I am
trying to determine their specific identities.

The images themselves are quite remarkable
(non-erotic):
1) line drawing
2) print
3) painting

Best regards,

Ven. Tantra
