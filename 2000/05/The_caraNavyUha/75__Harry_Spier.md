Dear list members,

In A.B. Keiths introduction to his translation of the taittirIya saMhitA he
mentions a text the "caraNavyUha".

i.e.
1) "That saMhitA [the taittirIya] must have gone back at least to the
khANDikIyas, of which the Apastambas are a subdivision in the
caraNavyUha,..."

2) "Buhler asserts that the caraNavyUha attributes to the khANDikIyas one
and the same text, but this statement with its details which show that our
saMhitA [the taittirIya] is ment is not contained in Weber's edition of the
text."

Can anyone give me any information about what this text, the caraNavyUha is?

Many thanks,
