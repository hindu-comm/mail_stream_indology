Friends;

i am curious about the methodology of finding a guru in classical hinduism...How does one look?  when does one know he/she has found their guru?  how does one approach this guru? is this discussed in the Dharmasuutraas?  I ask only for my own purposes...not scholarly, those of seeking out a guru. any help you can provide will be of immense help and quite appreciated

namaste

steve

" The Spirit of God, I realized, is exaustless Bliss; His body is countless tissues of light..."

-Paramahansa Yogananda

Lord Buddha was once asked why a man should love all persons equally.
"Because," the great teacher replied, "in the very numerous and varied lifespans of
each man, every other being has at one time or another been dear to him."
