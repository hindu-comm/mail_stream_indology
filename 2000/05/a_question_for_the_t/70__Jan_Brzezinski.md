It seems to me that in 99% of cases, it was an
inherited family affair -- kula-gurus, following
pretty much the same procedure as yajamanas.

For those whose calling was more pronounced, you have
your work cut out for you. You will probably find that
there are repeated archetypal patterns involving the
usual suspects: long fruitless searches followed by
dream revelations, sudden apparitions, tests of
sincerity, and so on.

You have tons of hagiographical material to plough
through, so good luck.

Jan
