Greetings-

I am trying to locate copies of texts in the "Buddhist Sanskrit Texts"
series from the Mithila Institute, Darbhanga that was done in the late 50's
early 60's. The main editor was P L Vaidya. There are a couple of them
listed on bibliofind and abebooks, but I was wondering if anyone knows if
there are any other sources? Also is there a complete list of volumes in
this series anywhere?

Thank you

Dante Rosati
