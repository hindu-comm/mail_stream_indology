Dear list members,

I've been asked to try to identify the following book.  The information I've
been given is as follows.  It is a volume of a large series of unabridged
Virashaivite texts published by the University of Karnataka which contains a
long debate between Basavanna, Akkamahadevi and Allama Prabhu, and is in
english.  Do any of the list members recognize this description and if any
of the publishers who are members of the list can supply it then please let
me know.

Many thanks,



Harry Spier
