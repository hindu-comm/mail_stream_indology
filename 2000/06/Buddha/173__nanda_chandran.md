The reference to the Buddha in the GaudapAdiya KArikA is a highly
controversial topic. It is asserted by traditionalists that "Buddha" refers
to Lord NArAyana or a "wise one".

Though the word "Buddha" does mean "awakened" or "wise one" and it might
have been used in pre Buddhist literature, can the learned members confirm
whether this trend was followed i.e, the use of the word "Buddha", by non
Buddhist schools after the advent of the historical Buddha.

So was it after the historical Buddha only Buddhist schools used the term
and after him the other schools ceased to use the term to indicate their
wise ones?
