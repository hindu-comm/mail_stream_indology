Subject: Upgrade to CSX+ and CARB fonts for PC

I have released new PC versions of the CSX+ and CARB fonts. Only the
TrueType fonts have been changed, and there should be no visible
difference between the old versions and the new ones. The upgrade
was necessary because some software was failing to "see" all the
fonts in each family; I have improved the information that the fonts
make available to programs that use them, and the problem appears to
be solved. The fonts can be found at
