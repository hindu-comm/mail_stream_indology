I've spent the day with this volume, George. The whole of it, which is
just hitting the libraries, is essential reading. The redefinitions in
the volume of what is *meant* by "bronze" and "iron" ages, etc., are
surprising and far-reaching. The volume underlines the difficulties in
India of dating questions involving iron technology, due to complex
regional issues that are just starting to be understood. The article
in the volume by Bennet Bronson on the introduction of iron in China,
based in part on Don Wagner's 1993 work, should be read in conjunction
with Wagner's newly revised views, already pointed to at
http://staff.hum.ku.dk/dbwagner/EARFE/EARFE.html. Below, I give the
table of contents of the volume in jpeg format.
