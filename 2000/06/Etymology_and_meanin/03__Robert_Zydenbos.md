'Bhaava' has also been imported into Kannada and is a word that is
often used to translate English 'emotion' (also the loanword 'bhaavane'
is used in a similar sense). From this is also derived the Kannada
verb 'bhaavisu-' meaning "to feel, to experience emotionally".

I have never come across a usage of any of these words with a meaning
such as "price" or "market rate" in Kannada.
