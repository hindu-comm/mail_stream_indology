I am just curious. Was the vedic sacrificial altar created first by digging a
pit and then building a fire inside so that the fire could be below ground
level and thought of as fire pit? Was it ever built  from ground level up
with enclosing materials (bricks?) to contain the fire?  Among these two,
which was more prevalent? Thanks in advance.
