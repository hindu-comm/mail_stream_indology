And while on the subject, it is said that the Vedi was
narrow in the middle, resulting in the use of
vedi-madhyamA to denote a thin-waisted woman. Can
anyone explain what an altar that is narrow in the
middle looks like?

I have seen numerous fire sacrifices, but never yet
anything that reminded me of a thin-waisted woman.
