Dear List Members,

I am looking for some simple information on the notion of satyavacana in
classical Indian thought in general and if possible in Buddhist thought,
literature, etc.

Thank you very much in advance for any thoughts, bibliographical data or
references.

Best regards,

Nobumi Iyanaga
Tokyo,
Japan
