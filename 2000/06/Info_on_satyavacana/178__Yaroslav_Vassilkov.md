There are many works and remarks on the subject. What comes to mind first is:
        Penzer M.M. (ed.) The Ocean of Story, being C.H.Tawney's translation of
Somadeva's KathA Sarit SAgara, London, 1924-28, vol.2, pp.30-33, vol.3, pp.179-182;
W.Norman Brown. Duty as Truth in the Rig Veda. - India Maior. Congratulatory Volume
presented to Prof.J.Gonda. Leiden, 1972, pp.57-67.
        Best regards
                                                Ya.V.
