Dr. Nash of Bristol University is trying to establish the language, and if possible meaning of some inscriptions he has found in Java.

I attach a very reduced scan of a photo of one of them. If anyone thinks he/she may be able to help, I would suggest they get in touch with Dr. George Nash direct - at

georgejayne at lineone.net

I am sure someone among such a learned assembly will be able to at least give a clue!
