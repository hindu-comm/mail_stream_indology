In reply to Chris Beetle:

This is not a confessional list devoted to Vaishnava apologetics. My
request was for information (facts) concerning the doctrines of two
medieval schools of Hindu thought, namely those of Vallabha and Nimbarka
(not Caitanya). The question of Bhagavata exegesis came up only because
another poster referred to that text, seemingly implying that it espouses a
Krishnaite (as opposed to Vishnuite) theology, which it does not. It is
ridiculous to state that I have 'attacked the Gaudiya tradition'. This is
not a place for such attacks, nor for repudiations; nor is it acceptable in
a scholarly forum to assume that the correct understanding of a religious
text (such as the Bhagavata) rests only with the commentator/s of one
particular sect.

I will not respond further to this type of argument.

Regards,
Martin Gansten
