Dear Vidyasankar,

Thank you very much for these references. This is precisely the sort of
thing I was looking for. I particularly appreciate your point regarding
Vallabha's rejection of bhagavad-antaryaami-bheda.

Right. This seems to be the general stance not only of Advaita, but of the
'greater tradition' overall, including southern Vaishnavism and the
puranas/agamas/etc. (The Brahmavaivarta passage that you mention is an
interesting exception; would you know the exact reference?)

Regards,
Martin Gansten
