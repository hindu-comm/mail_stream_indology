I would look at Vallabha's comm. on the Bhagavata P., I.3-28.  This verse
is cited as an authority in this matter by the Gaudiyas, and it is clear
that they were not the first to do so; that same interpretation of the
verse is discarded by Madhva in his commentary on it, and also in his
commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, X-41.

Although *in recent times* it is the Gaudiyas who are most prominent
supporters of this theory, it is certainly older than the earliest
available exposition of it.  Perhaps Chitsukha, Punyaranya, or some other
pre-Madhva commentator on the Bhagavata expounded it also.
