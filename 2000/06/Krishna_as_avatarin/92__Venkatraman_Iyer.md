Dear Prof. Gansten,

Since the Bhagavatha p. was written in the Tamil south, a look
into the Alvars' poetry will prove fruitful. Often times,
it is hard to distinguish between Krishna and Vishnu in
the classical Sangam corpus which predate Alvars by several
centuries. In classical tamil lit., Vishnu is called
"Maal"(= the black one).

Regards,
V. Iyer
