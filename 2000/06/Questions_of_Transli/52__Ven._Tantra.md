Could you kindly indulge my very rudimentary question?
I am getting mixed signals from �reputable sources�
concerning the correct transliteration of certain
Sanskrit words. This concerns the use of the Sanskrit
�n� and/or �m� and the proper placement of the under
and over dot. The terms in point are:

1) sannyas / sa.nnyaas ? -- (i.e., �renunciate�)

2) sa.nkhya / sa.mkhya ? -- (re. the philosophical
school).

With thanks.

Ven Tantra
