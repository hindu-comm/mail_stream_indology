Devanagari script has four sounds; t  dot,th dot: t,th.If you wish to write
Indian words without using diacritics, you must do with only two Roman
combinations: t and th.Hindi does away with distiction between  t and t
dot.,e,g, t serves different purposes in tota (parrot) and chattan
(rock).Similarly th and th dot are seved by th...South indian languages ,on
the other hand, distinguish between t and t dot by using t and th
respectively. They do not need sybols for th as in thali, and so on.

Subject: h after t and d in S. Indian transliterations


>I notice that South Indian publications when using Anglicisations or
>informal Romanizations of Sanskrit terms often add h after d dental
>and possibly t dental.  Why is this?  Could it be that since English t
>and d are alveolar rather than really dental and so are in between
>Indic dentals and retroflexes, the h brings the tongue forward against
>the teeth and so to the Dravidian speaker represents a dental better,
>whereas an English dental would sound closer to a retroflex?
