No, it doesn't.  What is your source?  The highest span of life given, not
by tradition but by scholars in the last century or so, is 94 years, and
this has been solidly disputed by B.N.K. Sharma in the "History of the
Dvaita School of Vedanta and Its Literature."  Tradition consistently
holds 79 years to be the span.

Regards,

Shrisha Rao
