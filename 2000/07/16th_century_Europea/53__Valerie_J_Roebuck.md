Dear list members

Does anyone know what Hindu religious and philosophical ideas would have
been accessible in Europe by about 1585?  For example what were the 'works
of Veaso (Vyaasa)', and other Hindu 'doctors and masters' translated for
the Jesuits and brought to Rome c. 1559 (D. Ferroli, 'The Jesuits in
Malabar', Bangalore, 1939, Volume 2, page 402)?  And what did the
Franciscans and Dominicans (active in S. India from the early 1500s) send
back to Europe?

Thanks for any information--
