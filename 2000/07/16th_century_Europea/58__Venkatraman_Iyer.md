SF>Angelo Poliziano ("father of philology" to Renaissance scholars,
SF>who never heard of Saakalya, Yaaska, Panini, or Patanjali, etc.)
SF> ...

There is another ancient philologist from a different part of
India whom the Renaissance sholars might not have heard of.
TolkAppiyar (note that the "o" here is the short Dravidian vowel,
not present in Sanskrit; The long o by used in this name
gives totally unexpected meanings) whose teacher hailed from
ataGkOTu, not too from Calicut.
