Dear list members,

If any of the members have these books (which I can't find on either the new
or used internet book finder services)and would consider selling them then
please contact me off the list.

1) An Avesta Grammar in Comparison with the Sanskrit, by A.V. Jackson.

2) The english translation of The Indo-Aryan Languages from the Vedas to
Modern Times by Jules Bloch.

Many thanks,
