>You misconstrue the meaning of "opposite" in Shrisha's post.

Maybe I did, but my argument was directed more towards the general
difficulties in proving by logic the existence or non-existence of a creator
God (which I think all the VedAntins had caught on to) and not the specifics
of the Dvaitin's dialectic against the NaiyAyika.

>â€‰From the start I've never asserted the Udhayana is earlier than Shankara. I
was just curious as to how the NaiyAyikas could pursue the argument even
after Shankara. Apparently they did. And the references provided by Shrisha
and Elliot show the necessary proof.

Thanks for all the constructive responses to my queries.
