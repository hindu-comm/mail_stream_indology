svataH pramANa has a flip side to it - parataH apramANa. As
I said, I was being brief, so I had to bring it down to the
rudimentary details.

How do you validate knowledge itself, without getting into
the nature of proof?

I can only say, read the nyAya sUtras, bhAshya and vArttika.
Specifically, sUtras 2. 1. 58-69, 2. 2. 13-21, and the comments
by vAtsyAyana and uddyotakara (note the spelling) thereon.

Aiyo, Rama! Is it too much to expect that one who wishes to
discuss these things should first read about them? The nyAya
and vaiSeshika views of ad.r.s.ta are quite different. And
within nyAya itself, you find changes in its meaning over time.

Has anybody said that advaita ontology is the same as nyAya
ontology? Or should we insist that unless two schools of
thought share a similar ontology, there is no influence of
one on the other?
