I have been having a rather heated discussion with somebody about the
use and origins of the term "dhyani Buddha".  I have never come across
it in any canonical Buddist texts but I believe it was a C19th
European invention which should be discarded.  Any comments and views
about the appropriateness of the term would be welcome.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
