And, vartate 'is, exists' is only post-Vedic. Later by at least 1000
 years than the Rgveda. .... etc

But doesn't RR claim that the bulk of harappan writings are post vedic. Oh
well maybe I will have another look and make sure.
Anyway as far as vowels, consonants not counting, we just have to look at
english, ( sumerian also ?).

I admit that readings of this sort are hard to prove or disprove but its as
bad/good an attempt as any other to date.
