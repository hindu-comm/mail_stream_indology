Dear members of the list,

the following question turned up on a Norwegian list for South-Asianists (Nofsa).

>I am currently writing up my MA thesis in social anthropology, based on a
>fieldwork I did last year in Tihar Jail, New Delhi, on human rights
>education of subordinate prison staff. I am trying to locate some references
>on South Asian concepts of punishment and justice. Do you have any ideas?

Can anybody help? I will send the answers to the relevant person.

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
