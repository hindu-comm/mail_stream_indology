bad joke- So I am tempted to respond.

I quote-

hoDase nAbhijAteSu klIvase nAbhimAnisu /
vidagdhasi na mugdheSu nApragalbheSu galbhase //

"BTW, the "dha" in Udhayana is more pronounced and thicker than it is in
Nanda, thus justifying the "h" in the former."

insufficient knowledge of zikSA. 

I parody-

kaSTaM vyAkaraNaM nUnaM zikSA kaSTatarA tataH /
ko daH ko vA dha iti alprANaH mUDhAyate //

Best.
