   According to Ravindra Singh Bhist(leader of the excavation team at
Dholavira for the Archaeological Survey of India), this ancient city was
planned on three levels:(1) a citadel,(2) a fortified middle town with
spacious residences, and (3) a lower town with densely packed houses. Bhist
has called these three levels parama, madhyama, and avama after the Rigvedic
parameshthina, madhyameshthina, and avameshthina (see the article "Looking
Beyond Indus Valley" by Vijaya Pushkarna in The Week July 26, 1998, pp
12-18). Can someone on the list point out where exactly these terms appear
in the Rigveda. Thanks,
   Shrinivas Tilak
