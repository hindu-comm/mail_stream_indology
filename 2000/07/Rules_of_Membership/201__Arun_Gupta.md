The poor soul from Trivandrum who has been banished from this list for a
long article, could have avoided banishment easily if he could put up his
article on a web-site, and then published a URL on Indology. ( This method
is recommended in the rules of this list. )

So, either he was careless, or a web-site was not accessible to him.  I tend
to suspect the latter.  Perhaps some reader of this list has a web-site and
would be willing to accept such submissions.
