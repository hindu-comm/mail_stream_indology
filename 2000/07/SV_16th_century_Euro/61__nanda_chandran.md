Isn't there a reference in one of Plato's works, of a meeting between
Socrates and an Indian gymnosophist? If I remember right, the Indian
gymnosophist is said to have mocked at the Greek philosopher's definition of
philosophy, saying the science had no meaning if it didn't relate to the
divine.

I also remember reading somewhere that the gymnosophist referred to by Plato
was most probably a JainA ascetic.
