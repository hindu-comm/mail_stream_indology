I read her earlier book on the non-Aryans in the RV, "Civilized Demons".
Her thesis is that IVC people are related to the Parsis, Zorastrians,
Assyrians ("Asuras", acc. to Malti). Is her second book, The Language,
extending her PhD/I book backwards chronologically? But recent excavations
at Mehrgarh (Jarrige), and several digs by Kenoyer team, etc., have
thrown out the "diffusionary model" for the IVC, or still Malti's
Assyrian-IVC hypothesis possible?

Thanks,
SM
