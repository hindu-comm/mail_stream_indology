Hello,

I am an American Buddhist monk finishing my Doctorate at the Graduate
Theological Union in Berkeley, California. My topic is bowing in
Chinese Buddhist repentance liturgies. I need any information on
Indian sources that discuss bowing.  I would like some help in
locating both Hindu and Indian Buddhist texts that discuss bowing and
making prostrations as part of religious practice.

Sanskrit and Pali sources would be useful, and also translations of
texts into Tibetan and European languages.

I would appreciate any references to secondary literature on the subject.

Thank you in advance.

Namaste,

Heng Sure
