Balabhadra in his Horaaratna quotes the following verse from Varaaha(mihira):

yad upacitam anyajanmani zubhaazubha.m tasya karma.na.h paktim /
vya√±jayati zaastram etat tamasi dravyaa.ni diipa iva //

I have not been able to locate this verse either in the B.rhajjaataka or
the B.rhatsa.mhitaa. Does anyone recognize it? (References to similar
verses, linking astrology with karman, are also very welcome.)

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
