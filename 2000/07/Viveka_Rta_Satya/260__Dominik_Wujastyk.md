I'm afraid you don't understand what I'm getting at.  See, e.g., EH Carr's
What is History, or  RG Collingwood's The Idea of History.  In past
messages you have distinguished "theories" from "known facts".  But all
knowledge of the past is ultimately constructed and is therefore to some
extent contingent, and certainly filtered.  As we see from Farmer's
posting on Rajram's "horse"!

Incidentally, when I looked at http://www.safarmer.com/pico/delusion2.html
what I saw was a Rorschach inkblot.  :-)
