Dear Alf Hiltebeitel,

sorry I didn't mention your article: I answered in kind of a hurry and did
not have the time to look up my biblio-notes.

Could I use this occasion to ask you again, whether you would be willing to
contribute an article to our on-line journal for Tamil and Dravidian
culture, newKOLAM ? It now comes from Singapore where I am employed since
November 99.

The first S'pore-volume has just been launched
(http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/journal/kolam/index.htm) - the few remaining
technical difficulties (like the sometimes uncontrollable reaction of the
fonts etc.) will soon be eliminated...

Kind regards,
Ulrike

This Cenci buffalo sacrifice is also written up by me in a 1984 issue of the
journal _Uomo_, an issue on meat ed. by Christiano Grottanelli.
