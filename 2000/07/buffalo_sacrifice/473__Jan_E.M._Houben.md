Sacrifice of buffaloes is important and relatively common in Nepalese
rituals and it forms a major part in the peculiar Sacrifice of serpents
(unknown in other parts of the subcontinent, but which reminds us of king
Janamejaya's sacrifice in the Mahabharata) at the festival of Indrayani in
Kathmandu, of which a 108-minute ethnographic film was made by Dirk Nijland,
Balgopal Shrestha and Bert van den Hoek (distribution: Institute of Cultural
and Social Sciences. Film Library, Wassenaarseweg 52, NL-2333 AK  Leiden;
fax +31-71-5273619). The buffalo sacrifice takes place in a temple and it
precedes the sacrifice of serpents and some other wild animals.
See also Hoek, B. van den, and Balgopal Shrestha "The Sacrifice of Serpents
... " in Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient 79.1(1992)  pp.
