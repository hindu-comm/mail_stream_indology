I thank you too Dr. Witzel for calling me a surrogate.
With the current decline of politeness on the list it could have been much worse.
When I decided to forward Dr. Elst's message, who was so anxious to sign off,
I knew the risk I was running in being a forwarder/emissary.

After all, even Krishna was not spared, I am only a humble mortal.

As for surrogates, it is difficult in this devious world to decipher (even more than
the Harappan script) who is a surrogate of whom. But that should be the
subject of a political analysis list and not this.
