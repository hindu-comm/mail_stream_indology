FWIW,  Sikandar Cunningham's best guess for the site of the 'city of
Bukephala' was Jalalpur, situated plm 42 kms to the SW of Jhelum,
or plm 22 kms S. of Jogi-Tila (Gorakhnath-ka-Tila, the earlier
Balnath-ka-Tila, identified with Plutarch's 'Hill of the Sun'.)

Alexander Cunningham, The Ancient Geography of India, 1871,
Reprint Indological Bookhouse 1979, pp 134-149

My memory doesn't serve me well in case later researchers
repeated attempts to follow Alexander's footsteps.




BTW.
Rajarshi, IMHO you should use quotes (>).
