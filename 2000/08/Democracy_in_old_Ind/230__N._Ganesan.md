I have read UttaramErUr inscriptions of the Chola period a while
ago. In those, an election process of casting votes in an earthen
pot to get elected as a member of the governing council of a grAmam
is described. Especially, the qualifications to be a candidate
for a public office in great details.

Is this Chola period democratic process recorded anywhere else
in old India? Thanks for any references where these are discussed,
Chola or other medieval dynasties.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
