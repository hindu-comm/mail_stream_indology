Thanks for the reference. Makes for very interesting reading.

Corruption and inefficiency are good reasons to remove someone
from his post. But why debar all the relatives of such a man,
unless the default option was to make any such appointment
hereditary? Do we have evidence for what qualified a person to
be appointed to an administrative post in the first place?
