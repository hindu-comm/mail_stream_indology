***********
In school  Hindi, we had a couplet:
Rey  Gandhi[short a] mati-andh tu ittar sunghavat kaahi
Kar phulel ko aachman meetho kahat saraahi
Oh Gandhi, why do you ask dim-wits to smell your perfume
who loick it and say it is sweet.
Gaandhi could come from Gandhi, but I remember reading somewhere that the
word meant grocer.
