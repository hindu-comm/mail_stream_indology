The demon Hiranyakasipu was a fanatical atheist
and a persecutor of theists -- a perfect "naastika."
But according to the Bhagavata Purana, he chose
to be an atheist simply because that was the
fastest way for him to be re-united with God.   :-)  :-)

I love that twisted logic, but "binary" it isn't.
Or at least, not always.  That seems logical.  :-)  :-)
