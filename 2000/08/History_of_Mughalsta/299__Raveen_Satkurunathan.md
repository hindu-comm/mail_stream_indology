But Tamil Nadu and Kerala were never part of any pan Indian empires till
the advent of British Raj, hence the current apprehensions in the current
Delhi durbar regarding the credentials of Indian Tamils as Indians

(atleast) and also in many a discussions in this forum between those with
pan Indian credentials and with Tamil identity.
