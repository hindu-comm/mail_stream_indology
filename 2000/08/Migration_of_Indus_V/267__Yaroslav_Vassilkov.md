Excuse me, please, if it was mentioned already in some previous
postings, but Prof. B.B.Lal had studied the relation between South
Indian signs on pottery and IVC writing system in his article:
        B.B.Lal. From the Megalithic to the Harappa. - "Ancient India",
1960 (no page numbers in my records).
        Best regards
                                        Yaroslav Vassilkov
