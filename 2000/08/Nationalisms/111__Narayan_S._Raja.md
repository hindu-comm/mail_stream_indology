This is positively my last message on this topic.

I'd bet that no British administrator
ever starved to death in a famine.

Also, you say "correspondingly high mortality rate"
at least till the end of the 19th century.  But 1950
is 50 years after the end of the 19th century!

Indians weren't dying for lack of CAT scans!
Simple things like "boil your drinking water"
and "midwives, cut your nails and wash your
hands" would have done wonders.  No high tech
required.  But it would have required
a serious effort to educate the natives.

But the literacy rate in India in 1950 was 18%
(eighteen percent).  (Source:

At present, the literacy rate is about 63%.


Once again, I'm more annoyed with the Indians
than with the British.  The Indians should have
been more energetic in seeking literacy.  Still,
the British government comes across, AT BEST,
as hopelessly incompetent.


Best wishes,


Raja.
