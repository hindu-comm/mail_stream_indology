My own webpage on the Rajaram "horse" business, referred to by
Michael above, now has crosslinks to his article (as his does to
mine), so they form a pair.  Some minor editorial changes have
also been added today. To see the updated version, if you've
already loaded it, hit "refresh" or "reload" when you open the
page. Otherwise your browser will simply reload the old version
from its cache memory.
