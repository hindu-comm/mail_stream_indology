Has any study been done on the originality of Shankara's dialectic against
rival schools?

There's been constant dialectic duels between the various schools for a long
time before Shankara. Each school had probed the weakness of the doctrines
of rival schools and criticized them. So how much of Shankara's dialectic
against rival schools is original? How much of his criticisms have already
been brought out by earlier philosophers?
