In both cases we have to judge by the same rules.

If a scholar reads an old text wrongly or misinterpretes an old
picture we call it a mistake.

If he indulges in mistranslations or misinterpretations of old texts/pictures
in order to prove his theory, colleagues may suspect such a scholar to be
biased. Sooner or later his scholarly reputation would be ruined.

But when a man in order to prove his theory
        1) prepares a forged text which he declares to be old and
        authentic (as, for example, the so-called "Protocols of the
        Wise Men of Zion" - the notorious forgery, favourite of Nazis
        of all nations), or
        2) makes a forged picture which he declares to be old and authentic
        (as Dr.Rajaram seems to have done, see www.safarmer.com/pico/delusion3.html)-

we cannot call it a mistake. It is something else. You may choose the word yourself.

Regards,
