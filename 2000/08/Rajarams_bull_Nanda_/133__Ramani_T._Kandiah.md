Dear the one and only aura holding enlighten one, it is not munn, but maN.

Being a non-TamilNadu Tamil, I can not speak for Tamilnadu. However, I will
be happy if you could respond.

While agreeing that DK is not a friend of Brahmins, I will be happy if you
could prove the above 'incident' you have stated.

Noone claims that Tamil Brahmins are rich, but the issue is how they
manipulate the state.

I do not complain about every brahmin in TamilNadu, but a powerful brahmin
elite (From media to mutt) controls, and still acts.

>â€‰From time to time, in this list, you have shown your ignorance and
unreasonable hatred against Tamils. However, when you ask, "Did the Tamils
keep quiet in Sri Lanka?," I can say only one thing; "It is wise NOT
commenting on something when one does not know anything."

Thus, a humble suggestion to your excellency.
Why don't you restrict yourself within the topic in hand,
rather than dragging innocent parties for your mudslinging parties?

Above everything, criticising Tamils will not make any sex change in Dr.
Rajaram's horse's genitals.

Thank you very much for understanding, if you have lent ears.
(I believe, I. Mahadevan is also a Tamil Brahmin;-))
