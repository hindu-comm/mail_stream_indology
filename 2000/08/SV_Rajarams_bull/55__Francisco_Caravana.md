As a Portuguese member of the list I must say that we do, from the 5th grade
on (10-11 years of age) we learn about the "autos de f√©" (burnings) the
injustice of inquisition  trials, the slave trade, the killing of whole
cultures, the selling of indulgences by the catholic church (we are a mostly
catholic country) etc.. etc... on our school history books.

That did't happen before 1974, but then we had a fascist "nationalist"
government.

I don't think that it affects anyone's personality to know the truth, I
didn't stop loving my country because of that.
