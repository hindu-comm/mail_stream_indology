After some objective and semi-objective remarks, such generalizations
are "humorous" (pardon me for the word!).  Most Indians are more critical
of India than any western critic may imagine.  However Indians have just
come to learn to fight against sweeping arraogance.  Indians have not been
good chroniclers and the country depends on others for the
characterization and analysis.  Unfortunately "others"
have not been scholar historians.  Some Indians who reconstruct
are failing miserably.  It will change.
