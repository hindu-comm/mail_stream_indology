Indologists!

   The most relevant reference I've found on this is:

Rhys Davids -- "Similes in the Nikaayas: A Classified Index." Journal of
the Pali Text Society (1906-07), pp. 52-251 and (1908), pp. 180-188.

A related work which might be useful is Heramba Nath Chatterjee's
*Comparative Studies in Pali and Sanskrit Alankaaras* (Part
One) Calcutta: Sanskrit Pustak Bhander, 1960. [This has a separate section
on Upamaa.]

   I have perhaps 20 other references which are less closely related to
this topic, and those interested could contact me directly for
those. Sorry for the untimely response, but I'm on vacation!

itlu,
Tim Cahill
