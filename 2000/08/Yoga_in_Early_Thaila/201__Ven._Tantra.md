Could any list members offer clues of direct reference
to yoga in early Thailand/Siam? I have only "heard"
that there were relations between yogis/rishis and the
early Thai/Siamese courts.

So far, Kamaleswar Bhattacharya�s essay �The Religions
of Ancient Cambodia� (1997) has proved invaluable in
establishing the existence of yoga in Cambodia in the
ancient period.

With gratitude.

Ven. Tantra
