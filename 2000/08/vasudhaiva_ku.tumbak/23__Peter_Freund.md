Thomas Egenes replies that the reference to Manusmirti was corrected in later
editions of his book:
The expression vasudhaiva kuTumbakam is now referenced as Mahopanishad 6:71.

This can be found on page 452 of the Upanishatsamgraha. (Motilal Banarsidass,
1970)

Is this a sufficiently "ancient" Vedic source for the phrase?

Sincerely,

Peter Freund
