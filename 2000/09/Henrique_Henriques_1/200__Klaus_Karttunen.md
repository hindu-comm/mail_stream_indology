Waiting for the reprint, it can be noted that in fact there is an
edition of Henriques's grammar, though not in facsimile:

The first European Tamil Grammar. A critical edition by Hans J. Vermeer.
English version by Angelika Morath.XXVII+166 p. Heidelberg: Julius Groos
Verlag 1982.

The text is in Portuguese and Tamil, the "English version" means the
introduction and notes. The bibliography contains some additional
references. By the way, there are many ways to write the name of the
author: Enrique Enriquez, Henrique Henriquez, or -ques, in a
contemporary source even Anrrique Anrriquez.

Regards,
Klaus
