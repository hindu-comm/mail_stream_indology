I'm surprised to hear such an argument.  If the Constitution is not
honoured, change the Constitution!  If the law is not honoured, change the
law!  What guarantee is there that the new Constitution will be honoured?
The solution is not to change the Constitution but to make sure that it is
honoured.
Francis.
