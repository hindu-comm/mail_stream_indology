There's a faked up birch bark MS of the Bhagavadgita in the Rasashala
Aushadhaalaya collection made by Jivaram Kalidasa Shastri (aka
Charanatirtha Maharaj) in Gondal.  (The "Gondal" collection, and the MS,
are now in Jamnagar, in the library of the Gujarat Ayurvedic University.)

This MS has special extra verses which are said to make it a special and
unique copy of the BG, having ancient material missing in all other MSS.

I think Jivaram was duped, but he was a clever man with lots of editing
experience, so he must have been at least very willing to be duped.  He
published a text and translation of BG based on this MS.

I'm sorry, but I haven't paid enough attention to the text to know what
the import of these "newly discovered original verses" is.
