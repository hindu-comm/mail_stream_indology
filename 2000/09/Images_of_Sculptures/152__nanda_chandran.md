Would be grateful for any URL/web references to images of sculptures or
paintings of anything related to Indian Philosophy - similiar to the Goddess
PrAjnApAramitA pointed out by Ven Tantra - images of NAgArjuna, VardhamANa,
Patanjali, RAmAnuja, scenes from the Upanishads, Geetha etc

But not interested in images of popular Hindu Gods and Godesses - like
Shiva, Vishnu, Durga etc
