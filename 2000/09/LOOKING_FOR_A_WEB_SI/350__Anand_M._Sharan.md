My field is not literature but I have interest in broader issues which can
be called Indology . I find that my interests often are not intended for
this group which is meant primarily for those having interest in
literature .

Any one knowing about such a web site , pl post it on this web site .

I want to respond to the questions raised here on the following issues:

1. Jantar Mantar

2. What language did Buddha Speak ?

Thanks.

Anand M. Sharan
