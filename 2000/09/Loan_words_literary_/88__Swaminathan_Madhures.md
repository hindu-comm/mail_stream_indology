Are there many writers in Dravidian languages like Kannada, Telugu,
Malayalam, etc., where loan words from other langauges are replaced
with the native words? Called ha.le kanna.da, acca telugu, pacca malaya.lam,
how old are these schools?

Much like Urdu goes for Farsi/Arabic, Hindi for Sanskrit, Tamil for Tamil,
do the other literary languages of the Dravidian seek and replace foreign
loan words with natives?

Thanks,
SM
