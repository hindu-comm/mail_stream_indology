In the literature, one can find arguments that assign a date to the Bharata
battle ranging in round numbers from  3000BC to 1000BC..It is easier to date
the beginning of the iron age than to date the Bharata battle. It would be
better to fix the beginning of the iron age from independent sources and
then use this information to constrain the Bharata battle chronology ,rather
than the  other way round.
