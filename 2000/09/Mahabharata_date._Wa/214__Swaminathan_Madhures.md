 Exactly. Things get blown up out of proportions via oral transmission.
 Your efforts to push up the dates of MBh. and Iron age etc., by several
 centuries/millennia do not stand upto modern methods of dating.

 Not only the metrics and state of language (Eg., the Non-IA loans)
 of the epic are different. I wonder if the MBh itself is earlier than
 1700 BC, what about the Rgveda? Is it earlier than the Mature Harappan
 phase, but written in the Punjab area?! Also, all this will put
 the PIE home as India, which nowadays the lingusits don't seem to
 buy.
