Dear Dr.Allen W. Thrasher,Many of us are interested in the map of India at
the time of Mahabharata for one reason or the other. Will you be kind
enough to post it on the internet so that all of us have the advantage of
the gaining this new information. Please let us know the exact source and
address of the map. Is it possible to buy it at present from its source?
Thanks. N.R. Joshi.
