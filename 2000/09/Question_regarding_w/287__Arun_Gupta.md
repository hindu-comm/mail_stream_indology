Supposedly, the English word "calculate" comes from the Latin calculus, a
small stone used in reckoning.

The Hindu word for essay, "nibandh", supposedly comes from the method of
tying the loose leaves of a manuscript.

Are there any words in the classical languages of India which by their
etymology might give clues to the material culture involved in literary
composition, arithmetic, etc., in ancient India ?

Thank you,
-arun gupta
