Typically the talk of a mathematician: 'let x be parallel to y,...' But
who says that x and y are parallel in the first place? Once again:
reasoning that starts from dubious premises and imposes arbitrary
limitations (such as are grist on his own mill) on the topic under
consideration. From where did he get that "basic claim"? (Probably
no reference to academic literature there!) Indeed: no foggy clue of
what linguistics is.

By the same criterion, he must be one of those people who thinks
that Urdu is derived from Arabic and Persian - which would suit a
Hindutva purpose just fine. And Hindi will never have existed
independently of English - ha! what new perspectives and
possibilities! :-)))
