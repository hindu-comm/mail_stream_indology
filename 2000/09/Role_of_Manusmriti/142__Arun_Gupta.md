Since Indologists study what ancient Sanskrit texts
meant to their readers at various epochs, perhaps
they may comment on Madhu Kishwar's article on the
Manusmriti at

http://www.freespeech.org/manushi/117/manusmriti.html

as to whether her view on the role of the text is a
purely modern construction.

Thank you !
