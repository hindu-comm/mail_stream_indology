Dear Dr Fosse,

This suggestion seems to require, for a candidate
language to qualify as classical, an imperial context
whereby subject peoples use the language of the
imperial nuclear zone viz., Latin in the Roman Empire.

I'm not altogether sure this model is directly valid
in the Indian context esp. of Tamil.

In the case of Tamil, the elegant reasoning of AK
Ramanujan is certainly worth recalling - cf. Indology

Fernandez in the thread 'Classical vs. Modern'.

I hope that you do not require that a language be well
and truly dead for it to qualify as a Classical
language. This was another one of the arguments
advanced against Tamil's claims to being a Classical
language.

Thanks and Warm Regards,

LS
