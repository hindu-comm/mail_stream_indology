Have you seen samples of old Urdu? Can you derive an Urdu verb
(find one) from Persian?

The Gypsies of Europe are the decendants of those slaves.

Tasbih or bead-string came from India too. Arabic numerals too.

Where is this information from? The Khatris (from Punjab) dominated
the Kabul (and other cities in central Asia) markets until recently.

If he was impressed by Indian architecture, he had a way of expressing
it by plunder and destruction, as Al Biruni writes.

I think Indians (including Muslims in the subcontinent) should not
not forgive him. One must give him credit that he had in his court
Al Beruni and Ferdowsi (one a student of Hindu sciences, other a
recorder of Pre-Islamic history of Persia), although unhappily.
Certianly no hero to Hindus, he shouldn't be one to Indian
Muslims either.
