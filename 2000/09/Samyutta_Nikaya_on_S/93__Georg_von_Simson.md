To avoid misunderstandings: This is not a translation from Pali (the
TheravAda-version of the text) into Sanskrit, but the (fragmentary)
Sanskritversion (found in Central Asia) of the SarvAstivAda school of
Buddhism. The SarvAstivAdins also seem originally to have used a
middelindic dialect, but this was, for all we know, not identical with Pali.
