NG> Isn't the bronze age Greek culture (Minoan Crete) a non-IE one?
Interesting that even though the IE spread all over the world, the earliest
IE literatures recorded (Greece and Vedic) are from regions where great
non-IE cultures (IVC, for example) flourished before the IE intrusion.

say that they are non IE or non anything else.
I dont ride a horse to work, does that mean I dont speak IE.
