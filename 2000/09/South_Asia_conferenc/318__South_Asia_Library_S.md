 ***  Navigating between the oases of the Internet: SARAI and beyond  ***

During the upcoming South Asia Conference at Madison, the Committee on
South Asia Libraries & Documentation (CONSALD) will be presenting a
workshop to assist South Asia studies scholars and students to better
maximize use of the valuable resources that can be found on-line.  This
session will include a brief introduction to information gateways, search
engines and searching the Web, offer suggestions for evaluating quality of
Internet information, and highlight some of the resources for South Asia
studies teaching, learning and research.  It will be led by Dr. David
Magier, South Asia Librarian at Columbia University, who maintains South
Asia Resource Access on the Internet (SARAI).

All conference attendees are welcome.
