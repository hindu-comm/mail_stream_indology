In Urdu sample of 1200 AD how many percentage was of Turkish words, that of
Persian words and that of Arabic words? Are there Mongolian words in Urdu?
Mugal kings of Delhi were more Turkish than Mongolian. Is Turkish language
different from Persian? I am asking this question because Turkish people
descended from their country of Turkmenistan of northeast of Iran in the
7th and 8th century AD after Muslim Arabs destroyed Persian resistance of
1100 years (in stopping Turks to come down from 500 BC to 600 AD)in the 7th
century. Large horde of Turkish people went through Iran to Armenia and
Anatolia, massacred Christian population, occupied the counrty and even
changed its name to Turkey. A small horde of Turkish people descended on
Afghanistan, destroyed population there and setteled at places known as
Ghazni, Ghor. From there they started attacking India. Why Persian language
was more important than Turkish in Mughal/Turkish kings of Delhi?
