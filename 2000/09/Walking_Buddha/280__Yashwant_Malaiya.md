I have seen drawings of Buddha walking on lotus. I might be able
to find one on the web. Some of you may remember the scene in
Little Buddha where Buddha walks on lotus flowers.

I know a painting on the web showing a Jina walking on lotuses.
It is referred to often in Jainism, it occus in the Bhaktamara-
Stotra  for example.

It was once common for Jains to worship the dharma-chakra and to
place it at the feet of the Jina. It is occasionally still found
in some Jain temples as a yantra.

Thirukkural could not have been composed by a Buddhist because it
opposes not only killing of animals, but also consumption of
meat.
