See also Karel R. van Kooij's recent article "Iconography and the
Battlefield: the case of Chinnamastaa" in Violence denied: Violence,
Non-violence and the Rationalization of Violence in South Asian Cultural
History, ed. by J.E.M. Houben and K.R. van Kooij, Leiden: Brill, 1999. In
case the price of the book (ca. 100 US $) is a barrier I suggest you contact
Prof. van Kooij (krvankooij at rullet.leidenuniv.nl); he may be willing to send
you an offprint/photocopy of his article.
Yours, Jan Houben
