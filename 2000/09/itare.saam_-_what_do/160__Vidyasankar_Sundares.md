>Here is a question I try to find a satisfactory answer to:
>
>What is the meaning of Sanskrit word itare.saam (YogaS. I.20)?

mas. gen. pl. of itara = other.
The declension is as in tad -> te.saam, not as in raama -> raamaa.naam.

>Translation usually given in renderings of YogaS. is
>"other" "of other" which does not look satisfactory at all.

YS 1. 19 has videha-prak.rtilayaanaam.
itare.saam in 1. 20 means "of the others" i.e. not "of videhaaH or
prak.rtilayaaH".
