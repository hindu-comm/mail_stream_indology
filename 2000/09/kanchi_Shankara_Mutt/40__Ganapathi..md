I read the article written by Sri Vidyasankar Real History Of Kanchi Math
(Re:Former President Inaugurates
)Celebrations in the alt.hindu Newsgroup.
This article was written on the major issues covered in  The weekly cover
story of the Illustrated weekly Of India (Sept.13,1987) K.P.Sunil.

Page 3 and 4 of the article (Real History Of
.) give  the following
information
.

 Historians, however, hold that the Kumbhakonam math was in verity a
branch of the Sringeri math established in 1821 AD by the famous monarch of
Tanjore, Serfoji. (Mr.Sunil has a fact wrong here.The monarch of Tanjore in
1821 was not Serfoji but his son Prathap singh Thuljaji.The date 1821 is
correct.-it is the date of the oldest inscription found in the Kumbhakonam
Math building.) Later the war broke out between the kings of  Tanjore and
Mysore, the Kumbhakonam Math proclaimed independence from Sringeri and
established  itself as the Kamakoti Peetam.(there is no war documented
between the Maratha rulers of Tanjore and the Wodeyars of Mysore after the
1821.By this time, both were more or less puppets of the British. That the
Kumbakonam math proclaimed independence from Sringeri however is a fact
)

Mr.Sunil captures the major facts regarding the Kanchi Math correctly
though. Briefly,

1.A branch of the Sringeri math was established in Kumbakonam, the building
for which was constructed in 1821 AD, with the help of the Tanjore king

2.The Kumbakonam math soon proclaimed independence from Sringeri

3(2)Thus the kanchi math as an institution dates from 1842 AD
..

The findings of the author in the said article made me to look out for more
fine points on the subject. Therefore a discussion was initiated in the
indology group.

Sri Vidyasankar wrote..(23.08.2000) 
As an inscription dated 1821 is found
in Kumbakonam, it stands to reason that there must have been a matha there
for a few decades before that date. I dont think that people and
institutions suddenly come into being , on the date of the first available
written record
The question that causes the biggest controversy is whether
the said matha came to Kumbakonam in the first place and if so, when. That
is still to be addressed.

1.The  inscriptions relating to 1800 AD clearly mention the name of the
Math as the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and the modi documents of 18th and 19th
century also do refer the institution as the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and the
Peetadhipathi as the Shankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam.  Therefore
the existence of Kanchi Shankara Math at Kumbakonam  during this period is
proved beyond doubt.

2.The Kumbakonam Shankara Mutt inscription, according to Sri Vidyasankar
relates to 1821 AD.According to him the then ruler of Tanjore during this
period was not Serfoji  but his son prathap singh Thuljaji.


Ekoji I      1676-1684
Shaji       1684-1711
Serfoji I           1711-1729
Thukoji             1729-1735
EkojiII             1735-1736
Sujan bhayee        1736-1738
Kattu raja          1738-1739
Prathapa Simhan     1739-1763
Thulaja             1763-1787
Amarsingh           1787-1798
Serfoji II          1798-1832
Sivaji              1832-1855

>âFrom the above  genealogy list, we can infer  that the monarch was only
Serfoji II . Sivaji II was the son of Serfoji II and not Prathapa Singh
Thulajaji as given by Sri.Vidyasankar.

3.The date of this marathi  inscription was the 10th Feb.1822. According to
this inscription Raja Sri Chathrapathi Serfoji Maharaja built the Temple of
Chandramouleeswara (Chandramouleeswara Griham) in the Math.

4.Vidyasankar wrote.(27.08.2000)
That there was a Shankaracharya
associated with Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam in the 19th Century does not require
much proof. Around the 1700s is the crucial time period for which one
needs information.As for as one can make out from your mails, the modi
documents do not cover this.

The object of this interaction is to share the views on the issue whether
the Kanchi shankara Math has any historical evidence to prove its existence
at Kumbhakonam prior to 1820s as an independent Math. When some one has
been repeatedly saying that the Kanchi math is an institution dating from
1842 AD, the Math had proclaimed independence from Sringeri etc., it is
essential to take into account all the material available during this
period. Therefore, the Kumbakonam inscriptions and Modi Documents (which
cover a period of more than hundred years) shall not be rejected with out
assigning any reasons.

5.The Letter written to SivajiII contains information about the shifting of
Kanchi Math head quarters from Kanchipuram to Kumbakonam during the period
of Raja Prathapa Simhan. There are also records in connction with the Vyasa
pooja Offerings made to the kanchi Kamakoti Peetadhipathi during the
1760s.(Sri VidyaSankar might have the curiosity of  discovering more info.
from the 1700s. But  this can not reduce the importance of the documents
shown in support of my contention that the Kanchi Math had come to
Kumbhakonam during the period of Raja Prathapa simhan only as an
independent Kanchi Math and it is highly ridiculous to claim it as a sub
math of  Sringeri).

6. It was also mentioned in one of my earlier postings that the Tanjore
Kings had extended their patronage to various other maths. Sringeri Math
had not been referred in any of these Documents. Hence the tentative
assumptions that a branch of the Sringeri math was established in
Kumbakonam, the building for which was constructed in 1821 AD, with the
help of the Tanjore king  etc., are not backed by any proof.
