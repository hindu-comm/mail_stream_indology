There, of course, also is:

Nanda, Sarena (1993): Hijras: an alternative sex and gender role in India.
- In: Herdt, Gilbert (ed.): Third sex, third gender: beyond sexual
dimorphism in culture and history. New York, NY: Zone Books, pp. 373-417

which has become a classic text in gender and queer studies, as well as
several works by Wendy Doniger, from Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical
Beasts to Splitting the Difference: Gender and Myth in Ancient Greece and
India.

Best,

Heike
