'>'Thieme proposed a derivation from Skt. uru- 'broad, wide' and=20
'>'khara/khala- 'thrashing floor', with "popular" _l_ (which, given the=20
'>'hymn in which it occurs, is not unreasonable). The braahmaNa=20
'>'literature has its own popular etymologies.

     Is not khala = 'threshing floor' a Dravidian word ?
