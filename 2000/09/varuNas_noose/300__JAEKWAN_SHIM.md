Anybody know are there further discussions on <varuNa's noose> in context of
darzapUrNamAsa ritual since Stephanie Jamison commented (Sacrificed
Wife/Sacrificer's Wife) on F.M. Smith's reading. I know the one by Julia
Leslie(Menstruation Myths), but other else ?
Welcome any comments on this subject.
