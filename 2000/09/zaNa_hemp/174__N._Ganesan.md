  Ka. "gONi" is cognate with tam. "kONi".
  Also, there is an ancient word, "kaNam pul"(="kaNam" grass).
  One of the 63 Shaivaite saints of the first millennium is called
  "kaNampulla nAya_nAr" who made a living
  by cutting and selling this "kaNam" grass.
  Tamil "kaNam" is probably the same as the Vedic "zaNa".

  >DED  records very less number of modern KannaDa words

  Regards,
  N. Ganesan
