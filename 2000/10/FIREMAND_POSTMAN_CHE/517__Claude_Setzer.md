Please see my recent post on Spoken Sanskrit movement. They are very active
in Bangalore India at least and give regular long term classes there (months
or years) with a lot of people living there basically permanently and
speaking nothing but Sanskrit. They also give regular classes all over the
US and had a one week Sanskrit Camp in California this last summer. I think
they will be eager to put your university on there regular visit list if you
write to Vasuvaj.
