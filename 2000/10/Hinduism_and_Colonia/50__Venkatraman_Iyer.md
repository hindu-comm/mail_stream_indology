>I agree with you and with Lorenzen that Hindu contrasted with Turk (or
>Musalman) meant something tangible for Kabir's audience.

Even in the South, Vijayanagar kings held the title,
"hiMdurAyasuratrANa". suratrANa and suratALu in Kannada
inscriptions is evidently a sanskritization in 1350s
of the term, sultan. This is much earlier than Kabir's
times. In the Karnataka kings' titles
Hindu obviously meant a religious category different
from Muslims.

Does Lorenzen discuss these inscriptions of the Vijayanagar era?
Especially so when his earlier work on Kapalikas & Kalamukhas
deals mainly with the Deccan.

Best regards,
V. Iyer
