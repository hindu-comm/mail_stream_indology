Not very much so, if non-heretical means "Brahminical". Already in chAndogya
upanishad, you have the statement, AcAryavAn purusho veda. But if heresy
simply refers to its etymological meaning of choice, yes, all isms in India
are heresies, including the Brahminical institution of sacrificial
priesthood.
