If you only take trouble to look into some Hindu sacred texts, such as,
e.g., PurANas, you would find that, according to them, Lord NArAyana took
his Buddha avatar for only one reason: to tempt the sinners and heretic with
the worst possible, false doctrine and in this way make sure that they will
not escape hell. Do you mean it is in this particular way the Buddhism was
developed and sustained by the Hindus?
