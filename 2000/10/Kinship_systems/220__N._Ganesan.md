To know whether Gonds are Dravidians or not,
I suggest a starting point. In Sanskrit, DraviDa/dramiDa
is from "thamizh". It was Walter Elliot, a British civil
servant, who first noted the genetic relationship of the language
of Gonds with that Dravidian languages like Telugu, etc.,
This happened several years even before Caldwell.

Walter Elliot, Observations on the Language of the
Gonds and the identity of many of its terms with
Telugu, Tamil and Canarese, 1847, Jl. of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal.
