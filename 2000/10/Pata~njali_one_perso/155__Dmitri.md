Dear Indology memebers,

The legend has it that the author of Yoga Suutra is the author of
Mahaabhaashya.

Are there any reasons to believe that legend?
Say, are there "stylistical similarity" or "lexicon similarity"
studies between Yoga Suutra and Mahaabhaashya?

I would appreciate references and/or
pro- & contra- arguments for the attribution of
Yoga Suutra and Mahaabhaashya to the same person.

Best regards, Dmitri.
