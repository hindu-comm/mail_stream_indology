Dear members of Indology,
The Mahabhasya does not contain any Yogic references except those for the
YAUGIKA words! It seems that the author of the Mahabhasya, was certainly
different from the author of the Yogasutras though possessing the same name.
Otherwise one must hand it to Patanjali if he could manage to make so
water-tight compartments of his mind and reason while authoring the two
texts.
