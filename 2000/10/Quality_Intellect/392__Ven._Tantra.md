Quality Intellect

Forum Members:

I would like to suggest that essential quality does
not in any way require "qualification," and that the
sole requirement for participating in this Electronic
"Indian Studies" Forum is that one be in possession of
a quality intellect. The question to this forum, then,
might rather be stated as, "What distinguishes a
quality intellect?"

In the context of this forum, I would further suggest
that a quality intellect would express itself in a
clear-cut, elucidating, and above all endearing manner
that imbues not only our immediate forum, but the
broader intellectual community, and--why
not?�"humankind as a whole" with the very
inner-workings its quality.

Our wide-ranging backgrounds should have nothing at
all to do with this. A quality intellect should
certainly be able to crap the cut right away.
