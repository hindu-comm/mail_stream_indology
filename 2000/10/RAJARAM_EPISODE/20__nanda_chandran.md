Who am I? A politician to take such a stand? I only said that many
Hindus feel that way. In the same vein are we to believe that when
you clamoured for Hindus to return JainA and Buddhist temples, you
were speaking for the said groups?

>talks of 'getting back' what he considers their 'most important temples'.

How can I get it back? I'm only arguing against the unfairness of the
situation.

This effort to tar me in "Hindu fundamentalist" colours, is so typical
of Indian leftists who do the same with anybody who attempts to speak up
for Hinduism.

No, you didn't. You only tried to label Hinduism as "war mongering" and
"preaching hatred towards other religions"!

In short, those who agree with your views on India. For others who
disagree, it is the guillotine, I guess!
