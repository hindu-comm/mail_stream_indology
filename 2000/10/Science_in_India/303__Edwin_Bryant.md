I'm not too sure what Steve Farmer's agenda is, but these remarks seem
unnecessarily provocative, inflammatory and incredibly over-generalized
(given that they seem to be based on one article in a magazine and some
anecdotal discussions with a handful of students).  So much for all the
harangues to which we have been subjected on this list about the
importance of doing thorough research on a topic before voicing an
opinion.
