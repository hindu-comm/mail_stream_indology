>Does 'Dravida' in Sanskrit mean Tamil-like or Tamil itself?

"Thamizh" gets modified in Sanskrit as
dramiDa/draaviDa.

>then where does it leave terms like  Pancha dravida and Dramidacharya?

Good question. Have the puranic authors who were writing
about Pancha-draavi.das had the knowledge of traditional
dravi.da lands?

Best wishes,
Prasad
