Dear List Members,

A friend of mine is planning to study the poetry of the Poet Saints of
Maharashtra.  He will be beginning studying modern Marathi in Long Island
New York and then he will be going to Maharashtra for the period of June
thru August 2001 to study there.  Can anyone recommend any contacts
(individual or institutional) in Maharashtra to help him learn both modern
and old Marathi and to help guide him into the study of the poetry of the
Poet-Saints.  (I already have the contact from the old posting of Ashok
Aklujkar for Prof. Arjunwadkar)

Many thanks,


Harry Spier
