I would be very interested in getting information about the genealogies of
Vatsyayana - the one who redacted the Kamasutra. Does he have any
connection with the Bhargavas?

Is there any work on the transmission of sexual knowledge in the 17th and
18th centuries? Any work about Islamic and popular traditions of sex
manuals?

I will be extremely grateful for such information.

regards

Kaushik Bhaumik
