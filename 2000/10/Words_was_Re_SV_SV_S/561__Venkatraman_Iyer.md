It may be of interest that in Tamil "renaissance"
was rendered as "maRumalarcci" long ago. Done by RasikamaNi
TKC whose role was important in making Bharatanatyam
popular. Rukmini Devi had her KuRavanji dance in his
bungalow first. TKC also translated "culture" as
"paNpATu".

Is it Tagore who coined "kalAsAram" to mean "culture"?
To get an account of (tech) english vocabulary coinages
in Sanskrit, it is better to see it in high Hindi, Telugu, ...
duurdarshan = tolaikkATci, aakaashvaani = vaa_noli,
pager = akavi, WWW = vaiyavalai, vaiya-viri-valai,
internet = iNaiyam, ....

Regards,
V. Iyer

PS: The words, "caivam" and vaiNavam" appear in Tamil
texts several centuries before British entered India.
