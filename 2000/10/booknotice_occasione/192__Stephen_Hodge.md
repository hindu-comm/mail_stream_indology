There is also the theory presented by David Stoppard Flattery and
Martin Schwarz in their "Haoma and Harmaline" that Haoma / Soma was
the harmel plant, based on Iranian sources.  This theory also explains
why ephedra is often linked to Soma -- you need it in combination with
harmeline to stay alert / awake.  Seems more convincing to me than the
Amanita muscaria theory.
