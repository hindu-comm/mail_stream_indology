No one is complaining about Muller or what people of his era
wrote.
If you have noticed the complaint is about nonsense like
'vedic tanks' and efforts at cooking up textual evidence
to show 'pregnant memory' of a Aryan migration into
India.

IMHO, concepts such as Orientalism or Neo-orientalism
are not needed - it can be attributed to simple petty
prejudice and a self serving need of entrenched academics
to see that previous papers/books do not become redundant.
