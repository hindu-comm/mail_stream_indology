Please get your facts right first. The Indian constitution
still defines India as a Union of states. That has not
changed. Even as you read this, three new states are being
created within the Indian union.

India declared herself to be a Republic in the year 1950,
when Indira Gandhi's papa was the Prime Minister. Does
the date 26 January ring a bell? If you want more detail,
the preamble to the Indian constitution, adopted on 26
November 1949, called India a "Sovereign Democratic
Republic". In 1977, this was amended to read "Sovereign
Socialist Secular Democratic Republic." The additional
two words were Indira Gandhi's contribution.
