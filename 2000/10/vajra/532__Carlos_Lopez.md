> As a student of Buddhist Tantra, I am interested in how Indra's Vajra came

> been looking at the occurrences in the Rigveda, and notice that it is
> sometimes described as made or iron or metal and with edges (sounding much
> like the Tibetan rdo rje). Macdonell mentions that it is "sometimes spoken
> of as a stone or rock." Does anyone know what he is referring to,

> works or monographs on this interesting word?
