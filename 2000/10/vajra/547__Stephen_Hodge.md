Wow, the flattery :))

As we have seen, "vajra" has two connotations: "lightning" and
"diamond" and I believe it is used in Buddhism with both senses.  When
thinking of it as a symbol, was it not first thought to be the weapon
of choice of Indra rather like Thor's hammer ?   As an important
element in its long journey to becoming a specifically tantric symbol,
one should also consider the history of Vajrapaa.ni who already
appears in sculpted representations in Gandhara style statuary --
where he is sometimes depicted in the Hellenistic form of Herakles.
Somewhat later, and thus giving rise to the early tantric three-buddha
family scheme, one finds `Shaakyamuni flanked by Vajrapaa.ni paired
with Avalokite`svara -- one with a vajra and the other with a lotus.
The possible covert sexual symbolism here should be obvious :)

Yes.

Many use `n for this purpose but others solutions exist.  One
publisher said to me that they did not believe in using diacritics in
their books because of the trouble and since the uninitiated general
reader would not understand them while Sanskritists would know what
was intended anyway -- a bit radical and not foolproof !
