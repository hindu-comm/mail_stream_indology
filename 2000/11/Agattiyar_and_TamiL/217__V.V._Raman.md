This is to request Tamil/Sanskrit scholars on this list to present
their interpretation of the view in the Tamil tradition that Rishi Agastiya
brought the Tamil language and culture to the people of the South,
also refer to the place and time of the first mention of this statement.
This may have some relevance to the Aryan/Dravidian debate. Perhaps not.
Thank you,
V. V. Raman
