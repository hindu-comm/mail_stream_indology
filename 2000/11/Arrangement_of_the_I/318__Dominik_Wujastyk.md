Dear Axel,

The kind of threaded presentation you want is available if you read
INDOLOGY from it's web archive.

David Salmon's suggestion about automatically sending messages to a
special folder is also excellent.  That's what I do myself.  Then I can
sort messages by subject, date, sender, etc., as I please.
