This is a wholly unconvincing argument.  One example from Jainism
which, if Mr. Bothra states it correctly, is an equation of light/good
dark/evil that is not unique either to Jainism or to India, does not
prove that racial and colour bias arose in India only after and
because of Western imperial dominance.
