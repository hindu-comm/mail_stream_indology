Dear V,

You might be interested in knowing that 'culturally' IA Sinhlaese in Sri
lanka too are fond of calling their loved ones as Kalu (black). It is still
a term of endearment. Kalu Banda was a common name in rural areas.
Kaakavana Tissa (Black Tissa) was the name of the father King Duttu Gamini
the hero of Mahayana.  There are some references on this, if interested I
can find some for you.

Raveen
