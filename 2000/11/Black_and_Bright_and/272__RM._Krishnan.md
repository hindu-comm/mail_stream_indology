Without knowing (?) the basic meaning, Tamil Brahmins (especially the
mothers) do call children as 'kaNNa'. They think they are referring to
Krishna. But then both Krishna and kaNNa are different rendering of the
same. - black. It is as if calling a child with love as 'Blacky'.

Interesting, is it not? 'En kaNNullE, En kaNNuk kutti'

With regards,
irAma.ki
(Krishnan alias kaNNan)
