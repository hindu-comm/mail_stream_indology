Peter Wyzlic cited Basham :
>"It has been suggested that the Panis were Semitic traders, but the
>evidence is so slight that this conclusion cannot be accepted."

Apologies for the slight slip on the out-of-memory citation - Basham only
refers to that theory, and does not wholly approve of it. But the
reference to `Semitic' is apparently implicitly a reference to Phoenician
traders.
