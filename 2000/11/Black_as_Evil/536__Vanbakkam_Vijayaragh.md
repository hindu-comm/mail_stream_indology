For someone who seems to be so concerned with negative portrayal  of black
colour in the vedas and the "loathing of black skin  and black color " , it
is ironic he should rely exlusively on the writings and interpretations of
whites and disregard the opinions and interpretatins of blacks. If someone
puts on a pedastal the interpretations given by ethinc whites as paradigm
of truth, integrity, profundity in contrast to the interpretations of
Indians, why this excessive concern about "racism" in Vedas?
