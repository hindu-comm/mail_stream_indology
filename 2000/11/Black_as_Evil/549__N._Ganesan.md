People say widows wear white because wearing colorful clothes may
increases desires. White being a symbol of satva guNA may give peace
of mind. These white clothes are not really sarees, but they are just
men's "dhoti", usually the dead husband's garments. This practice is
not followed any where in AP. That generation died away. Nowadays
widows wear all colors.

There is a clear difference between a white cloth of dead husband,
and a formal white saree.
>>

There are social reformation movements to change the
ancient habit, mentioned in old Tamil texts. So that
widows can wear any saree. In Tamil Nadu,
widows among many castes wear white sarees, *not* the dead
man's dhoti. This includes ladies from Telugu castes
like Reddiars and Nayudus.

N. Ganesan
