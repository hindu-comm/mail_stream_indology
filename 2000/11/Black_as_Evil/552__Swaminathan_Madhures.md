This supposedly "universal" myth that opposites in duality
- Black and White that is easily mapped onto Evil and Good
respectively in a unidirectional way, is pure *fiction*.
Generated in fuzzy religious discourses by New Age tantrics.

And, as you know, Lord Krishna is black, see his name
kRSNa = black in Sanskrut. His Blueness is euphemism.

In ancient India, white is the color of mourning, and
worn by widows. OTOH, Black is worshipped: Dravidian
has nalla- meaning both "good" and "black".

 Clarification: This sentence on anti-semitism is not
 written by me.
