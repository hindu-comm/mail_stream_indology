Scholars have repeatedly emphasized that Dravidians are mediterranean
caucasoid. (See KAN Sastri, Michigan Papers 1978, first article, Zvelebil etc.)
Associating flat-nose/curly-hair with Dravidians seems to be a layman's
(mis)conception stereotyping the prevalently dark skintone as going
hand-in-hand with non-caucasoid features.  Many laymen would be surprised to
find that even the scheduled castes of Tamilnadu have caucasoidal features.
Schedules tribes are a different matter but then they are historically not
mainstream Dravidians.

That is really a problem created by Indian laymen both Dravidians and
Sanskritists not the much viled western Indologists who are actually in a
better position to view these facts.

I am often surprised to see in movies and informal videos of country side and
in photos appearing in scholarly books how featured Dravidian people are...
Actually a 1970s book by an American on Dravidian local goddesses, comments
below a photo of a group of country Dravidians (do not remember whether
scheduled caste or not) something to the effect of "note the caucasoid
features..".
