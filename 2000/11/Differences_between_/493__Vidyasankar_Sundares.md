This is a bit confusing. Do you mean to say that the word is
sometimes recited as "namas" and sometimes with a visarga when
occuring *within* the same text-string? As far as I can notice,
this is not the case. I'm not denying that the word can be and
is recited as ~as in a certain context. Where the pronounciation
is ~as (or ~az), it is because of the next word beginning with
a sibilant or a c or t sound.
