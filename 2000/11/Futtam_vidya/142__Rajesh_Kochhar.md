In our school Hindi text there was a doha (couplet)
Uttam vidya lijiye yadyapi neech pe hoye.
Parho apavan thor pe kanchan tajat na koye.

You should accept good knowledge from anybody,even a "lowly" person. Just as nobody will not pick up gold even if it were lying in an impure  place.
The moral is:While reading other people's posting.look for   a nugget of wisdom,not for impurity.
