Griffith transltated RV.61.5-9 in Latin and passed over it to his appendix.
Moreover the stanza 5-8 in Latin, but 9 in English again. He added that the
whole passage is difficult, obscure, unintelligible... .
A professor make a joke that the stanza is too obscene to translate, but
seriouslly, was it a usual manner to do this in his days? 
Any antiquus can guess or read his mind?
