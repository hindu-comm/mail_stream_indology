I am studying the archaeology of a temple in Vietnam and think that one of
the figures depicted may be that of Hayagriva.  One of the guardian figures
of the temple is certainly the fierce emanation of Avalotikesvara. However,
I am finding it difficult to find out more about this figure. Could anybody
point me in the direction of scholarly works about this god/ bodhisattva.
