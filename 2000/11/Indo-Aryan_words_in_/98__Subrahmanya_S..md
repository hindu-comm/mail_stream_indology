Question to MW: Is it not possible that Mittani basically has
archaic forms because it is in the periphery.

Also, I do not see how you can draw any conclusions about
the age of the RV itself from this ? Unless, you have some other
independent way.

FYI - This question is really to know the answer coz I am
curious, it is not a rhetorical one.

Regards,
Subrahmanya
