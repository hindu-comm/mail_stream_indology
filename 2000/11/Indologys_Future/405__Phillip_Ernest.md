Let me second this.  He sent me a personal e-mail when I responded on list
to his original post-- which was, admittedly, regrettably obscure on which
opinions were his own, and which ones he was only representing as current
in some circles.  Let's save ostracisation for really heinous crimes of
malice.  I know he meant to do not harm, but was only alerting us to this
trend of thought, of which we should all be aware, and should discuss, as
we have been doing.
