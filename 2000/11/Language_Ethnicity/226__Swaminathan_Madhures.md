Recently there was a question on the connextion between
ethnics and their mother tongues. Between ethnic troibals
and their Dravidian dialects/languages. This is a complex
question, and the language passion by ethnic groups cannot
be easily dismissed. The Oxford university is publishing
a book on this affinity value in the postmodern Europe.
Due next month.

Sure, Indologists will take sometime to discuss this
important issue in the third world underclasses -
on ethnic Gonds or Tamil paRaiyar.

Language and Nationalism in Europe

This book examines the role of language in the present and past
creation of social, cultural, and national identities in Europe.
It considers the way in which language may sometimes reinforce
national identity (as in England) while tending to subvert
the nation-state (as in the United Kingdom).
