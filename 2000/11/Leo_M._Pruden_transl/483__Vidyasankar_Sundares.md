Lamotte, Etienne. Karmasiddhiprakarana : the treatise on action
by Vasubandhu; English translation by Leo M. Pruden. Berkeley,
Calif.: Asian Humanities Press, 1988.

LC call no. : BQ2957 .L3613 1988 (from http://catalog.loc.gov).

Potter's online bibliography for the EIP volumes is available
at <http://faculty.washington.edu/kpotter/ckeyt/home.htm>. It
is not very easy to search, but I've found it worth the effort.
It works in conjunction with the third revised edition of Vol.
1 (1995). Complete bibliographic references are given for things
published after 1995. Earlier references need to be located from
the print version of volume 1.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
