Dear list members,

George Thompsons posting about a new book in Avestan studies has nudged me
into asking a question about an old book in Avestan studies that I've been
wondering about for a while.

In the preface to A.V. Williams Jackson's "An Avesta Grammar in Comparison
with Sanskrit Part 1" dated 1891 it says "The second volume (Part II), a
sketch of the Syntax, with a chapter also on metre, is already half in
print, and is shortly to appear".  But the catalogue entry for the book in
the New York Public Library Oriental Collections says that part 2 was never
published.  Does anyone know whatever happened to it.  Does it still exist
somewhere perhaps as a manuscript gathering dust in some university archive
or is it lost forever.

Many thanks,



Harry Spier
