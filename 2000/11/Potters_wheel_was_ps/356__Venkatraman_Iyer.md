(Apa)Bharani constellation and potters
http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE?A2=ind9806&L=indology&P=R21221

A 2000 year old poem from puRanA_nURu explicitly
compares the spokes of a Potter's wheel with the
chariot wheel spokes! Tho' this is not mentioned
in english translation.

<<<
The full creative control exercised by the potter is also compared to
the control of a king over his land in the following Classical Tamil
poem.

vETkO ciRAar tEr kAl vaitta
pacu maN kurUu tiraL pOla avan2
koNTa kuTumittu i taN paNai nATu E             (puRanAn2URu 32.7-10)

A rough translation is: This cool cultivated land of his crown is his
(to do whatever he wishes) in the same manner as the colorful lump of
clay which the potter children placed on the potterÂ’s wheel (can be
made into anything the potter wishes).
