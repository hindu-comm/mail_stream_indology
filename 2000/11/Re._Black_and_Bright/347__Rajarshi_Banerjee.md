Few africans are really that dark to shine blue and purple. The ones that
are are extremely striking looking.

Many east africans are really impressive and good looking and could have
inspired such references. As for indians such complexions (and looks :-))
are almost non existant.

I would argue that such references in literature are just idealizations
based on some chance sighting or anecdotes. Similar to phrases like white as
snow. Platinim blondes are also rare and definitely stand out.
