The problem with the AIT is not that the theory as such has been stated,
but that value judgements were assigned to Aryans (=good) and Dravidians
(=bad). Here, Europeans have a lot to answer for, and many Europeans have
done their utmost to redress the damage that traditional racism created.
(Unfortunately, some Europeans persist doing evil in this respect, but at
least they are not unopposed). What should be dealt with is not the theory
of migrations into India, which certainly took place, but the racist and
political notions that have been associated with these theories, and that
are completely irrelevant to them.

Difficult to say. About every third word a Scandinavian utters has an
impeccable Low German etymology, so maybe your on to something :-).
