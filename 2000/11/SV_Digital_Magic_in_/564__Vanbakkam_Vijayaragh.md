It is not just value judgements, but even the identification aryan vs
dravidian is unwarranted. The vedas themselves do not speak of dravidian,
even the word itself is not mentioned, but vedic people were at odds only
with dasyus - sometimes . The vedic people were unaware of such a group as
dravidians. If you have a better information, let me know.
