I think you are mixing up the concepts of "race" versus language/language
family. A black American speaking English (or Spanish) speaks an
Indo-European language (Aryan, or rather Indo-Aryan being reserved for the
Aryan languages of India). But a black American is obviously not an
Indo-European or a "Caucasian" in racial terms, he is an African. The
relationship between "race" and language has been discussed on this list
before. I suggest you take a look at the archives. Mind you, the term
"race" is complicated and fraught with difficulties. After multivariate
analysis was introduced in the late fourties, it became clear that there
are a number of different criteria (not only skin colour) that can form the
basis of a racial definition. Biologists disagree about the number of human
races, and Africans vary considerably between themselves.
