Like the DMK election posters when Kamaraj was alive, he was called
'Appirikka azhage' in a snide and depracating way. Kamaraj was black, but
the Dravida political parties used to downgrade him as 'African beauty'?

Or like the big cut-outs along the Anna Salai in Madras, where even people
like Mooppanar have rosy cheeks and their faces 'whited out' so that they
are saleable electorally to the Tamil population?
