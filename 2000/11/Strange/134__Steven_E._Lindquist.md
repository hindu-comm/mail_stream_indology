Dear V.V. Raman and the list,

Please do not misunderstand my post.  I was in NO WAY referring to your
discussion of Endo-Exo Indologists, which I followed with interest and found
thoughtful (though I may not really fit either category).  What I was
referring to by "devolve" was simply the personal or non-academic attacks
which had occurred previously, but unfortunately, simultaneously with your
posting.  I was attempting to avoid another "outburst."  I regret any
confusion.

In my mind, thoughtful comments (from any perspective) are always welcome,

Steven
