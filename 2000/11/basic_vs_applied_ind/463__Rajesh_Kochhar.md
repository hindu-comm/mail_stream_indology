I wonder whether it is fair to distinguish between Indian Indologists and Western Indologists. It may be more meaningful to distinguish between basic Indology and applied Indology.Perhaps, Indians settled abroad,apprehending the loss of their cultural identity and gene pool through intermarriages in the next two to three geneartions ,would like to maintain a certain level of  cultural tension.As a reaction thereto, or otherwise,many basic Indologists may be tempted to make statements which would be deleted by the editor/referee  if included in a paper submitted to. a reputed journal.
