Valerie Roebuck already pointed to bRhadAraNyaka 4. 4. 22.
Another reference in the same text is 3. 5. 1. See also

mahAnArAyaNa 12. 14 - na karmaNA na prajayA ... amRtatvam Anazu.h
maitrAyanI 4. 3. 4 - hanti karma zubhAzubham prasannAtmA Atmani sthitvA

These two texts may not be as early as bRhad, but should be early
enough. Also, the mahAnArAyaNa verse is probably the most quoted one
in this respect, in the later Vedanta literature.
