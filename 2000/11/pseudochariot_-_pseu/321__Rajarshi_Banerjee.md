No crack in Sethna's piece, but willfull alteration of evidence. Compare his
diagram with the originals on the following page. The pictorial evidence
speaks for itself:

1) OK,  I would be interested to know what you would interpret from this
symbol.

2) What are your thoughts on the fact that the ovals could actually be
circles in perspective.
>
3) Are you aware that circular versions of this symbol also exist in
abundance.

All sethana's does is to redraw the ovals as circles which acually detracts
form making the symbol look like a chariot.
Its not surprising that a  2 wheeled vehicle could be depicted as a
pictorial because they did exist. You must have seen the daimabad bronze
toy. It is hitched up with oxen. The wheels are solid but then its only a
toy. There are some toy wheels with spokes painted on them dating from late
or mature harappa. No actual wheels have ever been found.
