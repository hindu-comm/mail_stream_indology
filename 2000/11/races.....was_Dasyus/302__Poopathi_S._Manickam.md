That's why.. India is a subcontinent.. Right..? <g>

Well.. there may be some spill over all across
the (Kongan) coastal line (since 11th Century ?))
from the busy waters of Kodungaa(nal)loor and Goa..?

it's a very very microscopic minority..
and some of the Utah (U of Utah) based genealogists
and others (?) (not geneticists.. so to speak))
"carefully" gathered those strains of data
(DNA samples.. a multi-million dollar project)
and testified an additional scripture along with
their Book of Mormon..?!? (genetical version.. that is ) ;-p

Seriously..
Kurumban.. (meaning pepper corn (Kuru milahu) haired one..?)
mostly living in the wilderness of the Western Gates..
..even in this dispensation and age..!
(where the world famous Tellicherry pepper corns (thalai chEry;)
are in great abundance)) and their domesticated brethren..
the so called paNiyan.. (meaning errand boy?)
are NOT from the Negroid stock even according
to the revelations and standards of their prophets
Joseph Smith/Brigham Young et al. :-)


Kind Regards.../poopathi S. Manickam (Seattle)

ps: Have you had a chance to review the
latest break through research (Euro-Centric)
on (copy righted) Y-chromosomes..?
just listened  couple "nimites" ago on the NPR ..
if not..never mind.. :-)))
