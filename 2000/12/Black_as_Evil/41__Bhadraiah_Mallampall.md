Dear list members

Brain storming is a good idea, and brings out a wealth of informaion. But I
believe if all active members have contributed at least once, further
discussions can be need based. Let us not look back who started it. Probably
it was started in good faith.

Is any one writing a paper on the issue? Has the question been answered by
the list satisfactorily? Is the paper ready?

Questions to avoid:
Is any further information needed (oh no)?
What are the conclusions (no please!).

regards
Bhadraiah
