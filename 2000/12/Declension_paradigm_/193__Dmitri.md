Dear Indology memebers!

What dictionary (if any) might be consulted to find out which
declension paradigm was actually used in Sanskrit MSS as far as particular
words are concerned?

For example, word nidrA -- is it following jA paradigm or senA ?
My cursory search through library staks yielded no results -- please,
help if you can!

Best regards, Dmitri.
