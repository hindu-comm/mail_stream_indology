   There is no mention of "western" endowments, funds can come from
   east (eg. Japan or India) or west for Dravidology studies, we
   don't mind.

Several months before you started writing in the list,
the list founder forwarded a request for for funds
from you. Seeking support for Dravidian studies is no different.

   as they are practised now?

   You wrote about "Padiri" Caldwell, and the hostility and riots against
   the Reverend's theories. Is this so? Where can i read about them?
