One of the earliest Lingam representaions with Shiva
as Kapardin standing on a dwarf is in GuDimallam.
This lingam is a clear representation of the male phallus.

But, I agree that in Saiva siddhantam from 5th century
no one talks of Shiva as a phallic symbol. In fact,
PeriyapuraaNam says Lingam is the aru-uru. Something
a symbol in between Form and Formless. Something like neither
1 nor 0 in binary math.

Regards,
N. Ganesan
