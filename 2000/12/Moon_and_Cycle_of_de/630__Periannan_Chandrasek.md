But Bhagavatha purANa would not exacly qualify for an "ancient" Skt. text.
It is a medieval composition. Moreover it was authored in Tamilland by a Tamil
or someone who was immeresed in local Tamil culture and customs including
vocabulary. One of the give-aways by way of vocabulary is "avamocana" for "inn"
a raw translation of the Tamil verbal nouns "viTuti" or "vITu" < Ta. viTu = to
stay, to leave, to be liberated.

It abounds in very Tamil-only traditions
and ideas such as the pAvai vow.
