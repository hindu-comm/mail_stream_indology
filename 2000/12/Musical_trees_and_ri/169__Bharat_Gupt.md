Could we not read this line to mean as:

Vanaspati, Nadii, uccitikaa, taala are the s.abdah ( sounds,sound patterns
) produced on muraja and others (drums).

Does this fit in with the context of the line ? I am ammending ucchaTaa to
uccitikaa. I do not know of any reference in musicologicl texts to an
instrument or a musical term called ucchaTaa.

Nadii is a metre and hence a syllabic sequence produced on the drums, as given by
Bharata Muni and Naanyadeva. It is well defined and was in currency it seems
for more than a millennium. It was used as drum sound for joy as certified by
Naanyadeva.

Uccitikaa is mentioned both by Bharata Muni and Abhinava to mean
a string of syllables or a phrase, present day term in Hindi 'bol', in
drums (pus.karavaadye) NS 31 and reiterated by Naanyadeva .

Taala is also a vaadyaprapandhah or a 'bol', says S.aarngadeva.

Vanaspati is a mystery. Yes, a melaraaga but that does not fit in here.

What is this text by the way from where your line comes ?
Does this help or is it confusion worse confounded ?
