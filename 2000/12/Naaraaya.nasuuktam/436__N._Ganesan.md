Agreed that Vishnu-Purushottama is depicted as dark colored in Indian
art, but the word that is translated as yellow is pingala, and not
purusha.

>â€‰From Online Monier-Williams:
piGgala
reddish-brown , tawny , yellow , goldcoloured AV. &c. &c , ;
(in alg. also as N. of the 10th unknown quantity) ; having
reddish-brown eyes Ka1tyS3r. Sch. ;

For piGgala, the first meanings given in Monier-Williams
and Apte is reddish-brown, and that will fit the nArAyaNasUktam
well.For example, Even though Hari means both green and yellow,
the standard color of Hari(Vishnu-Narayana) is *green-black*
or *blue-black*.
