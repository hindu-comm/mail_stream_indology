Compare tamil names like piccamuttu, kuppamuttu, kuppai/kuppu
(Mahamahopadhyaya Kuppusamisastri), maNNukkaTTi/maNNAGkaTTi (Salem/Dharmapuri),
and kannada/tamil names like sAyaNa(n).

Is -sAyi in anantasAyin, rangasAyin, vaTapatrasAyin Tamil?
Monier-Williams does not give it as Sanskrit in the meaning used here.
