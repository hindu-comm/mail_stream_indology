vaa, indeed, can have the meaning "optionally" in grammar, i.e. in
Paa.nini's A.s.taadhyaayii and the subsequent works. See, e.g., Louis
Renou: Terminologie grammaticale du sanskrit, 2nd ed., Paris 1957, p. 271,
s. v. "vaa"; K. V. Abhyankar: Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, 2nd ed.,
Baroda 1977, p. 344, s.v. "vaa". Louis Renou: "Sur le genre du suutra dans
la litt√©rature sanskrite." In: Journal Asiatique 251 (1963), p. 186.

Note, that I do not claim that "vaa" here, in the Yogasutra, means
"optionally", I just want to point out that this can be the case in
certain contexts elsewhere.
