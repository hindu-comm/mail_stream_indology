Actually, if you buy either Thomas Kuhn's or Karl Popper's philosophy of
science, science consists of models that attempt to explain (part of) the
perceived phenomeno. So, scientists can't speak of ``Truth''.

Platonism seems to be coming back in fashion, but without answering the old
objections against it. So whether science is a search for truth or not
depends on whom you ask. [But then there may be people, like mathematicians
once described as Platonists on weekdays and Formalists on Sundays, who
talk as if they are Platonists but disclaim it when asked point blank. In
fact, I belong to this group.]
