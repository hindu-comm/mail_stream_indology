The resemblances are not superficial and are not all from later
periods. See my last post for examples.

Your suggestion that there is some peculiarly "western" (as
opposed to "Indian"?) meaning of "truth" is a remnant of old
romantic ideas about the "wisdom of the East." I don't see a
great divide here.

Go back and read the Stoics or Epicureans or Daoists for many
parallels.

No comment needed.
