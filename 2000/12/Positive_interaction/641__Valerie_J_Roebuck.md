Haven't got many reference books available over the holidays, but
Monier-Williams at least seems to think that kAma (root kam-) has IE
antecedents.  He relates it among others to the Latin words comus,
"companion", and carus, "dear"--and, with loss of initial c, to the Latin
verb amo, amare, "to love", with its many popular derivatives in European
languages.

So according to his theory,"When the moon hits your eye/ Like a big pizza
pie/ It's...kAma!"

Does anyone know whether this derivation is still accepted?

Happy New Year to all--
