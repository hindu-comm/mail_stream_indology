1. FIFTH ADHYAYA-FIRST BRAHMANA which talks about "the invisible Brahman"
and "the visible Brahman"

2. FIFTH ADHYAYA-THIRD BRAHMANA which talks about the word "satyA" being
made of three syllables.  Two truths "sa" and "ya" and separated by the
untruth "ti".

Sankara's commentary may explain about the "two truths", but in any case
they must about the visible/invisible brahmans which is the topic of first
brahmana.

Bhadraiah
