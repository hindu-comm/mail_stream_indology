I see the apparent connection you draw, but could not
"Mahendra" simply have been a popular royal name for
the period? All the same, it may be of interest to
review the incident in 802 when the Hiranyadama
accompanied His Majesty King Jayavarman II and his
esteemed guru Zivakaivalya into the depths of the
moss-laden forests of *Mahendraparvata* (present-day
Mt. Kulen). It was there that the brahman "of apparent
Indian birth" satisfied the king by performing the
rites of the Devaraja so that the king would become
the cakravartin. Afterwards, Hiranyadama turned to the
king�s own guru and revealed the secrets of the
Tantric rites, even teaching him the pertinent Tantric
texts.
