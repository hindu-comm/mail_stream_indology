I agree completely with what you say about national identity issues
impairing a 20-20 view of Maldivian cultural origins, but I think you put
the above a little too strongly.  There may indeed be Tamil borrowings in
Divehi; there are certainly Malayalam ones.  But one must remember that
the basic language is Indo-Aryan, and is closest to Sinhala in grammar,
morphology, and most of its non-Islamic vocabulary.
