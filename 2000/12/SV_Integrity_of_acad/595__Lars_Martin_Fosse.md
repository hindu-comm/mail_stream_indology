The linga is most certainly a penis *originally*, and has in early art been
depicted as such. However, it is probably a long time ago that practicing
Hindus thought of it as a penis. It has long since become a powerful cosmic
symbol. You therefore have to look at historical periods when you interpret
the symbol. Kripal's critic may be in good faith, although he may be
misinformed about the early history of Shaivism. Or he may simply be busy
doing what is often done in religious circles: projecting modern ideas
backwards into the past, so that the past does not seem scandalous to
modern sensibilities. Academics are not supposed to do so, but amateurs and
theologians often do.
