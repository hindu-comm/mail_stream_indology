Listmembers, I am the author of the piece that is being discussed. Thanks
for your input. Let me clarify. I am neither misinformed about the early
history of Shaivism nor I do have any agenda similar to "what is often done
in religious circles." All that I wrote was that practicing Hindus do not
have "Shiva's penis" in mind when they worship him. Nor is there any
evidence that Hindus of ancient times thought of the penis when they
worshipped Shiva. This reality does not conflict with the theory that the
Shivalinga was a phallic symbol. It may have been, but that is NOT what a
Hindu thinks while worshipping.
        More importantly, the linga is itself a symbol of Shiva. By no stretch of
imagination can it becomes Shiva's linga or "Shiva's penis," which is what
Kripal writes in his book.
