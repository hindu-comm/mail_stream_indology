Well said. But I still believe that the other context of tantrA/Bob Peck's
experiments may equally be valid in a different context with no value
judgements attached to that approach. What if Bob comes up with a great
discovery and patents it? (All the best Bob!) Isn't it a fact that a good
percentage of any country's population needs Viagra(TM)? Why not make use of
a natural alternative with no side effects other than
liberation/emancipation?  It is the mix up of contexts by Prof Kripal that
bothers me.

Best regards
Bhadraiah
