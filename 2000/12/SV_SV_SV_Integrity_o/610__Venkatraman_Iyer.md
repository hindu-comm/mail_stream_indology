>Many sanskrit words evolved into local languages with different meanings.
>The word "kAm" means "desire" in sanskrit and Telugu, but in Hindi it means
>"work".

Hindi "kAm" is from skt. karma/pali kamma.

But skt. kAma 'desire' is possibly Dravidian, both
VishNu and his son kAman are painted black and
Tamil literature derives kAmam from the 2500 year old
TolkAppiyam sUtram: "kam niRaintu iyalum".

"kamam/kAmam" in Tamil means "filling/filled with" (desire).

Regards,
V. Iyer
