Dear listmembers,
a friend of mine has asked me to put the following question:

Is anyone aware of any comparative studies between the rituals aspect of the Buddhist Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha tantra in the Japanese and the Tibetan tradition?

We are aware of the studies by Lokesh Chandra, Snellgrove, Snodgrass, Patry Leidy, and Kiyota.

Sincerely,
Ulrich T. Kragh
