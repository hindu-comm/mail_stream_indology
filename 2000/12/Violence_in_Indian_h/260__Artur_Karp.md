Is it so clear that in the process of (what may be termed as) the Indian
internal colonization no land was ever taken  (looted, if I may use your
language) from original owners? By Indians - from Indians?


Is it so clear that no Indian tribal "religious symbols, prayer places and
altars" were ever destroyed by the builders of new cities, pilgrimage
centers, shrines, fortresses, roads, dams, irrigation systems, mines, etc.?
