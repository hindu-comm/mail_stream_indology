So the professionals on this list need to be told
what they should be doing...
what they should read..
what should delete..
what they should study..
what they should think..

If someone puts forth some views two things are done..

1) he is asked to leave the list
2) other are told not to listen to them

This is the "openness" in which our culture will
"flourish".

Very true.. there is no "threat" to our culture.

Regards,
Vikrant
