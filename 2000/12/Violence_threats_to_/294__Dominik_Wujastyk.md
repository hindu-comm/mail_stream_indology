Dear Mr Tiwary,

Your new message is intended to be insulting, and this list was not
designed for insults, but for the discussion of classical Indian culture
and language. I have issued one warning to you already, and you responded
with this new off-subject posting.

You have apparently not, in fact, left the list, so I am now cancelling
your subscription.

In the words of the currently popular TV game show, "Goodbye".
