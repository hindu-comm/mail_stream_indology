>I have collected a number of articles on cryptographic phenomena in
>India, most not specifically on Sanskrit.  I will try to put together
>a bibliography early in the new year.  Would anyone be interested in
>mounting it if I do?  Things are too bureaucratic here. There was also
>a poster put up at the World Sanskrit Conference in Turin that two
>Italian private scholars (lawyers as I recall) were looking for
>collaborators in the study of India cryptography.  I will try to dig
>up their addresses at the same time.   Ms. Anderson will please remind
>me if I'm slow about this.
