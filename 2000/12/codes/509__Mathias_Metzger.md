While collecting material for my yet to be published doctoral thesis on the
language of diplomatic correspondence in Rajasthan I have come across lots of
documents from the 17th and 18th century AD which are encoded. The codes used
show varying degrees of sophistication. I have dealt with this in a (sorry!)
yet to be published article on the scripts used in those diplomatic letters.
If you are interested feel free to contact me.

NB: The documents are NOT written in Sanskrit but in Hindi or Rajasthani

Best wishes
Mathias Metzger

PS: I'd also like to learn what Allen Thrasher has collected on that issue.
