It is a routine change in Dravidian.
It could as well be represented as cAyaNA.
Initial c- is pronounced as ch- and s-.
The latter is more common as one moves south to north.
The s- form has also been dominating the media for some time
and people have stopped applying snandhi rules in places
where the c- is supposed to double.

The phrase "kaNkalukkuc contamillai" is often pronounced
as "kaNkalukku sondhamillai" by many.
