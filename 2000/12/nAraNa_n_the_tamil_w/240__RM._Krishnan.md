Please Check "Tamil-Tamil Akaramuthali" edited by "mu. caNmukam piLLai",
published by the Tamilnadu Textbook Society in the year 1985.

There is an entry " nAlikam = erumai, kAkam, thAmarai"

Also please read the wonderful book "yA" by "aruLi" of Tanjore Tamil
University. Here, the etymology of  yA>yAl>njAl>njAL>nAL is treated
exhaustively.  This book treats many words starting with the roots related
to "dark, black" etc. It is also a pleasure hearing aruLi. His scholarship
is remarkable.

With regards,
