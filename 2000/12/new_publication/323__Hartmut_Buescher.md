Dear Jomathan Silk,

this is indeed a very wonderful book announcement. I heard already about
the festschrift to Nagao and the long process it took to produce it, when
visiting Hamburg sometimes in Spring (participating at a seminar with Prof.
Schmithausen).
The list of contributors and their topics is most interesting indeed.
Immediately, I tried to find out about the availability of the book, first
at Amazon's and then directly at the University of Hawai'i Press. While the
first offered the possibility of pre-ordering it, the latter address does
not yet seem to have any entry for the title on the search engine at all.
What would you recommend me to do to get the book as quickly as possible?

My best regards to you,

Hartmut
