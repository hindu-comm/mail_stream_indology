As usual, instead of answering questions about how Europe has
treated its own people and what is being done about it - all you
can do is indulge in sloppy sidetracking of the issue.

It is very obvious that while you are intersted in lecturing
to Indians, you do not seem to have the same standards
for your own people.

The natives no longer accept whatever nonsense some eurocentric
academic dishes out.

Let's hope that all these eurocentric criminals stop their evildoings
at once in 2001! Perhaps eurocentric prejudice will disappear then? :-) And
also Zydenbos' de-facto-racist politicising?
