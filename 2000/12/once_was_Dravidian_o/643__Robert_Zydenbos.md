Yes, all those mass murders at the hands of Norwegians, Swiss,
Poles... Belgians devastating the Indian countryside... not to
mention the Czechs and Fins. Really embarrassing.

Let's hope that all these heriditary criminals stop their evildoings at
once in 2001! Perhaps Dalitahood will disappear then? :-) And also
SS's de-facto-racist politicising? (This should be a nice final word
on this topic.)
