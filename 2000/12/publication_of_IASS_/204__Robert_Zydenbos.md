There was a bit of discussion about this on another list recently. If
you work with Linux or FreeBSD, the Acrobat writer software is not
even necessary for producing PDFs. You write your text (with
StarOffice, TeX, anything), but instead of printing it on paper you
print it to a PostScript file. With the free program "ps2pdf" this can
be converted to the PDF format.

In that other discussion, it was mentioned that also under Windows
it should be possible to generate PDF's using the LaTeX
distribution for Windows called 'MikTeX.'
