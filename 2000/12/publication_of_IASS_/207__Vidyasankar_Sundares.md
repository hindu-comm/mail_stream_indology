This is a workable solution, but remember that the .PRN format
generated by "printing to file" is a "pseudo" version of .ps,
and often creates some problems with page numbers. When viewing
the resultant file on a postscript viewer, it will allow you to
go forward one page at a time, but not backward. It will also
not allow you to jump to a particular page number. Watch out
for large file sizes too. A 200 K MS Word document can easily
be converted to a 1.5 M postscript file.
