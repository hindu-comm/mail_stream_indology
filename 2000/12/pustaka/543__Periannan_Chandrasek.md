There are a few occurrences of pottakam in the sense of an album or book
in Tamil texts.

In the Jain Tamil epic peruGkatai (dated to ca. 8th century CE:

"niRai nUl pottakam neTu maNai ERRi" (peruGkatai:1:34/yAz kai vaittatu :25)

-->"...placing the book containing  treatises filled [with knowledge] on the
long bench..."

Another occurrence in the same book is:
"pUtiyum maNNum pottakak kaTTum" (peruGkatai:1:36/cAgkiyat tAy urai: 225)

-->"...[monks with] holy ash, [holy] earth(?), and  a book-bundle"


Another Jain Tamil classic "cIvaka cintAmaNi" of about the same date as
peruGkatai has:
"piNagku nUl mArpin2an2 peritu Or pottakam" (cIvakacintAmaNi: 2009:3)
-->"...[he with] an entangled thread on  his chest, a big book..."
