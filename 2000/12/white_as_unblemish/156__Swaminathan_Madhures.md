 It is not just Tamil-speaking peoples, most Indian peoples are

Earlier words about Indology's future:
<<
 3. I acted like the messenger who came to Versailles to inform Marie
Antoinette
 while she was regaling that trouble was brewing in the heart of Paris. I am
 aware that I have inadvertently distracted you from your main focus, for which
 I apologize. For this offense, one member of this group politely asked me to
 leave. I will honor his request. - V.V.Raman, November 16, 2000

 What happened then?
