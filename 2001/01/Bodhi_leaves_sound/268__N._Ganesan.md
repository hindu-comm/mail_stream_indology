The Bodhi tree from times immemorial have been important
in Indian culture and religion. The bodhi tree leaves
make a constant noise in the forests, and these leaves
have been imitated in metal to make garlands for cattle,
waist girdles (kAnchI/mekhalA) for children, girls.

My question is whether Sanskrit or other Indian literature
compares the sound from the leaves of a living Bodhi/Asvattha tree
with a) waves (from the sea) or b) harp/lute (VeeNaa or Yaazh)
or c) bees ?

Thanks for any comments,
N. Ganesan
