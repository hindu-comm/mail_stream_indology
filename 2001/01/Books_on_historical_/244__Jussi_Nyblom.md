As for Malayalam, I have found the following books rather useful:

L. V. Ramaswami Ayyar, The evolution of Malayalam Morphology, Ernakulam,
1936 (Reprint: Thrissur: Kerala Sahitya Akademi, 1993 [distributed by
National Book Stall, Kottayam]), 185 p.

Michail S. Andronov, A Grammar of the Malayalam Language in Historical
Treatment (Beitrage zur Kenntnis sudasiatischer Sprachen und
Literaturen: 1), Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1996, 212 p. [useful also for
beginners specially interested in historical matters as it includes the
rudiments of modern Malayalam grammar]

Much remains to be done, though.

Best regards,
