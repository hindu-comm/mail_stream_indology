>4.  [...]Fragrance is indicated by the derivation from 'kammittu'
>(=fragrant) + naadu(=country) which words when compounded become
>Kannaadu.
>5.  Kannaadu, that is Kannada thus means the language of the fragrant
>country, and the epithet 'fragrant'may be considered appropriate to the
>Kannada country abounding as it does in sandal [wood] forests and

The words kannaDa/karnATaka has nothing to do etymologically
with "kammittu"=(fragrant).

Happy 2001,
