Dear Prof. Nair,

You probably got off better for not having been invited/informed.
This was the "international conference" that "unanimously" passed
a resolution to label the Gita as India's "national scripture" -
a very stupid attempt to create an illusion of a "kitAbI" religion.
The range of people associated with this "international conference"
was amazing - from Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer of Marxist sympathies
to a few contemporary Swamis with VHP sympathies. I doubt if any
sensible person would have been able to make a positive impact
upon such strange bedfellows. Not that the said "conference" has
made an impact upon anything in India, besides passing meaningless
resolutions.

Vidyasankar
