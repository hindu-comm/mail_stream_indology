I think it'd be a hard sell to insist that *low* caste
names have to come from Dr roots.

Hey, I'm not romantic about shepherds (most of them
are men :-), sheep or their woolly by-product :-) Nor
am I romantic about Skt or Dr roots :-) In fact I'm
not even romantic about etymologies ... plse look up
my post in Indology in which I had sent the url of an
interview with D Shulman. Plse review his comments on
the obsession with etymologies in the South Indian
context. I fully subscribe to his views.

Yes, I do sometimes react to posts on etymologies.
Especially when I find something far more obvious ...
as in the case of a suggested etymology yamuna <
tozunai etc

I hope you understand.
