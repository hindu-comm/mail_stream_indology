  Do we know when is the earliest representaion of KarnATa(ka)
  in Sanskrit? In Kannada inscriptions?

  You have written that KarnATaka looks like a
  "Sanskritization" of an early Kannada word.
  Are you thinking that that Kannada word is kam-nADu?
  If so, is changes from kam-naa.du to kar-naa.tu rather
  routine?

N. Ganesan
