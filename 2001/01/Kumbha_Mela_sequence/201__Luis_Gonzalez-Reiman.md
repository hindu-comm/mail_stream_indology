_______________

The sequence is:

PrayAga (Allahabad)
Nasik
Ujjain
HaridvAra (Hardwar)

It is determined astrologically, by the position of Jupiter in the "fixed"
constellations (ie. sidereal positions).

PrayAga-------- Jupiter in Taurus (with Sun and Moon in Capricorn)
Nasik------------ Jupiter in Leo (with Sun and Moon in Cancer)
Ujjain------------ Jupiter in Scorpio (when the Sun enters Libra)
Hardwar------ Jupiter in Aquarius (when the Sun enters Aries)

Jupiter has a 12-year cycle,  so it takes place in a different site every 3
years.

See Kane, History of Dharmasastra, vol. 5, pt. 1: 287.
