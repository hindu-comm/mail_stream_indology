Thank you for the reference. The official U.P. government
Kumbh Mela page at http://www.kumbhallahabad.com/
made me wonder. It looks like their sequence is

Hardwar-----------Jupiter in Aquarius (Sun and Moon in Cancer or Leo)
Allahabad---------Jupiter in Aries or Taurus (Sun and Moon in Capricorn)
Ujjain---------------Jupiter in Leo (Sun in Aries)
Nasik---------------Jupiter in Leo (Sun and Moon in Leo)

With regards,

Artur Karp
