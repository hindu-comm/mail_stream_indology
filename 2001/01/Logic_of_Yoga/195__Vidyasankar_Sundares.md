There are more than six systems of thought, but the "standard"
six darzanas are by no means static.

My intention is not to offend or to force you to "resign".
However, it seems to me that nothing much useful comes out
of conflating philosophical views of ultimate reality with
a restricted set of disciplines that may be called Indology.

Best regards,
Vidyasankar
