Bhadraiah Mallampalli,

Thank you for your grippingly lucid and obvious post.
Are you not rearticulating of the general basis of the
history of metaphysical/religious traditions, which
have always been founded on the same sort of cunning
multi-level marketing of "sacredness," "Grand Plan"
and "redemption"? Would you be going for a piece of
the general market share? Whether accurate or false,
in accordance to this model, could not "IT" or
"yajna-as-cycle" be designated by just about any thing
or term? Why the preference for sacrifice? We invite
simplification.
