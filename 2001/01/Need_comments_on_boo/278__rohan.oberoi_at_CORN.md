By all means by the book, but don't take it seriously without also
reading a few reputable works on related subjects, such as:

1. Mallory, JP, "In Search of the Indo-Europeans", 1989.

2. Erdosy, G, "Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia", 1997.

3. Deshpande, MM, and Bronkhorst, J, eds, "Aryan and Non-Aryan in
   South Asia", 1999
