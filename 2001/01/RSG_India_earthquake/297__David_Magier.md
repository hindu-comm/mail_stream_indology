Colleagues,

I am sure you have all been reading the papers on this tragedy, and
probably have also been asked by friends about where they should
contribute money.  My advice is to go to the South Asian Journalists'
Website (www.saja.org) where there is a box on the earthquite that
includes links and suggestions.
