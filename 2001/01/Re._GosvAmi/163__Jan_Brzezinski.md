Goswami was used in Bengal as a general title of
respect, originally for the wealthy (where "go" means
land, rather than cattle, but where both are
indicative of material, rather than spiritual riches).


>â€‰From there it came to be applied to spiritual leaders.
To look for Tamil roots for this usage would likely be
futile. Certainly the interpretation "go" = senses,
svami = master, therefore Goswami = "one who has
mastered the senses" seems to be a very much latter
day interpretation. It is certainly not found in the
first couple of generations of Gaudiya literature.
