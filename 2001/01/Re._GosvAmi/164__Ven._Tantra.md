<< Goswami was used in Bengal as a general title of
respect, originally for the wealthy (where "go" means
land, rather than cattle, but where both are
indicative of material, rather than spiritual
riches)... From there it came to be applied to
spiritual leaders. >>

Your interesting comments seem to imply that the
sanctifier �go,� in connection to Goswami, functions
more or less in the same way that �Maharaj� does � as
the title meant originally for literal �kings� was
applied to indicate an individual�s perceived
spiritual exaltedness � and became a title for holy
men. Earthly sovereignty has long been a metaphor for
spiritual ascension in India.
