I have also heard that students in other european countries rebelled
against the teaching of Latin. This was part of student protests in the
1960s in many countries against the Establishment. Rejecting Latin was part
of rejecting Establishment.

In India, if Establishment is to be rejected, then students will demand
sanskrit since the "secular"  Establishment in India is very anti-sanskrit.
Any idea of sanskrit  evokes images of molten lead down the ears a la Manu
