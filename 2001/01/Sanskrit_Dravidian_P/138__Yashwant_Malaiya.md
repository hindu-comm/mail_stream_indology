Is there a

- well-recognized procedure one can use to identify
  if a word is from Sanskrit or Dravidian?

- Is there somewhere a rigorously analyzed list of words
  (used in Sanskrit and/or North Indian languages) that
   have been shown to be derived from Dravidian (like kalaa
   etc. )?

I have specially been interested in finding Hindi words of
Dravidian origin.

In cases, when a word is derived from Prakrit (or Apabhramsha),
it can be harder to trace its origin. Many words in South
India must have come from Prakrits, rather than from Sanskrit
directly. The name "Kannan" in Tamilnadu, is from Prakrit KaNha,
as is "Kanhaiya" in North India.
