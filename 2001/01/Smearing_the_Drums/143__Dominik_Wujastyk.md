Chapter six in the Kalpasthana of the Susrutasamhita teaches how to make
up a caustic paste (k.saaraagada) and smear it on drums (dundhubhi),
banners, and town doorways.  Once this paste has been applied, and the
drums have been beaten loudly so that everyone can hear, any general
poisons affecting the populace will be banished.
