Chapter six in the Kalpasthana of the Susrutasamhita teaches how to make up
a caustic paste (k.saaraagada) and smear it on drums (dundhubhi), banners,
and town doorways. Once this paste has been applied, and the drums have been
beaten loudly so that everyone can hear, any general poisons affecting the
populace will be banished.
The pakhawaj is always played by smearing the bass drum head with flour
paste just like the mridangam. double headed drums are also depicted in
harappa.
