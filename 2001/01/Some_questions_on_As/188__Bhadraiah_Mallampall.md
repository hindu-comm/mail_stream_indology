If the state of a god before establishing himself/herself is defined as
asura, and the state after establishing oneself is defined as daiva, then
all the daiva-asura battles logically reduce to the battles between the pre
and post forms of the daivas. So ultimately there are neither daivas nor
asuras, which is advaita. From provisioning perspective, the physical and
mental resources of the human/animal body are limited, so the entities have
to compete with each other to minimise the usage and maximize effectiveness.
Hope this helps for now.

Why are  Prof Jeff Kripal et al still using the old Freudian Psychoanalysis
which badly needs an update?  It is time to move on to Psychophysics and
Neurolinguistics which have borrowed advanced and scientific ideas from
fields like AI.

Best Regards
Bhadraiah
