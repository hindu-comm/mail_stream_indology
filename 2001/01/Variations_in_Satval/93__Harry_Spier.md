Satvalekar at the end of each chapter of his edition of Taittiriya Samhita
has such a list that Valerie Roebuck describes.  I.e. the first word of each
paragraph of that chapter followed by what appears to be a word count for
the paragraph.

But in addition after each paragraph of the chapter Satvalekar has a list of
what appear to be variations and within the body of the paragraph numeric
references to where the variations apply.  From the example I gave in my
original posting it can be seen that most of the variations he lists are
variations in accentuation but not all.

Many thanks,
