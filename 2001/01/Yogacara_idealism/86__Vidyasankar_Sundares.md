How so? Do expand upon the following terms - "independence",
"existence", "externality", "object-ness"; and then upon the
phrase "independent existence of external objects". In what
sense does one who talks of the pramaa.nas have to accept it?
How would you disprove the statement that it is only an idea,
to think that external objects exist independently? Or do you
mean to say that only the naivest of naive realists can work
with pramaa.nas? The merest gandha-maatra of idealism would
close the door to pramaa.nas, wouldn't it?
