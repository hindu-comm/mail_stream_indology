The term asura in the Rv does NOT mean rakshas.Rather it has the same
meaning as in Avesta ( e g  Ahura Mazda).When the later meaning of Asura was
introduced is a separate question.Also, the  word  sura formed  by removing
a from asura is a later -day construct.

>Here is a rk from the Rg Veda (iv.25):
>
>"O Agni, O Asura, this ritual (yajna) of ours is full of cows, of sheep
>(aviman), of horses, of food, of offspring; may thou be always without
anger
>being in our assembly (sabhavan), a friend, like a human being
>(nvrat-sakha), possessing huge wealth and vast waters."
>
>Some questions:
>1. How is that Agni, who is one of the Gods in the Rg Veda, is being
>referred to as an "Asura" here, when we know that the term is actually used
>to refer to people in derogatory terms.
>
>2. Is there any great difference between the meanings of "Asura" and
>"rakshasa"?
>
>3. The word "aviman" (one full of sheep) is used here. Does this mean that
>the Vedic seers were raising and tending sheep at one time?
>
>4. Who exactly were the "Asuras"? [I have heard some very interesting
>theories--identifying them with the Assyrians, the Persians, the Charvakas,
>the Indus Valley inhabitants, etc.--but would like to know the recent
>opinions on this matter.]
>
>5. Is it true that the Vedic thinkers were thinking of God(s) in more human
>terms than is done today (calling the God(s) their friend, etc.)
>
>Thanking you,
>Satya
