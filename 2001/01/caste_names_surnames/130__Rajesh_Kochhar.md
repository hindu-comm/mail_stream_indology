Tendency to seek Sanskrit  or scriptural origins for all names and words should be resisted.Whole vocabulary and life style have existed beyond  the catchment area of texts.
Even where textual origins are possible, the tendency is to seek prestige-enhancing antecedents. Surely origins of all castes and caste names cannot possibly be source of pride to their current bearers. It is however rarely if ever one comes across non-flattering etymology.
