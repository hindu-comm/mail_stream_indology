>"Devil" is not related to dev-. Devil is ultimately a derivative of Ancient
Greek di치bolos, >an agent noun of diab치llein (different ablaut) "to throw
around, mislead, confuse". 
(di치 "through/around", b치llein "to >throw", related to English/German
ball/Ball). 
both roots have the same meaning?
Is  there a connection between  dev-devatA and diety. 
With the advent of christianity was there any demonization of pagan greek
gods?
