Hello,

I am interested in finding a good devanagari font for Hindi and a roman
transliteration font for Windows.  Ideally, I would be like to be able to
perform search and replace commands in Words.  Does anyone have information
on the fonts available through Linguists Software, Krishnasoft or
Saralsoft?  Krishnasoft seems to allow one to switch between roman and
devanagari without rekeyboarding.   Any information on good fonts would be
greatly appreciated.
