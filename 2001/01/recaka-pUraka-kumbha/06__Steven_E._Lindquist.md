Yajnavalkya is credited with composing the White Yajurveda and not the
Black.   BAU 6.5.3 is, I believe, the first mention of this (and also a late
part of this text). The SB has Yaj. as an authority on certain ritual
matters, but his role is quite limited.  The puranas are the earliest
detailed info. on his break from his teacher (of the Black Yajurveda, hence
he couldn't have written it), his life, etc.  He is also said to have
composed the Yajnavalkyasmriti.

Tradition views all these "Yajnavalkyas" as the same person, whereas
scholars have viewed have argued for 2, 3, etc. different people/schools.
See Renou's article on Yajnavalkya and also the work of Bronkhorst.
