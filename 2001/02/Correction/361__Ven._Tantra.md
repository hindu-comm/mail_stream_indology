In a recent post
http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0102&L=indology&D=1&O=D&P=34920
I wrongly cited Yaroslav Vassilkov as authoring a book on "The Platform
Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch."

Author and title intended are as follows:

Yamplosky, Philip B. _The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch (The Text
of the Tun-Huang Manuscript)_. New York: Columbia University Press, 1967.

Apologies,

Ven. Tantra
