Dr NG,

A side remark.

According to the MTL, 'Nakkan' seems to have had
various meanings:

1. naked person (tiruvAymozi 10.8, 12000 paDi Com.)
"ammaNamAyuLLavan tikamparanAkaiyAlE nakkanenRu pErAY"
= "the naked person is dubbed nakkan since he's a
digambara"
2. arhat (tiruviLaiyATalpurANam, pANTi. 10)
3. Siva. (tEvAram, 619,2)
This is the commonest sense of "nakkan", "nakkapirAn"
in the Vaishnava corpus also. Also, "nakkapirAntamar"
= saivites. This corpus is temporally close to
Rajaraja.
4. Ancient title of dancing girls attached to temples.
There's an epigraphic ref (SII, ii, 261) quoted in the
MTL: "ittaLi nakkan cOzakulacuntarikkup paGku onRum"
which may be translated as "one share to nakkan
cOzakulacuntari of this temple".

Hope this helps,

LS
