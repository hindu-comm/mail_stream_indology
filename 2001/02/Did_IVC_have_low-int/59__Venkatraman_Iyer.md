Kamil Zvelebil in "Companion Studies to The History of
Tamil Literature", 1992, p. 29:
"Finally, there was the level representing the elite strata: the
rulers, their minstrels and bards, priesthood, administrative
apparatus, warriors. Fundamentally, they were closely connected
with the land-owning middle section of the national culture.
Sanskritization and Brahminization of the ruling elite must
have been rather thin, not at all very strong at that period;
however, even our earliest textual evidence shows that it was
never quite absent, although there was, too, a strong influence
of Jainism/Buddhism."

George L. Hart begins his "Woman and the Sacred in Ancient
Tamilnad", JAS, XXXII, 2 with the statement:
"We possess in ancient Tamil a large body poetry which antedates
for all intents and purposes the incursion of Sanskrit culture
into Tamilnad."

Best wishes,
V. Iyer
