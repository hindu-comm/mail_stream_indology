Then how do you place which layer i.e. the date a particular line of Thol.
belongs to? If your theory is correct, then Thol. was constantly interfered
with and lines added probabaly till 7th century and Thol. as we know is a
late product

So when does the worship of Indra and Varuna with Indra vizha and other
things begin in old Tamilnadu?
