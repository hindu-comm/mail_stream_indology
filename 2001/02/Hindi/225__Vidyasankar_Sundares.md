In case you didn't know, Tilak published one newspaper in
Marathi, and another in Sanskrit. Are we talking about the
Hindi language or the Hindu religion? The two are different
things, you know.

So now Indira belonged to the Sangh Parivar too? She was not
one of my favorite people, but please cut her some slack.

Surely, India has to be the only democratic country on this
earth where it is a crime for a politician like Indira to
acknowledge the culture of the majority of its people.
