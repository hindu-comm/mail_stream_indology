Hello Dmitri,

I would suggest you take another look at the word citta, in
the terms cittAntara, paracitta etc, in the other three pAdas
of YS. "That which mind is fixed upon" presumes a mind, which
has not yet been introduced anywhere in the first few sUtras.
And similarly, also the word pratyaya. Other grammar can wait ...

Vidyasankar
