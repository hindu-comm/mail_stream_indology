>7.4.1 defines saGkalpa (we will get to vikalpa later!)as higher than manas.
>What is saGkalpa? It is a determination that "We will tackle >it when we
>come to it".

saGkalpa is translated as "will" which is also found in the sentence "We
will tackle...". (English is also good for word play! There was another good
one somewhere in Ai. Br. which says "Anointment (of kings etc) is the
ointment in the eye". More IE parallels on Vedic word play?)

I may have been harsh on "stopping the mind". If it is crudely done it can
lead to a step down to vAc (speech), but if it is done intelligently it can
lead to will.

>cittavRtti niridham is avoiding comtemplation, because it is too tiring to

Meditation (dhyAna) is possible only when the model is complete
(pUrNamadaH.. etc). The model is complete only when we consider all the
viewers, hence my original discussion re: infinite viewers.

(I appreciate if any one kindly explains the question regarding the dvandva
in YS I.7)

Best regards
Bhadraiah
