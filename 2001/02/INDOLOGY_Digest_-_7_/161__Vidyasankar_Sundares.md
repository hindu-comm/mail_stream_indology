It does. I already pointed out once to YS 2.20-21. Now I quote
YS 2.22 - k.rtaartha.m prati na.s.tam apy ana.s.ta.m tad, anya-
saadhaara.natvaat. The *tad* here is d.rzya, which would include
all "external objects". Note that I have hitherto given only YS
references, and have nowhere quoted any commentary.

Best wishes,
Vidyasankar
