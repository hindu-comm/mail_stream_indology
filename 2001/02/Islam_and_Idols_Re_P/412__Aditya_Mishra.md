Rustam Masalewala <masalewala at HOTMAIL.COM> has written as follows:
>Is destruction of idols against Islam? Or is it an essential part?
Do you consider a mosque as idol too or not?
What about the black stone in Kaaba?
I understand it was used an idol even before Mohammad's time.

>Many of the world's art treasures are now in Islamic
>countries. There will be more when more regions turn
>Islamic.
Is this  your prophecy  or desire?
