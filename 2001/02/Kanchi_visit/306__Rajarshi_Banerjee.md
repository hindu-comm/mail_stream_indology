which is probably enough to prove that she was"Hindu":

Yes she was a hindu nobody is arguing that.
Prostrating 3 hours or 20 days or if she kicked holy men around has nothing

Mr. abbas's posts are clumsy and devoid of logic. One wonders if he is realy
an ISI agent who has been given a directive of learning hindoo culture.
