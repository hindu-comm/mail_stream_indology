I think Rohan is right. It may have been like viSNu becoming buddha to play
trick on asuras and deviate them from path of vedic sacrifices(!) Indira
Gandhi may have propped up Bhindranwale to delude Sikhs and Akalis so that
she can later paint minority groups as anti-national. Hey I can create myths
too! (Aren't we getting too close to current affairs?)
