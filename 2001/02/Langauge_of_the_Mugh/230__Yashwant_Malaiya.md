The court language of the Moghuls was always farsi, right to the end.
The family language of the Moghuls was Turkic.

Many in Pakistan question use of Urdu as the national language,
and suggest the Arabic or Farsi be the national language there.

The last emperor did compose verses in Urdu, but Urdu never had
any official position during the Moghul rule.

Some Moghul courtiers  supported Hindi poets and composed Hindi
poetry themselves . Abdur Rahim Khankhana was the son of Turkmen
mentor of Mughul emperor Akbar - Bairam Khan.
