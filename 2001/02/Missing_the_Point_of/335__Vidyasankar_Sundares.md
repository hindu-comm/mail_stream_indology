The same arguments could be extended to any supposedly
historical figure from India, couldn't they? Paucity of
concrete evidence is the rule rather than the exception.

I would offer just one note of caution. Perhaps one needs
to inject a more critical attitude towards what is usually
assumed about "the Buddha", but this need not result in an
outright skepticism or even denial of the notion that a
personality called Siddhartha/Gotama lived ca. 5th century
BCE. One can be very comfortable with the notion that he
was only one among many "buddhas", as I presume you are.
I see your comments more as a criticism of how much most
academicians are willing to believe in this regard, for
whatever reason. Do you think that the majority of them
have forsaken scholarly skepticism in favor of an extreme
degree of credulity? Is the suspension of disbelief a tad
too willing? :^) Clarifications welcome.

Vidyasankar
