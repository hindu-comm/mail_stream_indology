I am ignorant of this subject and hesitate to comment.  However, there is in
the Indology archives a series of messages concerning potters, Brahmins and
Rishis.  The theory seems to be that indigenous potters were treated as
Brahmins and priests in very early times.

Question: could it be that those who trace their ancestry to a pot are
recording in that manner their early status as potters, hence their origin
as Brahmins?

Do a search for "brahmin and pot" and check the box for substring search.
