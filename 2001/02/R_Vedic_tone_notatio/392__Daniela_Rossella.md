Dearest Allen, You can write in my name to dr. Massimo Gentili-Tedeschi,
chief librarian of the Musical Academy of Milano. He is very expert and
extremely kind person. Also, he knows the most celebrated
ethnomusicologist and the sites about musicological arguments.

Love,
Daniela

(It is strange: my next essay is about the Indian characters, plots,
panoramas and stories in the Western melodrama's librettos!)
