Perhaps precisely the opposite is more the case: the number of academic
publications that follow the above distinction is rather innumerable,
whereas for non-academicians (e.g., my daughter) Hindi may be "the
language of Shahrukh Khan". In academia a certain terminology
concerning these matters has already been established (based on a
practice in the land, even if there are persons who disagree with it),
and it seems not desirable to alter it.

Now wait a minute: what I learnt in school in Canada ;-) was distinctly
more British than US-American, and Canadian dictionaries show the same.
While some newspapers follow US spelling (maybe for the ease of
spelling correction software?) and some persons do too, you will
also find those who vehemently oppose it - more because they appreciate
being distinct from Americans rather than because of 'loyalty to the
queen'.

In another message:

So the European continent is not part of the international
community, nor is the British commonwealth? Hm...
