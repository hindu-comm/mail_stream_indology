Till just a few years back German used to be written in a  font different
from the other Roman fonts which made it  harder for others to read it
fluently. You are right in that fonts don't make a language and Bengali and
Gujrati scripts can easily be  read by any one who can read Devnagri since
essentially they are variations of the same scripts. OTOH Urdu is an anomaly
created by sycophant courtiers of Moguls kings to suit the taste  of their
rulers. Subsequently several poets like Katju used it to write great poetry
which would touch the nerve of listeners who did not care the script in
which the poet himself penned it. Urdu script was designed to make it easier
to be  read by Muslim invaders who were by  that time neither conversant in
their own native language farsi nor the language of the subjects just
Macauley introduced the English language to teach the native Indian
subjects.

Have a peaceful and joyous day.

Random thought of the day:
        To vacillate or not to vacillate, that is the question ... or is it?
