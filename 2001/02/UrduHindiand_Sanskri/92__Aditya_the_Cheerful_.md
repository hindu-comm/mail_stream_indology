This seems to be your personal opinion in your attempt to discredit Kamal

I suspect that they are really fundamentalist Islamists  masquerading as
sufis since Turkey is even to this  day is the only secular country whose
population is predominantly muslim.

There were many such Islamists during his time in India who launched a
misguided movement called Khilafat. The word "Khilaf" was deliberately
misused since it means "opposition" and has nothing to do with Caliph or
Khalifa. Even Mahatma Gandhi was duped into supporting this movement which
ultimately led to a demand for separate country and resulted in the
formation of Pakistan.

Have a peaceful and joyous day.
