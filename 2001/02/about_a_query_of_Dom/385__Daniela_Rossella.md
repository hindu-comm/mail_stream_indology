I shall participate in WSC of Delhi. I am preparing
a paper about the librettos of European melodramas which have drawn
inspiration from Indian characters, myths, literary works, settings,
panoramas, historical events and so on. I have already stored about 250
titles of operas.
All the best,
Daniela
