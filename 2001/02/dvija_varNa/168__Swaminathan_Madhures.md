For all the three var.nas, except the Shudras, "dvija" (twice-born) is
applied. A good study of how this works in N. India:
The twice-born, a study of a community of high-caste Hindus,
Carstairs, G. M. (G. Morris), Indiana University Press, 1961.

Application of varNa schemes onto anything like fauna or flora:

and the origins of caste, OUP, 1994
