"L. Suresh Kumar-LSK" <lskumar at SYMPATICO.CA> has written as follows:

>1. I object to the usage of Hindee / Hindoo. This is uncalled for.
This is not the only instance of his name calling.
>2. Before anyone criticises others, please define secularism.
Samir Abbas is known through his plethora of postings  to be a bull in the
china shop and a  rabid Islamist more suited to the filth that permeates SCI
and has nothing to do with the definition of secularism.  I have not read
any of his posting to have contributed anything to the scholarly discussions
on this list.
