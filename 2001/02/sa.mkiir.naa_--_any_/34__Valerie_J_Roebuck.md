No, it is from kRR (or however you want to write *long* vocalic r), to scatter!

BTW, the English words "brother" etc are not derived from bhraatR, etc,
though they all go back to a common ancient source.  There's a very good
account of the process in T. Burrow, "The Sanskrit Language", reprint
available in the laterst MLBD Newsletter.
