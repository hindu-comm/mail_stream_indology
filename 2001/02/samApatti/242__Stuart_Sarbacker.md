Dear Scholars,

It was recently suggested to me that the term samApatti which is used
in the context of the YogasUtra is also used (in a different sense?)
in the context of "kingship."  I'm wondering if anyone here has seen
such a usage (in the kingship context) and could recommend relevant
source materials to look at to explore this further.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Best Wishes,

Stuart
