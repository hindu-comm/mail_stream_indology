Bhadraiah Mallampalli <vaidix at HOTMAIL.COM> has written as follows:

>kriSna played a dual role in mahAbhArata as a strategist and pacifist. On

Not enough information is available to say that  the demand for 5 villages
was reconciliatory and whether it was  ignored properly or improperly
without knowing the names and sizes of the villages and the total number of
villages and their sizes that would have been left for Kauravas. There is no
mention in Mahabharat  about any other conditions attached to this offer.
We have go by only what is disclosed by the Vyas since Mahabharat  is such a
marathon hodge podge of so many stories.
