Is the krishna ajinam used in vedic sacrifices refers to
the leather of an antelope? Is it used as a seating
for the sacrificial priests? Is the same deer skin
tied to yajna-upavita?

----------------

Why does Brahma/brahmins sit upon and wear a dress made
of deer skin while doing sacrifices? What kind of deer is
it?, Indian art depicts Brahma's upper garments with a black antelope.

Thanks for your help,
V. Iyer
