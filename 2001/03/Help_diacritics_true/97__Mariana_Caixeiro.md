Dear members

I went through all the privious messages related to diacritic or
transliteration fonts  for macintosh and I did not find any sugestion
for this system. Information is only available for windows.
Can I get information about how can I get a diacritics font to use with
Mac Os 9.4. ? I have a old Normyn but it is not a true type font.
Please could one of you informe me about this?


Thank you



Mariana Caixeiro
