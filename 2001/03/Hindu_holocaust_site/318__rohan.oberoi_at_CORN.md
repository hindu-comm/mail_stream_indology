This is a grandiose statement of pseudo-analysis that reveals nothing
other than your own anti-Christian, anti-Muslim paranoia.

Any dispassionate survey of war and killing among "holy book" cultures
(Christianity, Islam) and other cultures (Buddhist, Hindu, etc)
cannot but reveal that the tendency to divide people into friendly and
enemy groups, and to make that the pretext for violence, is one that
will find justification no matter what the alleged inclusivity of the
high philosophy of the cultures involved.  Just look at anti-Tamil
pogroms among the Buddhists of Sri Lanka (neither of the peoples
involved being people of a book) or the recent killing of Muslim
Madurese by animist Dyaks in Indonesia.

Please stop making this list a vehicle for your antifactual paranoias.
