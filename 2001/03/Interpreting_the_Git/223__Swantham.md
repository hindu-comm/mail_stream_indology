Dear Mr. Gupta,
D.D.Kosambi was not a mere materialist; he was a highly reputed scholar of
scientific materialism which is otherwise called dialectical and historical
materialism. His contribution to the interpretation of Indian history and
culture need not be certified by anyone. His knowledge of Sanskrit evidenced
by his critical study and edition of Nitisataka also needs no certification.
