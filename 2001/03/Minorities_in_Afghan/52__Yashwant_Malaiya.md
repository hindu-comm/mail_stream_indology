Does anyone know how many followers of minority religions are still there
in Afghanistan?

Before Talibans, there used to a thriving community of Hindu/Sikh traders
in Afghanistan, mostly Khatris. They have been present in Afghanistan and
central Asia since ancient times. Some of their clans may actually have
originated in Afghanistan or nearby region.

>â€‰From what I have read in the news, they have all fled.

At one time many religions besides Buddhism, including Zoroastrianism,
Hinduism, Manichianism and Christianity flourished in that region.  It was
certainly a major center of Buddhism once.
