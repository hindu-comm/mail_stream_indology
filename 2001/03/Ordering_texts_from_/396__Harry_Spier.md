Dear list members,

Could someone tell me how to order books from the Kashmir Series of Texts
and Studies (K.S.T.S.).  Is there a catalogue and/or list of whats still in
print.

Also in particular I'm looking for ziva dRSTi no. LIX in the series .  Are
there also other good editions of ziva dRSTi?

Many thanks,
