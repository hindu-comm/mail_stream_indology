Quoting Samar Abbas <abbas at IOPB.RES.IN>:

Is it a threat or a plea for insanity?

So, according to your/Taleban logic,
1. Taleban clocks/communication system are nine years slower than the rest
of the world
2. Talebans have real trouble in distinguishing from one kind of kafir from
another
3. Buddhists in Sri Lanka/Myanmar/Thailand can demolish any Islamic
structure in 2010 as a retaliation for the blown up Bamiyan Buddhas
4. To get a solution for Chechniyan issue, plant three powerful bombs in
Ukraine
5. Next to pass the flute-note to Indonesia, and set bonfire on Buddhist &
Hindu architectures with  reasons rooted on last century East Timor riots
