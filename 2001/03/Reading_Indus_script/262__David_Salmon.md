Oh, Professor Witzel, of course!  And they told me it was quite someone else
who used this pseudonym!  ;-)

Your review is at http://www1.shore.net/~india/ejvs/.

Dr. Mishra has a website at www.indusscript.net.  I haven't surveyed the
site yet.

This will take me over my limit for the day, I fear, depending on when they
start the clock running.  I suppose the machine would work on GMT.  But at
least it is short.  I'll send it again if it's given the chop.

David
