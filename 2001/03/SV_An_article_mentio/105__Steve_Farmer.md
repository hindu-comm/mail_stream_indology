I'm recovering from a serious accident and can't get involved
much in List discussions at present, Satya, but nota bene: All
this material (including S. Kalyanaraman's notoriously confused
web pages) is hardly news to regulars on this List. I suggest
that before you try to get anyone to discuss Kalyanaraman's
opinions on this List that you spend a few hours wading through
his labyrinthal website (best of luck!).
