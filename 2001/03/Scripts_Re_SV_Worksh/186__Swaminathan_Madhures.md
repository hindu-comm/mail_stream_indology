This is a request for info from the venerable list.

1. Is Gurmukhi script given any patronage by Punjabis?
How are the administrative affairs conducted in print?
Gurmukhi?

2. Does Marathi have a historic script? Or, is it the same
as Devanagari? If there was a switch, when?

3. Is Maithili still used by Bihar pundits?

4. What about Kashmir? Is it made into Devanagari script now?
Urdu or Sarada?

Thanks.
