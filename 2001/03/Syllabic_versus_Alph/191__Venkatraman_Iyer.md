True, the nagari script is syllabaries, M. Deshpande's Sanskrit
book has several pages running to encompass all consonant-clusters
of Sanskrit in nagari. But, Harvard-Kyoto system used here
or with diacritics in academic printed works is simpler.

Because vedas and Panini preceded Ashoka, and the syllabaries
in grammars formed due to oral memory traditions, brahmi
is syllabic too. But around 150 AD only we have Skt. inscriptions.
Prof. Witzel wrote about some short ones in Mathura little earlier.

Vietnam and regions near it have much earlier inscriptions
employing South Indian grantham letters. Grantham was due to
Pallavan rule.
