It may be that most posters have taken de Jong's criticism of
Przyluski's later work to heart.[1] Apparently ...

 In later publications Przyluski succumbed to a mania of
 comparatism which led him to discover everywhere non-Indian
 influences.

This sounds like a disturbing condition. One really wouldn't want
to spend much time with someone who had developed it. 8-)

in Europe and America' (Delhi: Sri Satguru, 1987)
