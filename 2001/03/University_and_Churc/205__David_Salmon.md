Dear Prof. Fosse,

I enjoy (most) European "teasing" of Americans, but I had you dead to
rights.  Can't let an opportunity like that pass.  ;-)

It would appear, thanks to the remarkable erudition on this list, that we
were both wrong, since Hebrew as God's tongue has obviously  had respectable
Christian support.  Can't get much more pre-certified-orthodox than
Augustine, I suppose.  Thankfully, the idea has not survived into modern
times, though 1955 is a little too close for comfort.

Regards,

David
