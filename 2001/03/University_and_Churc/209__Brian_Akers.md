I just got back from vacation and am slowly going through my e-mail.

A few years ago two of my aunts came to visit for a few days. I fielded the
inevitable question of "What exactly is Sanskrit and why do you study it?"

In the course of the following discussion, the eldest aunt (over 80 years
old) expressed the belief that if a child grew up without being taught a
language, he or she would speak Hebrew by default.

I assume one can attribute this belief to the one-room schools or small
churches of rural Wisconsin in the 1920s and 30s.

All the best,

Brian
