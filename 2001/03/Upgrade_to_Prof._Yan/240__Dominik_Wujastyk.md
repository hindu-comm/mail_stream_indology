Prof. Yano's extraordinarily useful and sophisticated web-based tool for
calculating various Indian eras and dates is located at

        http://www.kyoto-su.ac.jp/~yanom/pancanga/index.html

Prof. Yano has written to announce an upgrade to the program, and he has
most generously made his algorithms publicly available.

Subject: pancanga

Dear Dominik,

I have been working for upgrading the Perl version of pancanga
program.

There are several new features as you will see.

I have decided to make the source script of the perl version
open to the public.

[...]
I will appreciate if you announce about our new version.

With best wishes,
