In case you are unaware of this: Yahoo, by default, allows group
moderators to add Yahoo members without permission to their groups.
If you don't want this to happen, you need to go to "My Preferences"
and edit it so as to disable this.

[Members of the Indo-Iranian group, or some others which were part of
egroups may have become part of Yahoo groups when the two merged. And
they may not aware of this bizarre policy of Yahoo.]
