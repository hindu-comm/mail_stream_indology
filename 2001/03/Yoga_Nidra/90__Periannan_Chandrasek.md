The classical Tamil text cilappatikAram (pre-Kalidasa?) mentions
"aRi tuyil" ("conscious" sleep) or yoga nidra of viSNu at ATakamATam
(thought to be Thiruvanantapuram's  Padmanabhaswamy Temple)
"ATakamATattu aRituyil amarntOn2" (cilapp: 26:62)

Translation by R. Parthasarathy, "The Cilappatikaram of Ilanko Atikal",
