Thanks to Rajesh Kochhar and Ravi Chaudhary for their sane and constructive
comments.  Any suggestions about the form such a communication should take?

>May I suggest we focus our attention and energies on the problem at hand.
>More specifically,can we do some thing to save the Bamiyan heritage? If

Ravi Chaudhary:

>Art and the appreciation for art, transcends all cultures, is universal.

>The question to be addressed is what can be done if anything?
