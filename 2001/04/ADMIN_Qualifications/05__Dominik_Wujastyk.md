To all INDOLOGY members

If classical Indian studies are not your field of professional endeavour,
then please reconsider whether this is the right forum for you.

See the guidelines governing INDOLOGY's content, at
        http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/indology0.html

If you do not subscribe to the main indological journals, attend
indological conferences, or hold a professional appointment in some aspect
of classical Indian studies, please do not post messages to this list.

I shall be tightening up on this policy.  There are plenty of other
internet forums for the general discussion of Indian matters; and if you
do not find one that meets your needs, it is a simple matter to start a
group of your own at yahoogroups.  This particular INDOLOGY list was
formed for universtiy academics in Indian studies, and non-professionals
should not participate in this discussion list.
