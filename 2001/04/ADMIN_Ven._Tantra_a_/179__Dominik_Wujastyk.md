Ven Tantra has now written to me suggesting that I misunderstood his
statement about this topic.  As members will know, VT likes to adopt an
allusive and oblique style of writing, so I may have misunderstood his
intentions.  At the moment I still don't know, but I have asked for
clarification.

Does anyone on the list know Ven. Tantra personally; have you met him?
