Having an "ego" is simply a condition of being human (particularly for an
academic, whether Indian, German, American, etc.).  Letting the village
idiot (Mr. Bhatta and others) speak is a condition of democracy.  Responding
to such nonsense, however, wastes bandwidth and only makes the writer feel
vindicated.

S. Farmer may not be a specialist, but he has added more to the quality of
this list than others.  I only wish others here were that "unqualified."
