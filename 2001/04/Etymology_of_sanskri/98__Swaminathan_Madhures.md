I read in R.M.W. Dixon, The rise and fall of languages, CambridgeUP
that the Nostratic theory of linking distinct language families is
not accepted by any historical linguist. Is it so?

Also, not just words, but in building common grammar between
two different language families, Nostratics fails badly.

Seeking the scholars' guidance to know the status of Nastratics,
say in linking Tamil and Greek, (or) TuLu and English.

Sincerely,
SM
