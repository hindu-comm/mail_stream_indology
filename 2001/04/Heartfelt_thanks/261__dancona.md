Dear Dominik,

My profound thanks to you and the learned contributors to this 

list. It has been my daily joy and sustenance for some years now. I 

understand your position having monitored a list on Ayurveda 

myself but, my heart for one will jump for joy, should you 

reconsider or find a way to keep the list alive. Many blessings in 

any case.

Hari Om!

Swami Shivananda Sarasvati D.Ay.
