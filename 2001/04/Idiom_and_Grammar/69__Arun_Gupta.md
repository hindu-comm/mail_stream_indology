Contrary to Shri Venkatraman Iyer, I see the proliferation of
amateur histories as a direct result of the fact that no
professional historians, Indian or non-Indian, are making 20th
century history available to the general public in India.

For instance, I doubt that Professor Witzel would have ever written
a popular article, such as that in Frontline, except that he was
severely provoked by such works.

If it takes such provocation to draw Indologists out of their shells,
I am all for it :-)
