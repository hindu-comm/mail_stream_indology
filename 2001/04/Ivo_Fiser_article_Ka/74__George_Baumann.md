Dear Mr. Cahill,

In regard to your request for an article by Ivo Fiser on the text
history of the Kamasutra I know only of the following one:
Paali vinaya and Sanskrit kaama-shaastra in the Festschrift Anthony
Kennedy Warder. This has been published in the collected essays
entitled South Asian Studies Papers = Studies in Buddhism, vol.
5(1993). The article is on pp 57-65.
Perhaps this might be what you are looking for.

Regards,

George Baumann
