Dear Dominik Wujastyk,
I am sorry to be using the incorrect procedure to temporarily be off the indology list, but unfortunately I do not know the correct procedure. I am going away for a couple of months and thought I should come off the list for this period. Please let me know how to join and how to temporarily be off the list - if you allow that.
I am not knowledgeable about electronic communication, hence this e-mail to you.
Please excuse me for troubling you.
Regards,
Romila Thapar
