I hope people see the bloated "ego" (as big as an Ivy League prof's can get)
of Dr. Witzel here admitting that he has learnt a lot quantitatively and
qualitatively from someone who  has just come under fire for not being expert
in Witzel's area.

If that is ego for some folks, we would like to  see more of it!

P. Chandrasekaran.
