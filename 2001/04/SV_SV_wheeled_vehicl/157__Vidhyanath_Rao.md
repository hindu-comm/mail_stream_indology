Ohh, a chariot that runs through woods/tall grass of the wild.
I just have to have it. Where can I get one?

BTW, I am still waiting for someone to demonstrate that a
harnessing system [as reconstructed by Sparreboom for the Vedic
chariot] consisting of a yoke placed on the withers, and
two straps, one around the neck and the other just inside the legs,
holding it down is in fact functional. Otherwise, we can only conclude
that the Vedic chariot is indeed just like Kalidasa's chariot or
the puSpaka vimaana of Kubera.
