Subrahmanya wrote of euro-supremacist writing of the OIT.
:
Cannot the OIT concept be supported by the spread out of India of very
fundamental religious definitions and practices? Namely, the presence of
an inner power within the heart that can be released producing heaven
.
The modern interpretation of those terms has varied considerably in India as
well as in the West when the interpretations were obviously shifted to point
to an external controlling spirit from a heaven above and heart became
cardia instead of center. (Christian influence?)
