Iconoclasm in classical and medieval India *is* an appropriate topic!
Duh.

Actually, many important studies of this topic already exist, by Schwab,
Inden, Breckenridge and van der Veer, Trautmann, and others.  These
authors are all natives, of course.

Yes, I do.  So I insist that a discussion of the Taliban, their
motivation, our feelings about what has happened, and so forth, is
inappropriate in this forum.  I urge you in the strongest possible terms
to discuss this vitally important topic.  But please do so in an
appropriate forum, e.g., one designed for current affairs.  Not in
INDOLOGY.

Yes, it is valid.  The INDOLOGY forum is designed for the open-minded,
scholarly discussion of any topic that falls within its defined scope,
which is clearly stated in the documentation available at
www.indology.org.uk

A fashion magazine could justifiably turn down submissions on engineering;
a physics journal could even turn down submissions on chemistry.  The
INDOLOGY forum deprecates submissions on current affairs.  It's a simple
matter to grasp, surely?
