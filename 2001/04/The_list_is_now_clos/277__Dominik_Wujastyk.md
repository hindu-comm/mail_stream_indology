Please do not post further messages to indology at liverpool.ac.uk, since the
list is now closed.

Please do not send queries or complaints to the list managers at
the University of Liverpool.

I am sending out invitations in batches of 50 per day to all INDOLOGY
members to join the new indology at yahoogroups.com   If you don't want to
wait for your invitation, you can go directly to

        http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/indology

and register and subscribe from there.

Many thanks,
