I tried reading these egroup messages, but no success.
Because there are so many egroups nowadays, it's hard to be
a member of every one of them. Would the list owner open
it up for the public? Like Indology list or
Agathiyar list discussing Tamil matters
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agathiyar/messages

If indictraditions and indiancivilization egroups become public,
it may attract even more populace.

Regards,
SM
