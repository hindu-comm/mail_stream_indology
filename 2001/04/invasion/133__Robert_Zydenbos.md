Dominik,

That book is not so very new. One chapter in it is about me (or rather:
Elst's vision of me, inspired by what I had written years back in the
Indian Express in response to a piece by N.S. Rajaram) and led to an
exchange of messages here in September 1999, in which Dr. Elst
persisted in perpetuating a lie and twisting my writing beyond
recognition, meanwhile making a few more gaffes and then bowing out
with feigned indignation. The whole episode is packaged at two places:

Rohan Oberoi's brief analysis of how the 'AIT debate' 'continues' is
quite accurate. I have also posted a rather explicit example of how
the phoney debate is used for propagating very modern political views:
