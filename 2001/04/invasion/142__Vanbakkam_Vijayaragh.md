Please refer to
 http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-shl/WA.EXE?A2=ind9409&L=indology&P=R1090
where the poster says
".  Whether the languages and cultures current in Northern South Asia
when the "Aryans" arrived were "Dravidian" is a theory that has been
suggested, but not proved, I do not think.

But I would be glad to be corrected,
