Dear list:

I am told that I missed the identification of the shloka beginning tyaja
djarmamadharmaM ca, that was sent in to the list recently.  I didn't
recognise the subject header, thought no one had responded.  Can anyone
dredge up that post and forward it to me?  Thanks much to whoever sent it.

P. Ernest
