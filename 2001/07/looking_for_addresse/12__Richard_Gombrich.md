Dear Johannes,  Natalya Isayeva is still based in Moscow but she is about
to come to London for ten months (arriving 10 August). Her address in
London:
                Flat 3,
                105 Stapleton Hall Road,
                London N4 4 RH.
        email in London: n.isaeva at virgin.net
She is a close friend of mine and can probably always be reached via me.
                                                                Yours, Richard
