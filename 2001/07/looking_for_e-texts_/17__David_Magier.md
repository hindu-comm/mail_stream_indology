I did a keyword search on "vedanta" in The International Directory of
South Asia Scholars and found many people you might get in touch with,
with full contact details and descriptions of their work. To do this
search, go on the web to the Directory at:

http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/indiv/southasia/cuvl/directory.html

and just type vedanta into the SEARCH IDSAS box.

Best,
