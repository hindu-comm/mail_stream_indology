Dear colleagues,

Perhaps it might interested you that two years ago a conference on some
topics, which Sh. Pollock raised, was held at the University of
Heidelberg (I should have invited him!). (details:
www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/IND/index.htm, click "Konferenzen" in the
German version). The conference was dedicated to Pt. P. Aithal who
represents a generation of Sanskrit learning which is hard to replace.
But this does not necessarily mean the death of Sanskrit.
 I  attach the list of papes which are (with, in some cases, slightly
different titles, some additions and other variations) in press with
Manohar Publications and should be relased within this year.
As regards the death of Sanskrit in Nepal, I rememeber a draft article of
Michaels Witzel on the situation of Sanskrit learning in this Himalayan
kingdom. However, as far as I know that study has never been published.
Mahes Raj Pant, presently Lepzig (?), had also published a book on the
same subject.

Best wishes
Axel Michaels
