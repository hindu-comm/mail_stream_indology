Dear colleagues,
        I need information on chemical composition of Indian bronze
(percentage of copper, tin and other metals) preferably in VI-V centuries B.C.
Could anybody give me a reference or a hint?
        Many thanks in advance,
                                                Yaroslav Vassilkov
