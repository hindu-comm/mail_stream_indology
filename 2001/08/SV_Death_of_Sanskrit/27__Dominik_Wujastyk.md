To what extent is it possible to do some demographics on this issue?  At
least some part of this topic can surely be grasped quantitatively.

How many Sanskrit-functioning pandits were active in, say 1600?  1700?
1900?  Where would we look for statistics?

I think there is probably some mileage in counting manuscripts too, in
various interesting ways.  (By work, by author, by repository, etc.)
