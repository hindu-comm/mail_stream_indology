Recently I saw a reference to a book (collected articles?) by Trubachov,
titled INDOARICA IN THE NORTH BLACK SEA REGION, published by Nauka
(Moscow?) in 1999.  Has anyone seen this book?  Is it in English or
Russian?  Our university library at Michigan does not have this book.  Any
suggestions on how to get hold of this book will be welcome.  Thanks.
