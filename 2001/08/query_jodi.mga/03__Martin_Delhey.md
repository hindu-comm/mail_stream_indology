In  the Abhisamayaala.mkaaraalokaa the compound
'srotriyajotinganairgh.r.nyavat seems to occur (Wogihara's edition 145: 17).
I have found this reference in Keira's and Ueda's Sanskrit Word-Index (Tokyo
1998) to this work. I don't have the edition at hand. Therefore I can't say
anything about the context.

Best regards,
