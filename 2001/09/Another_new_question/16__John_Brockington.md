I am not sure whether this is quite the shape that you are describing but
there is a fine example of an amulet case showing Hellenistic influence
found in the Gandhara area in the British Museum (a slide of it that I
bought some years ago is numbered OA 77).  This is an octagonal piece in
section (like a short piece of octagonal pencil) with two rings set at right
angles to the main axis near each end;  is is made of gold set with garnets
and dated 2nd-3rd cent. A.D.
