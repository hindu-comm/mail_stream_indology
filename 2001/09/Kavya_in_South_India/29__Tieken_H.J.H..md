Dear Professor Hart,

Having read your response to the publication of my book Kavya in South
India, I decided to write to you to let you know that I would be interested
in exchanging opinions with you on Old Tamil Cankam literature, perhaps in
the form of a guest lecture at Berkeley.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,
