My apologies for a rather late response to this enquiry (I was away at the
2nd Kraków Conference on Indian Studies till Monday evening).

There is a relevant article by Mislav Jezic [z with hacek, c with accent]:
"Parmenides and Uddalaka" in Synthesis Philosophica 14.2, 1992, pp. 427-440
(the journal is published by the Croatian Philosophical Society).
