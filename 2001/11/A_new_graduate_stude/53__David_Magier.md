Madhav,
as of this morning the URL below is non-existent. I find that there
is a Muktabodha Indologhical Research Institute website (which gives
their address in Hurleyville, NY, not in NJ) at:

http://www.siddhayoga.org/projects_support/muktabodha/

Best,
David Magier

>This morning I received in the mail a flyer from the Muktabodha Indological
>Research Institute in New Jersey.  It announces $10,000 per student
>fellowships for graduate students undertaking their dissertation research.
>One can find out more from the website of this foundation:
>www.muktabodha.org, or email them at info at muktabodha.org
>
>Please do not contact me.  I have no connection with this organization,
>except receiving their mailing.  Best,
