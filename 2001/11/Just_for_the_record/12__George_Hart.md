Thank you, Prof. Gruenendahl, for your words -- as I said, some of
the things I wrote were injudicious.

On another note, I have discovered that V. Narayanarao and D. Shulman
are publishing an anthology of premodern Telugu literature (OUP India
and U. of Wisconsin Press).  This promises to be an important book.
