Dear Colleagues,

we would like to announce the web-based presentation of a religious map
of Varanasi. The project was carried out as part of the Varanasi
Research Project "Visualized Space" at the South Asia Institute,
University of Heidelberg:

Kailâsanâtha Sukula's Mirror of Kâshî (Kâshîdarpana, 1876). A historical

map of Vârânasî based on the Kâshîkhanda and related texts. University
of Heidelberg  South Asia Institute 2001. Jörg Gengnagel (editor) &
Axel Michaels (editor-in-chief). URL: http://benares.uni-hd.de

The site will be constantly updated. We look forward to your comments
and suggestions.

Best wishes

Joerg Gengnagel
Axel Michaels
