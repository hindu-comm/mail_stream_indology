Professor Bernhard Kölver passed away on Tuesday in Leipzig aged only
62.

Professor Kölver was Professor of Indology from 1976 until 1993 at  the
University of Kiel (Germany)
before moving to Leipzig University. He was a brilliant indological
scholar and one of the leading experts
on historical research on Nepal. (A proper obituary will follow.)

His untimely death is deeply regretted by all those who knew him.
