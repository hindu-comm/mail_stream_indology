It is conventional for Tamil works to begin with an avai aTakkam -- humility
before the court (avai < sabhaa).  The greatest such poem ever written --
even better in my opinion than Kalidasa's great stanza (kva
suuryaprabhavo....) is at the beginning of the Kamparamayanam (12th
century), in which the poet compares himself, about to tell the story of
Rama, to a cat that is delusional enough to think it can lick up the great
ocean of milk.  One can surmise that the purpose of this was to avoid the
evil eye.  The exact opposite is found in the beginning of the
Rasagangadhara, where Jagannatha praises himself extravagantly.  I remember
remarking on that to my Sanskrit teacher, Seshadrinathan, who merely
replied, "sthaane."  G. Hart
