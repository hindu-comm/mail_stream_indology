Dear colleagues,
In a message of some days ago mention was made of an article by B.G.L. Swamy
about the date of the Tolkappiyam. The only other publication of that
scholar with which I am familiar is an article on Tamil Shaiva Bhakti
poetry. As I have tried to show in my book Kavya in South India. Old Tamil
Cankam Poetry (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2001) his handling of the evidence
concerning the -late- date of Tamil Bhakti poetry is exemplary. Francois
Gros' characterization of Dr. B.G.L. Swamy as an iconoclast is undeserved.
Can anyone provide me with more information about this unique scholar.
