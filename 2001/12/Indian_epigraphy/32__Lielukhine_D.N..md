Dear colleagues !

Site http://indepigr.narod.ru/index1.htm  updated. Here I placed my earlier
publication of Licchavi's inscriptions from Nepal (from the www.Orient.ru.)
Be sure, download new version of ttf-font before. All your opinions (as
about this publication, as about usualness of this type publications),
remarks, advices and recommendations will be helpful and very interesting
for me.
