Hi Madhav!

I guess we may meet in March at Stanford and I look forward to it.

As regards the Classics student at Michigan - I am sure (s)he knows
Kurylowicz. I believe (without checking) that there may also be something
to be found in some of the earlier monographs of Jan Gonda.

I in turn am interested to learn where we find that Greeks looked upon
Persians as feminine.

best wishes,

Frits
