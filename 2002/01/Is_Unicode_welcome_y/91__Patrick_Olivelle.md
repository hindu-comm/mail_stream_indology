The diacritics did not appear on my MAC Eurodora 5 e-mail.



>Dear List,

>since all the major operating systems and email clients have come to

>messages with proper diacritics (instead of Harvard-Kyoto
>"transliteration") might be welcome on this list, or in other words,
>how many of the participants do not yet use software supporting it.
>As a test, here's the half-"sloka of my last post in proper Unicode
>encoding:

>    na¯sty udyamasamo bandhu? kurva¯?o na¯vasi¯dati

>I realise that this is a touchy subject, and that some out there even
