For the record: the diacritics miraculously and by themselves appeared 
correctly in my email client KMail 1.2, running under SuSE Linux 7.2. 
But others evidently still have problems (and although I can read those 
signs, I do not know how to produce them if I would want to).

Perhaps the experiment has given the list members something to think 
about and to try out, and we can bring up the subject again in a few 
months?
