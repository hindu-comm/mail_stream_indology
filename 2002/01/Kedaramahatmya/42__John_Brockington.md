Dear Colleagues,

I am interested (on behalf of a student) in discovering possible textual
sources on Kedarnath.  I have so far found information that there is a
KedAraMAhAtmya in the VAyu PurANa and another in a Kashmiri work, the
BhRGgIZasaMhitA, though without any further details as yet.  Any further
information on these or any other possibly relevant texts (including
mentions in more general texts on pilgrimage) would be much appreciated.

Yours

John Brockington
