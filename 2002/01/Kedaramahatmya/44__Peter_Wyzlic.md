In our library we have an edition (with translation) of
BhRGgIZasaMhitA that contains two or three chapters (patala) called
kedaramahatmya. I.e.

        BhRGgIzasaMhitA : bhASA-TIkA = The Bhrngisasamhita /
        [Ed.:] AnantaRama ZAstrI. - Delhi : Nag Publishers,
        1986. - 12, 484 S.

On p. 231-238 there is (acc. to the colophon): ZrIsaMhitAyAM
kedAramAhAtmye svacchandamAhAtmyaM nAma tRtIyaH paTalaH; on the
following pages 239-242 is: ZrIsaMhitAyAM varAhamUle
kedAramAhAtmyaM nAmaM caturthaH paTalaH; and then on p.
243-250: ZrIsaMhitAyAM bhairavaviSaye kedAramAhAtmyaM nAma
paTalaH. There may be more in it but I have made only a superficial
glance on the work.

Hope it helps
