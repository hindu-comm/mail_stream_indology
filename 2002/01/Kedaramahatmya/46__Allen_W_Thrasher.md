John,

 The Kedaramahatmya is part of the Kedarakhanda of the Skandhapurana.
I am forwarding to you off the web LC's 10 records for both these titles
and also 3 records on the Bhrngisasamhita.  LC has microfiched several
of these and the fiche may be purchased from its Photoduplication
service, the copyright having lapsed.  On the other hand these eds. are
from Laksmivenkatesvara Press and Srivenkatesvara Press and may still be
available in print from the publishers or from Indian
bookseller-distributors.  The titles may be searched in LC's online
catalog at www.loc.gov/catalog.  A search by the name of the pilgrimage
sites is pretty likely to locate a number of texts, as will the subject
heading Hindu pilgrims and pilgrimages.

Allen
