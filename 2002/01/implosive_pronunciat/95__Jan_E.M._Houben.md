sit-dham:
Michael Witzel's excellent contribution to the issue
raised by Madhav leaves me with the question whether
his and Lubotsky's "implosive" pronunciation are
literally implosive in the sense that "on release of
the obstruent, there is a tendency for an ingressive
[rather then egressive, JH] airstream to develop"
(Peter F. MacNeilage on articulatory phonetics in the
International Encycl of Linguistics, 1992). From the
descriptions and context one rather expects simply
"non-plosive" pronunciation (try to say English "it"
without following "plosive").
