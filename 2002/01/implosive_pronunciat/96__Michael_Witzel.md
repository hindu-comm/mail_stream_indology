Jan is right:

phoneticists have further developed the terminology.

I got/get flak, from the Africanists/Hamito-Semiticists [Afro-Asianists],
if I use 'implosive' which they understand as "ingressive".

However, I simply use the traditional Avestan/South Asian terms. There is
some infighting going on whether Munda (or Khmer for that matter) has
ingressives. I don't think so. They are of the quality of English "yepp"
for "yes", thus plosives without the release (explosion), i.e. non-plosives.
