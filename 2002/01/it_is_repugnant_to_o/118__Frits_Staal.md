(SINCE THIS IS WRITTEN FOR INTERNAL CONSUMPTION, NOT PUBLICATION, I NEVER
BOTHER ABOUT DIACRITICS OR OTHER DEVICES OF WHICH EVEN THE MERE DISCUSSION
TAKES UP MUCH OF OUR TIME)

There are 64 anacarams among Nambudiri brahmans. They don't refer to Nayars
but one of them says "The eldest son alone should marry" (this relationship
is called vivaha and requires a(n abbreviated) Vedic ritual; the
relationship with Nayars is called sambandha).

Outside the Malayalam sources that are inaccessible to me, the Kerala
anacarams are most easily accessible in: L.K.Anantha Krishna Iyer, The
Cochin Tribes and Castes, 1912, vol.II, pp.262-266. There are a few
characteristic (of Tamil brahmans, that is) comments, e.g.  to bathe naked
(anacaram #2) "is repugnant to other brahmans".

Ananta Krishna also describes numerous other irregularities pertaining to
the Nambudiri caste.

I have never heard of an acarya commenting adversely on these anacarams. On
the contrary, they are generally attributed to Adisankara!
