I would fully support the praise of PDF. For sending out documents as
well as for homepages this seems at the moment the best
solution. Since I use TeX, on my system the documents are transformed
within seconds by typing ps2pdf x.ps y.pdf, but for others this may
not be as simple. And since you are mentioning WordPerfect, which
expecially in its antique versions is fairly wide spread among
Sanskritists, I wonder whether it is as simple for them to produce
pdf-documents.
In fact it would be quite helpful to point out if and how this works
with older WP-versions!

Greetings
