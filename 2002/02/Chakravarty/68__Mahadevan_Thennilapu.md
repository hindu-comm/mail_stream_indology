The noted Gayatri Spivak Chakravarti regrets in a recent New York Times
profile that she was born a Brahmin: so Chakravartis must be all Brahmins.
But she also consoles herself, and presumably her following, that as a
Chakravarti she is of an "inferior cast".  There is no explanation for
inferiority, however; nor is it clear if other Chakravartis would share her
pride of inferiority.

T. P. Mahadevan
