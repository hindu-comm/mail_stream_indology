This generalisation is not correct. In Bengal and Assam there are many
brahmins named Chakravarti / Chakrabarti / Chakraborti; but on the other
hand there was a famous Jaina scholar from Tamilnadu a few decades ago
named A. Chakravarti, and he belonged to the Nayanar caste, i.e., very 'low'
according to brahmins.
