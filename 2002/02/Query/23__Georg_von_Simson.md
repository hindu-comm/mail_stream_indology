yonyA- may be a "hybrid" extension of the stem yonI; cf. Edgerton,
Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary 10.6: "... such stems are made to
end in -yA, keeping feminine gender; see Dict. s.vv. zriyA, striyA (=
zrI, strI); HiraNyavatI (-tyA); these may be Sanskritizations of
Middelindic forms."

>Friends:

>I have a question about a reading in Manu 11.58 (or 57 in some
>editions). All editions read the paada-a as: retaHsekaH svayoniiSu.
>This is, of course, the grammatically correct reading. But most of my
>manuscripts -- especially the important southern manuscripts in
>Grantha, Telugu, and Malayalam scripts -- read svayonyaasu [sometimes
>svayonaasu]. Can you account for the form -yonyaasu? Have you seen it
>elsewhere? It is not recorded in the dictionaries. Thanks for your
>help.
