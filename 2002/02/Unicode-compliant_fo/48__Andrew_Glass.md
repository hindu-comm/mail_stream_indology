I know of two Unicode compliant fonts for transliterating Sanskrit.

The first is a unicode version of a font that I created with the help of
John Smith. It is available from the following site, and includes a keyboard
template for use with Microsoft Word. This font was created in order to be
able to transliterate Gandhari, but also includes the necessary diacritics
for Sanskrit, and many other languages.

The second is being developed by the Titus Project. This font aims at a much
more comprehensive coverage of unicode code points.
