Dear friends,
does anyone know the whereabouts or preferably an
email address of V.S. Rajam (author of, among
other things, A Comparative Study of Two Ancient
Indian Grammatical Traditions, and 10 years later
-- I think it's the same person -- a Reference
Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry)?
Thanks, Jan Houben
