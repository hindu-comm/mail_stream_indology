Juilia,

Just a quick comment. My impression was that the translation by
'goose' was unacceptable at one time because of the connotations to
ordinary people in England (and perhaps elsewhere) of the word goose:
'the silly goose', etc. You simply couldn't use the word in
translating a poetic context. I don't think this necessarily meant
that people thought the ha.msa was a swan. They just avoided the
rendering 'goose' because at that time it would make Indian
literature appear ridiculous to the ordinary English reader. (Some
people nowadays would have a rather different impression of geese due
to wild-life programs, etc.)
