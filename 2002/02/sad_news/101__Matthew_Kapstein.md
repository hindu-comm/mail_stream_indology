With profound regrets, I forward the following
announcement from the Dean's Office of the
University of Chicago Humanities
Division
to the subscribers to the Indology list.
Matthew Kapstein

>         It is my sad duty to inform you that Norman Cutler, Chair and
> Associate Professor of South Asian Languages and Civilizations and in
the
> College, died in the night of February 26-27, presumably from
> complications of kidney disease.  We will greatly miss his gentle
spirit,
> his dedication to this Division and University, and his exemplary
> devotion to his chosen discipline and his fortunate students of Tamil.
> Please join me in a moment of silent reflection to honor his memory.
