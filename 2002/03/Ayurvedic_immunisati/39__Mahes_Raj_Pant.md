Dear List Members
These days I am working on Nepalese administrative documents directing
vaidya-s to immune the people aginst smallpox. Can you tell me where one can
find a description of the Ayurvedic method of immunisation against smallpox?
In addition, can you suggest an authentic publication on the deification of
dead Combodian kings? I have collected parallel references from Nepalese
inscriptions.

Mahes Raj Pant
