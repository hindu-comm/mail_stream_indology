A change from .s to kh looks rather dramatic if we take kh as an
aspirated occlusive. But is it not probable that the letter kh was
used to write either a palatal or a velar fricative (spirant) (like
in German ich or ach), a sound that would be near to the
correspondant sibilant (which is also a spirant)? The transition to
the aspirated occlusive might be a rather late phenomenon, supported
by the script. Of course, this would presuppose that writing plays a
part somewhere in the process ...

But this is in so far different as the sibilant here is assimilated
to a precedent occlusive.
