Dear list-members,

The following digital texts are downloadable from
http://tiger.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/mtokunag/skt_texts/

1. The Suuryasiddhaanta, digitized by Prof. Michio Yano, quality good.
2. The Kaamasuutra, digitized by Ms. Mizue Sugita, quality good.
3. The Udaanavarga for word-search (Bernhard ed.), digitized by
M. Tokunaga, quality mediocre.

The download site has moved from my server to that of the Graduate
