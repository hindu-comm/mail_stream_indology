Ashok Aklujkar's answer to Vassilkov question about mu;nja is most helpful
and surely on the right track. The statement that the plant could be 3
merers high could be an (unconscious?) translation from Monier Williams who
mentions 10 feet. But both MW and Apte/Gode/Karve are confusing. Perhaps
the confusion is old for ritualists are not botanists and Apastamba Srauta
Sutra  10.9.13 (further references in Caland's note) states that the
Yajamana is tied with mu;nja OR ;sara. In the Agnicayana, he is tied with a
;sikhyapaa;sa to the ukhaa pot (Baudh.SS 10.14 and 15). I mention this
because Vassilkobv asked for an illustration and that string, which seems
to be made of mu;nja or ;sara, is depicted in AGNI Vol.I, Plate 46 (page
327) and also in the film "Altar of Fire."
