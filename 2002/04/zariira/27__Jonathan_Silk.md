Colleagues:

Is there some general agreement on the etymology of the word zariira?
For reasons I do not entirely understand, there seem to be two roots
traditionally associated with the word, zri and zRR (boy, that comes
out looking weird in this system!). Mayrhoffer if I understand him
correctly seems to favor the latter.  Any thoughts or references?

many thanks, jonathan
