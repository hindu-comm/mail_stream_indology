Dear Indologists,
     I am forwarding a question from Professor Dhadphale of BORI in Pune.  I
will forward to him any responses there may be on Indology.  Best,
                                                   Madhav Deshpande

Dear Prof. Madhav,
In one of my paper written in Sanskrit about the nativity  of Bhavabhuti,
the celebrated dramatist in Sanskrit I gave evidence to prove that he was a
Dravidian and most probably a person from karnataka. A few persons  told me
that some one has tried to prove that he was a keralite. I shall like to
know the exact reference of this writing.
