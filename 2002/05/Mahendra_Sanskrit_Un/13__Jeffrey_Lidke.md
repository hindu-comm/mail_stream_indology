Colleaugues,

I was very sad to learn last night from Sthaneshwar
Timalsina, a Nepali
Sanskritist currently at UC Santa Barbara, that over
the weekend Maoist
rebels in Nepal reduced to ashes much of Mahendra
Sanskrit University's
main campus.  Dr. Timalsina estimates that the damage
is irreparable.

This is a great loss, not just for Nepal, but for the
international
community of Indologists.  Dr. Timalsina and I request
that we all do
whatever we can to bring the violence in Nepal to an
end.

thank you,

Jeffrey Lidke
