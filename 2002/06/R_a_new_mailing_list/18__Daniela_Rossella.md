Dearest Professor, many thanks for your so useful advice.
Unfortunately enough, the web - almost from Italy -
http://www/iias.nl/gateway/news/agasia is declared *Forbidden*, but I have
already written to the other address: IIASNEWS at LET.LEIDENUNIV.NL

Your news, and above all your kindness, have really touch my hearth of
scholar.

Many thanks,
Sincerely Yours,
Daniela Rossella
