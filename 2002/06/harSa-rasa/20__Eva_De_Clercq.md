In a tenth-century text I am working on, I just came across a reference
to "harSa-rasa" (as a technical term from drama and poetic theory). I
haven't found any mentioning of this rasa in any other works. Does anyone
know of any theoretical work on drama or poetics, perhaps one of a later
date, that does refer to this harSa-rasa?
