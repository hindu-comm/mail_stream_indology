Mumbai is often rendered as Mohamayii, yes.  Ahmedabad is rather too far
away from the town of Panvel, near south Bombay on the mainland.  I have
been looking at the local district maps, and there are several towns with
names like Parsipada, Umberpada, and Jambaltulpada.  The one likely
candidate for Mohapaata seems to be a town called Murbad near the city of
Kalyan near Mumbai.  I will see if I can get hold of more detailed maps in
our university library.  Best,
