Dearest Professor, an excellent book - but in Italian, alas! - is *Rabari -
Gli ultimi nomadi*, Stampa Alternativa - Nuovi Equilibri, Roma 1998.
The author, Francesco D'Orazi Flavoni, was an Italian diplomatic who lived
in India at least 20 years.

You can *see* it in visiting the home page of this very brilliant Italian
publishing house, which, by the way, often publishes also translations from
Sanskrit, Hindi, and so on: http://www.stampalternativa.it/
(E-mail: nuovi.equilibri at agora.stm.it)

All the best,
Daniela
