I am looking for studies on the subject of fate and free will (and related
issues) in Hinduism and/or Indic religions generally -- something to give
an overview, rather than in-depth studies of the technicalities of karma
theory, etc, of one particular school or author. All suggestions are welcome.

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
