Compare the Jaina satire called Bhara.takadv-atri.mzik-a. The Bhara.takas
are a sort of Shaiva ascetics depicted here as fools.  They are also
called bhauta, bhautika and ja.tin. See

Bhara.takadv-atri.mzik-a [Nagari script] = The thirty-two Bhara.taka
stories / ed. ... by Johannes Hertel. - Leipzig : Markert & Petters in
Komm., 1921. - 55 pp.

and

Zwei indische Narrenbücher : die zweiunddreißig
Bharataka-Geschichten und Somadewas Narrengeschichten /
vollständig verdeutscht von Johannes Hertel. - Leipzig : Haessel,
1922. - 222 pp. - (Indische Erzähler ; 5)
