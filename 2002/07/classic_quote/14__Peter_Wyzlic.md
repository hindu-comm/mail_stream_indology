In the Vacaspatyam the following verse is cited under
"jAtibrAhmaNa":

tapaH zrutaM ca yoniz ca trayaM brAhmaNyakAraNam |
tapaHzrutAbhyAM yo hIno jAtibrAhmaNa eva saH ||

As reference is given "ZabdArthaci[ntAmaNi]". Apte gives the same
verse and reference s.v. By the way, the first part of the stanza
can found in the AnuzAsanaparvan of the Mahabharata (according to the
PratIka index).

Hope it helps
