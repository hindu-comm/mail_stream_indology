Dear Martin,
        here are some MahAbhArata verses which may prove to be
relevant:

        dhAtaiva khalu bhUtAnAM sukhaduHkhe priyApriyau /
        dadhAti sarvam IzAnaH purastAc chukram uccaran //  3, 31.21


        uta santam asantaM ca bAlaM vRddhaM ca saMjaya /
        utA 'balaM balIyAsaM dhAtA prakurute vaze //
        uta bAlAya pANDityaM paNDitAyo 'ta bAlatAm /
        dadAti sarvam IzAnaH purastAc chukram uccaran //  5, 31.1-2

I consider it to be a theistic version of the epic (heroic) fatalism.
It implies, as it seems, the idea that DhAtA fixes destinies of all
living beings (limited number?) at the time of cosmic conception.
Hope it helps.
Regards,
                                Yaroslav Vassilkov
