I agree with Valerie Roebuck's suggestion to use the name of Tara, which
Tibetan folk etymologies associate with "saving" in a spiritual sense as
well as "star." A very good suggestion.
Also, since Tara is a common Irish name - no doubt with good
connotations in Gaelic, it won;t seem overly exotic to folks in LA.
