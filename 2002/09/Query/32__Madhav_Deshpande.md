In the performance of the Brahmayajna, one recites the initial lines of each Veda and Vedaanga.  However, in the recitation of the Vedas themselves, in Maharashtra, they start with "hari.h OM."  It is possible that the verse refers to the recitation of OM at the beginning of Vedapaa.tha as some sort of zaanti.  Best,
