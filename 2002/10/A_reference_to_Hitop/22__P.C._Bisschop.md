1.) The MBh reference is probably to the following star-passage
(MBh 1.2.83 97*) in the critical edition:
% N (except K1; K5 missing) T1 G7 ins.
% after 83ab:
01*0097_01 hitopade"sa"s ca pathi dharmaraajasya dhiimata.h
01*0097_02 vidure.na k.rto yatra hitaartha.m mlecchabhaa.sayaa

2.) For other relevant literature, consult:
