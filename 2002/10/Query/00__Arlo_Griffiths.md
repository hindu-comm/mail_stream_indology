> Manu 4.125 has the term niSkarSam. The meaning is unclear; most
> commentators take it to mean the "essence" of the Veda, i.e. OM. I am
> uncomfortable with this explanation; the verse is somewhat opaque. If
> Manu wanted to say that one should say OM before reciting the Veda,
> there were easier ways to say so; and he does so in Ch 2. The term
> means an extract, and I wonder whether it could be a brief passage of
> each Veda that can stad for the whole.
