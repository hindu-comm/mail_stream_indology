Subject: Recent queries on INDOLOGY re: Devanagari OCR

Dear Dominik,

CDAC ( URL http://www.cdacindia.com/html/gist/products/chitra.asp ) has
announced the release of a devanagari OCR software package called CHITRANKAN
.  I would be very interested to know if any of the INDOLOGY list members
have tried this, particularily on older typeset devanagari books.

Thanks,


Harry Spier
