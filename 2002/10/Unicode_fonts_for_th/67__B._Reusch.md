Friends,
First I wish to thank Dominik and everybody else who replied to my
previous post on a related topic.
Second, to narrow down my question.

Are there any Unicode fonts available that are good for Indologists
who are Mac users? Where? How (much)?

A local Unicode expert, who is not familiar with Sanskrit, wrote the
following to me:

Would those in the know care to share the info with the rest of us?
Thanks.

Beatrice Reusch
