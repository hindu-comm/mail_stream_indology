I agree with John Huntington (below) that Mair & Mallory's statement as
quoted (I hope not out of context!) is way beyond the pale. But it should
also be pointed out that an Iranian component in some forms of Buddhism is
not out of the question, though controversial. A sober treatment of the
issue is David Alan Scott's "The Iranian Face of Buddhism," in East and West
n.s. 40 (1990): 43-77.
