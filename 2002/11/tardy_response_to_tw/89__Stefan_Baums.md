Is it not preferable to interpret the name AzvaghoSa as "horse-voiced"
instead of "horse-eared," just as Buddhaghosa would seem to mean
"having the voice," not "ears," "of the Buddha"?  Having the voice of
a horse (strong, clear) is certainly desirable in a general way, but
maybe there is some more particularly Buddhist idea behind this
animal-voice imagery, cf. the oft-invoked siMhanAda.
