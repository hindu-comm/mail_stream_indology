Dear Reinhold:

I must be doing something wrong, but access to the site with ATIL was
denied to me. When I did try to download the MBh it wanted me to
download also the font which appeared as HELVSN---1.TTF; but on my
Word it did not show up as a font even after restarting the computer.
I am on a MAC with OS 9.2. Thanks.

Patrick Olivelle



>Dear list members,

>regard to the "ASCII-only" format: Instead of "Kyoto-Harvard" it will
>be a new transliteration called ATIL (ASCII Transliteration for
>Indian Languages) - sincere appologies for burdening the world with
>another acronym!

>ATIL encompasses the entire range of CSX+ (Classical Sanskrit
>Extended+) characters, which covers everything indologists may
>need for the practical purpose of entering and handling e-texts in
>Indian languages, and a lot more besides. It should be gratefully
>remembered that the indological community owes the bulk of
>e-texts to our Japanese colleagues, who achieved this feat with far
>less than what CSX+ offers. On the other hand, the world is still
>waiting for contributions of similar import from those who
>sometimes seem all too willing to follow the path of compliance all
>the way down to Redmond.

>Since it will take at least another two weeks to convert the entire
>GRETIL archive, there is enough time to take into account your
>comments!
