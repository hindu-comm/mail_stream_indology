There was at least one manuscript of a Hindi work from the 19th century in
the Wellcome Institute library which seemed to be a translation of a physics
textbook into Hindi and which had blue pencil annotations on it.
The best candidate I ever saw for a pre-press draft pre-modern Hindi
manuscript.
On the other hand there were also lots of what you might call 'common place
books' which had collections of notes and texts in them, but I don't think
they were ever intended for printing, or copying out neatly.
