Dear Joerg and All:
        I would recommend contacting Professor Rana P.B. Singh of Banaras
Hindu University. To my mind he is the leading scholar on pilgrimages
in Banaras and things related to them. His e-mail is
ranapbs at satyam,net.in
        By way of introduction, feel free to mention my name and say that I
recommended him to you.
        Best of luck with your research.

Best Wishes,
Brad Clough
