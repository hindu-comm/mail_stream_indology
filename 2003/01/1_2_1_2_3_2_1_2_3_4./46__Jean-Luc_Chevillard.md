It is curious to note that there is some parallel phenomenon
with "nAlvAy" in Tamil,
as was pointed to me once by Dominic Goodall,
when it appears in the tiruveZukURRirukkai
(tEvAram 1-128),
seemingly in a progression
that goes up and down several times
1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 ... etc. upto 7
and containing:
  Or uru "one form"
  Ir iyalpu "two natures"
  oru "one"
  iru cuTar "two luminaries"
  mummUrttikaL "three embodiments"
  ....
  nAlvAy
  etc.
[it goes by steps upto eZu "seven"]

One would expect nAlvAy to mean "four"
but it is in fact translated by "hanging jaw"
(for an elephant)

[for the record, that same meaning of nAlvAy
is also seen in tEvAram 1-102 (2)
