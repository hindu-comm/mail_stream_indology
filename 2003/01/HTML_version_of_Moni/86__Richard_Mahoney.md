Done.

The links and filenames at:

 http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/mw_dict/mw_dict.html

and in the archive at:

 http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/mw_dict/mw_dict_all_current.tar.gz

have been updated.

I've tested the site and archive under MS W2K and everything seems in
order. I don't have access to a Mac so can't comment on that count. If
anyone has any other issues please mail me (off list?) and I'll make
the necessary changes.


Regards,

 Richard Mahoney
