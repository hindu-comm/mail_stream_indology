At a wild guess, without seeing an illustration, this sounds like a
form of Suurya--especially if there are 7 horses, or one horse with 7

>A friend just asked me to identify the subject of a small sculpture which
>he recently came across at an antique dealer's, and estimated to be about
>200 years old. Being unable to help, I refer the question to this list.
>
>The sculpture in question (painted marble) depicts a male figure, sporting
>a thin moustache, with four arms and Vaishnava markings, seated sideways in
>lotus position on a horse-drawn cart. His four hands hold various objects,
>one being an akshara-mala and another (probably) a flaming cakra. The two
>remaining objects are more difficult to identify, though one may possibly
>be a book -- always assuming it is not the piece of cheese which, to my
>friend's eyes, it most resembled...

>Any suggestions welcome.
