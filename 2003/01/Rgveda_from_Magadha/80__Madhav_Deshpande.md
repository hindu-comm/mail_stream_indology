I have discussed in some detail the connection of the ZAkalya RV to the MANDUkeya tradition in my article "Genesis of the RV Retroflexion" which appeared in the volume Aryan and Non-Aryan in India edited by myself and Peter E. Hook.  This article is also included in my book Sanskrit and Prakrit: Sociolinguistic Issues.  The connection to Magadha is based on a reference in the SAMkhAyana AraNyaka VII.13 (Keith's edn of the Aitareya AraNyaka, p. 309) which says that Madhyama MANDUkeya, the son of PrAtibodhI, was a MagadhavAsI "resident of Magadha.

                                                                                        Madhav Deshpande
