There has been some interesting discussion on pa;ncaanana in Marathi between
Professors M.A. Mehendale and M.G. Dhadphale. I cannot locate it at present,
nor remember its precise content. The inquirer could contact both scholars
at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune 411 004.

In the meanwhile, I will simply observe that pa;nca could be connected to
the root pa;nc that is found in words such as prapa;nca and must have some
such sense as 'expand, proliferate.'
