In that case the stem would have been a consonantal one, that is,
prapa;ncan, and we would have come across a grammarian writing a deletion
rule for the final n. Besides, prapa;nca does not at least commonly occur in
the company of five elements, and compounds of pra with a numeral as the
second member do not seem to exist (e.g., I have not come across words like
pra-dvi or prada;sa).
