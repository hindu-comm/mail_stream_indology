Thanks, Arlo,

by way of Pratidaanam, some may also find several items here very useful:

http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/

i.e the Inca report (for my mythology class), if you forget all the 'pious'
Christian trappings at the beginning, or those from other reagions;
--      not to speak of Bhasa, Harsha, Kalidasa.
and all sorts of flashcards for beginners.
