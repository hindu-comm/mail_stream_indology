Yes, both at Prof. Tokunaga's own site in Kyoto
(ftp://ccftp.kyoto-su.ac.jp/pub/doc/sanskrit/dharmas/)
and via the extremely valuable  Goettingen Register of Electronic Texts in
Indian Languages (GRETIL), which we owe to Dr. R. Gruenendahl
(http://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/ebene_1/fiindolo/gretil.htm).
