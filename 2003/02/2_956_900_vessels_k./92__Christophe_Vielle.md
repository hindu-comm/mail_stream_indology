Thanks to Deviprasad and Harunaga for their suggestions.
So at the moment, the propositions are:
* ni.hsaare k.sutila+aakaara.h  with the unprobable hapax k.sutila
* ni.hsaara+ik.su-tila+aakaara.h  with the problem of the too small
ik.su-tila for the body of a child at his birth - but the similarity could
be not in the size but in the form of the "small shoot" (tila "small
particle" in the sense of dala ?) of sugar-cane when it is going out (from
the earth)
* ni.hsaare tu tila+aakaara.h with the same problem, even is a tila is
bigger than an ik.su-tila as a particle of sugar
* ni.hsaare ku.tila++aakaa.h - the "crooked form" would indeed fit well in
this case
I would not dare to add :
* ni.hsaare k.sut-ilaa+aakaara.h  with the form of a flow (ilaa) of
sneezing (k.sut f. from K.SU, in MkP)
* ni.hsaara+iipsu-tila+aakaara.h  with the form of a sesame-seed desirous
of going out

I take the opportunity of this message for recalling what was the main
question of my original message, assuming that there is at least some
people learned in medical literature on this list...

Could someone help me in giving the Sanskrit text of the verse of
Vaagbha.ta (the Elder)'s A.s.taa;ngasa.mgraha, /saariirasthaana 5.59
(reference from Meulenbeld's HIML), which gives the total amount of the
vessels in the body as being 2 956 900.

The number is interesting because in the Yaajñavalkyasm.rti (III, 101) the
number is slightly different, viz. 2 900 956 (ekonatri.mza.l lak.saa.ni
tathaa nava zataani ca / .sa.tpañcaazac ca), clearly confirmed by the
commentator Vijñaanezvara.
In Caraka it is only 29 956.
But in a physiological passage (which follows an embryological one) in the
Jaiminiiyasa.mhitaa of the Brahmaa.n.dapuraa.na (that my colleague Sandra
Smets is studying with me), which is usually very close to the text of the
sm.rti or to the content of Vijñaanezvara's commentary, however in this
case the total amount of the vessels is the same than in Vaagbha.ta:
navottaraa.ni dehe 'smin niyutaani ca vi.mzati.h /
.sa.tpañcaazat sahasraa.ni zataani nava caadhikam /
siraadhamanyor milita.h zaakhaabheda udiirita.h //JaiSa 47 .58
viz. 29 niyutas (= 2 900 000) and 56 900 = 2 956 900

Thank you very much for your help
