Dear Madhav,

Do you think that the standard textbook rule of thumb for stress accent in
Sanskrit (penultimate or antepenultimate syllable) is accurate in all cases?
Is there, for example, a tendency to stress the root syllable in verb forms
contrary to this rule (e.g. ku'rvanti, pratipa'dayanti)? Or can there be a
double stress (primary  + secondary) in some long words? Or does the pattern
vary from region to region or speaker to speaker? In short, is there any
real standard on this, and if so, what is it?

Please send me your thoughts when you get a chance. Nothing urgent.

Rich
