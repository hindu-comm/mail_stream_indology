If it is not Sanskrit (or otherwise Indogermanic, e.g., Prakrit) then it
could be a Sanskritised Dravidian word. Kannada has a word he.d.da, "a dull,
stupid man, a fool" (Kittel's dictionary, Madras 1971 edition, vol. 4, p.
1755), with related a derived words like he.d.datana / he.d.du "stupidity,
foolishness", he.d.daa.ta "stupid, foolish behaviour". Perhaps this is a
description of a person's behaviour when he is possessed by a certain kind
of bhuuta?
