Dear Indologists,
without revealing his source Louis Frederic claims in his book "Borobudur" (p. 75 of the German version published by Hirmer Verlag, MÃ¼nchen in 1995; the French original is from 1994) that "jaya" stands for the number "108", because the Sanskrit letters "ja" and "ya" denote respectively "1" and "8", and the "zero inbetween can be ignored".
Is this explanation for "108" found elsewhere?
What is the source for this (to me new) equation of "ja" and "ya" with "1" and "8"?


With many thanks and regards, 
                                    Alexander v. Rospatt
