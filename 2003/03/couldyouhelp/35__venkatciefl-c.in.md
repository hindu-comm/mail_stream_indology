Dear colleagues,

I am looking for resources on uses/receptions of Panchatantra in the
Persian/Islamic traditions (Kalila wa Dimna, Anware-suheili etc) for a
project.  I am keen on material especially in visual forms  - calligraphy,
textiles, windowglass motifs,  - in short the various modes in which the
Panchatantra themes might have manifested.

I would be grateful for any kind of help.
