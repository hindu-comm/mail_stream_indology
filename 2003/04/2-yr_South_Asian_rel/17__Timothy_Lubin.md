I hope list members will forgive this reposting.  Approval has now been
granted to make this a two-year position.  Applications will be accepted
through April 20.

The Religion Department of Washington and Lee University seeks to fill
a *two-year* sabbatical-replacement position in the study of South Asian
religions (undergraduate-level) beginning in the fall of 2003, with a
focus on Hinduism and Buddhism.  Teaching responsibilities over each
three-term year will include two sections of "Introduction to Asian
Religions" (to cover South and East Asia), two sections of another
survey course, and three seminars.  (Sections of lecture courses are
capped at 25 students.)  Applicants with teaching experience and Ph.D.
degree in hand by fall  2003 will be given preference.  Applications are
still being accepted and should include a current c.v., transcripts of
graduate study, and three letters of recommendation, and may be sent to
the Asian Search Committee, Department of Religion, Newcomb Hall,
Washington and Lee University, Lexington, VA 24450.
