The web-site of the 12th World Sanskrit Conference has recently been
updated. The address is still the same, i.e. the following:

http://www.helsinki.fi/hum/aakkl/12wsc

The pages contain a tentative timetable of the conference week, list of
participants & titles of their papers, and much more practical
information. We plan to update the list of participants a few times
before the conference week in July.

Conference Secretary
