Dear List Members,
I am doing some research on the development of Hindi greetings, and on the
use of Namaskar.
In particular I'm looking for references in early 20th century nationalist
literature to the use of Namaskar as a national greeting, as prior to this
it seems to have been a greeting only used by Brahmins, or to Brahmins by
twice-born castes.
has anybody ever seen anything on this?
