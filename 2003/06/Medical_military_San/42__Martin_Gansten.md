I would be grateful if anyone could comment on the following possibly
technical terms, found in an 18th century Sanskrit text:

1. senAmatya: 'army minister'. Is this a standard term with a standard
translation?
2. dhanasandhi: 'money treaty'. Is this perhaps a synonym of kA~ncanasandhi
as mentioned by MW? (The context is a treaty between two kings after a war.)
3. prANagarbha: 'living foetus'? Is this simply a non-stillborn child?
4. trigaNDajala: apparently some sort of afflicting (pID-) disease; but
what sort?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
