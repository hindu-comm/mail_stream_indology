Thank you very much to Peter Scharf for all these elements answering to
Smets's questions perfectly.


>Both Lakshman Sarup's edition of Nirukta and Bhadkamkar's edition
>(Bombay Sanskrit and Prakrit Series LXXXV) of Nirukta with Durga's
>commentary contain both parisistas.  Sarup's edition does not contain
>a translation of the parisistas.  Durga does not comment upon the
>second parisista which means it was added to the collection of
>earlier chapters of the Nirukta after Durga and probably means its
>composition post-dates Durga.  His date is much debated.  Sarup dated
>him as early as 1st...but no later than 13th c.  Kunhan Raja before
>600 and Eivind Kahrs (Indian Semantic Analysis, p. 14): 6th c.  A
>closer examination of the relationship of the 2nd parisista with
>other texts would probably contribute to its dating.
