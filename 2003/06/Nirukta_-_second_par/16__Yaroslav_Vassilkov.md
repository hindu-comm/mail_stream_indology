Many cordial thanks to Peter M.Scharf for his exhaustive answer to my
question on the date of the Nirukta's 2nd pariziSTa. Dear Peter, if
you don't mind, I will refer to your posting in the article that I am working on now
(the proposed title is "The GItA versus the AnugItA: SAMkhya and Yoga in Unity,
Conflict and Dialogue").
