There is also a CD ROM version of the Derge (both Bkah-hgyur and Bstan-hgyur, I
believe) produced in Japan. Does anyone know any details about this? How does
it compare to the TBRC version? Koshin Suzuki mentions it in his edition of
the  Sravakabhumi (http://www.chofukuji.jp/de_Jong/souvenir/SraBh-TD.pdf).
There is also a website in Japanese (which I can't read) at:http://www.ksk-
jp.com/derge/derge.html. I was just curious as to whether anyone out there had
any experience with this version.
