I think this is an example of a spontaneous thing appearing to be
caused. One sees the illusory reflection of the moon in flowing water, a
favorite image, and also notes a bubble forming there, as if somehow
caused by the moon rays striking the water - the seond realization is
that of course the moon appearing there being but a reflection could
have no causal impact on the water. So it is nice for its purpose,
exemplifying not only a random thing, but one that might appear at first
not to be random.
