Dear list-members,

this is most probably the virus "W32.Bugbear.B at mm". See the following page
for further information, also on how to remove it from your system:

ml

The virus can take a subject-line from existing messages in a mailbox on
the computer and use its subject-line to forward itself to e-mail-addresses
stored somewhere on the computer (mailbox, address book). This is what
happened in Whitney Cox' case.


Best regards,

Birgit Kellner
