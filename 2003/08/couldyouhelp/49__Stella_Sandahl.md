Dear Dr.  Venkat Rao,
To answer your question nr. 2 - yes there are two more annotated English
translations of the Citrasutra, one  by C. Sivaramamurti: Chitrasutra of the
Vishnudharmottara   New Delhi : Kanak, 1978. and the other by Priyabala
Shah: Shri Vishnudharmottara, a text of ancient Indian arts, Ahmedabad
1990?.  Dr. Shah has also edited the third khanda (Gaekwad's Oriental series
no. 130) 1994. There is a Hindi translation by P. Dvivedi and Bindu Dube,
Varanasi : Kala Prakasana, 1997.
