I have snail-mail and phone info (from a possibly-outdated Harvard web-page):

Lawrence J. McCrea
Visiting Lecturer of Sanskrit
1 Bow Street, Room 313
Tel: (617) 384-7774

I also have a possibly-outdated (2000) email for him at Chicago:

ljmccrea at midway.uchicago.edu

Hope this helps.
David Magier
