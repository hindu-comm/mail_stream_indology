Hi,

        My email, for the moment, is the address given above.  (I'll be moving
to Harvard in a couple of weeks, and will probably change my email at
that time, but I don't yet know what the address will be.)

Yours,
        Larry McCrea
        Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations
        University of Chicago
