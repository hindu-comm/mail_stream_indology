Dear Colleagues,

Preliminary databases containing Sanskrit-Tibetan Buddhist Terminology
have been prepared. For further details, documentation and screen
shots see:

    http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/links/links.html


These databases are meant to be used with the Dictionary Server
Protocol (DICT). For details see:

This is work-in-progress. If you notice errors please mail me.


Best regards,

 Richard Mahoney
