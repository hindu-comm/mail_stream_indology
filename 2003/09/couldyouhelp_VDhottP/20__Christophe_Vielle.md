The "standard" (and in fact only complete) edition of the VDhottP is the
Venkateshvara Press one (V.S. 1969/A.D. 1913; about the defaults of which,
see Hazra's Studies in the upapur-a.nas I, 1958, pp. 155 sq), a reprint of
which is available at Nag Publishers with an index of the beginnings of
verses. Priyabala Shah has produced a bit better "crit." ed.  of the third
kha.n.da (citras-utras etc.) in two vols of the Gaekwad's Oriental Series
in Baroda (nos 130 and 137), and has recently published an English
translation of the whole work (3 vols, Delhi, 2002, Parimal Sanskrit Series
51). The latter seems not to be aware of A. Gail's important researches on
the work (e.g. discovery of quotations from Var-ahamihira -  cf. already
Kane, HDh/S 5/2 pp. 877-78, which means around 550 A.D. as the terminus
post quem, contra Hazra 1958 - the 7th century appears in fact as a more
reasonable date for the work). As Prof. Gail stated at the last WSC: "of
utmost importance would be a critical edition of the VDhott, for the two
available editions are based on late and corrupt manuscripts" .

Dr.R. Nagaswamy, former Director of Archaeology, Tamilnadu and Former Vice
chancellor of the kanchipuram university, informs me that he is organising
a International Seminar on Mahabharata at Kanchipuram from 24th to 28th
Dec. this year. The theme is on the impact of Mahabharata on the religious
and artistic life of the people of India and South East Asia.
He would be happy to send further information to the persons interested who
might be visiting India at that time and  could adjust their itinery to
attend the Conference.
The same  informs me that he had already organised an International
conference on Arts and religion in 2001 at Chidambaram that was well
attended,  of which the papers are published under the title of Foundations
of Indian Art.

>come across English translations of either parts of or only the last part
>(Chitrasutra) of the Purana?  I would be keen to know whether the entire

>
>2)      Is there any extended critical work (apart from Stella

>introduction) on the Chitrasutra in English?
>
>3)      Could some one suggest me what kind of readings are available on the
>Sutra genre?  Is Louis Renou’s “Sur le genre du sutra dan la

>Sanskrite” available in English translation?
