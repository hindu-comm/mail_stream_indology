,
I am Ganesan in charge of the Cataloguing and preservation project of the
French Institute, Pondicherry.
I am very glad to know from your mail Indology-group) that a new CD has been
released from NGMPP. From your mail I gather that it contains all the the
information
found on these cards, such as Title, Author, No. of Folios, State, Size,
Script, Language, Material, Date (if dated), Reel No. etc.
and also other new search facilities.
May I know the price of the CD ?
The procedure, etc. for getting it?
As of now is there any facility for scholars to know the details of the
manuscript collection ?
Please inform me about these.
Regards,

Ganesan
