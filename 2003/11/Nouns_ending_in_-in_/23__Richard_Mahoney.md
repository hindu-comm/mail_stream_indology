In case they may be useful, I've just printed out all the Skt
headwords (with and without definitions) in M-W that end in `-in'.

For headwords and definitions (utf-8) see:

 http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/mw_dict/in_suffix_def.txt (1.6Mb)

For headwords alone (simplified translit, refer to above for details) see:

Best regards,

 Richard Mahoney
