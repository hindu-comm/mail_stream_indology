This is most welcome, many thanks, hopefully even more texts will be made
available soon. But, the choice of the name Muktabodha for your organisation
seems infelicitous. I assume it is intended to be muktaanaa.m bodha.h (tatpuru.sa)
but it suffers from the defect of viruddhamatik.rddo.sa.h (Kaavyaprakaa"sa
7.51)--- the name generates a jarring opposite meaning: mukta.h (=vigata.h)
bodho ye.saa.m te (bahuvriihi), which may mean something like "the stupid". Can
you not change your name slightly to avoid this unfortunate defect?
