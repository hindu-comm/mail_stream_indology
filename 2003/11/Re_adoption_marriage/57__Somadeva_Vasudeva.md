Is it not possible that we have here the more common situation where the
father "appoints" his daughter a putrikaa first? A man without a son may "appoint"
his daughter. Her sons inherit all of her father's wealth. If she dies
without a son, her husband inherits. Cf Manusm.rti 9.127--139. Like this, there are
no marital complications.

The satirist K.semendra makes fun of such arrangements.

hope this helps,
