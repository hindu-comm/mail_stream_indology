Subject: OpenType Devanagari Font Sanskrit 2003

Dear Indologists,

As of 15th December 2003, the OpenType Unicode font
"Sanskrit 2003" is available. This Devanagari font
was developed by Swami Satchidananda and me during
the past two years.

"Sanskrit 2003" is the first font in the history of
Devanagari typography including COMPLETE ligatures
of ALL conjunct consonants attestable by quotations
from original Sanskrit works described in my German
linguistics book on "Conjunct Consonants in Sanskrit".

"Sanskrit 2003" is documented in my 100-page technical manual
