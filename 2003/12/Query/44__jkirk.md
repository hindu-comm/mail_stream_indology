Greetings of the season, dear Indologues,

Is there anyone on the list who recites Vedas or Upanishads in Sanskrit, who
has an appealing voice (not like Henry Kissinger, e.g.), and who may have
made tapes of him or herself reciting? Please reply to me off list. I hope
someone is out there who has done this. Please advise and thanks.

All best wishes,
Joanna Kirkpatrick
