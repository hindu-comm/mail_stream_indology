Böhtlingk’s Indische Sprüche (plus August Blau’s index in
Abhandlungen für die Kunde des Morgenlandes IX.4) and Sternbach’s
Mahā‐subhāṣita‐saṁgraha (to the extent available, i.e., a through
gī) can help.  At least they served me well in a similar
situation, tracking down the Sanskrit inscription on Rasmus Rask’s
gravestone; full report here:

It still takes a lot of digging, though.

Best wishes,
Stefan

PS.  What are “Jacob’s three books”?
