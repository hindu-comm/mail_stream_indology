Perhaps you are thinking of the famous death poems of Zen monks and other
poets in Japan? Like Saigyo's death poem, written perhaps a decade earlier
according to La Fleur, 2003 (his translation):

Let it be in spring
and under the cherry blossoms that
I die, while the moon
is perfect at midmonth, like
it was for his peaceful passing. (refers to the Buddha, of course)

> Yes, thank you, that is certainly the sort of poem I remembered.  I don't
think it is the same one, but of the same genre. Thanks again,
