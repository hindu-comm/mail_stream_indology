A friend in Pune has sent me two photos of the destruction in the BORI
reading rooms.  See
        http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgadkw/ANAsm.jpg

I have also made a link to this image from the "Members' queries and
information" part of the INDOLOGY website.


(If you find INDOLOGY's website address hard to remember, you can get to
it via

        http://indology.info

although you get a bit of advertising at the top of the screen.)
