The "Sabhaji Brigade" attack on Professor S. Bahulkar and Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Pune has to be viewed very seriously. It may be noted in this connection that this incident has taken place at a moment when the Govt. of India has launched its multicrore National Manuscripts Mission project.I doubt that the Sangh Pariwar and its allies have some hidden agenda of destroying existing old precious manuscripts and cooking up new ones so as to put new claims like that of "Vedic Saraswati."
