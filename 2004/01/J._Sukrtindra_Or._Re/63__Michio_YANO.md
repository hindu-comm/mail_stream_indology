Dear  Professor J. L. Brockington,
> Does anyone have an address (e-mail or postal) for either the Sukrtindra
> Oriental Research Institute (located in Thammanam, Kochi -- that is all I
> can find) or for Dr Sreeramula Rajeswara Sarma (at Aligarh some years ago)?
> The point is that we want to get hold of a recent article by him ("The Mango
> Motif in Sanskrit Poetry") in the journal of the institute.  I have tried
> searching library catalogues (via both COPAC and the Karlsruher Virtuelle
> Katalog) for the journal without result.
