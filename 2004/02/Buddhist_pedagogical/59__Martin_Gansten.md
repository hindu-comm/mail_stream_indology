A friend who is not a member of this list has asked me to post the
following query on his behalf:

>I am looking for references to studies on concrete
>pedagogical situations in Buddhist history, e.g.
>studies on how a monk or nun was trained, how
>scriptures were used, what scriptures were used
>(shaastra/aagama/...), different functions in the
>monastery, or similar questions. Any reference would
>be helpful. The more concrete the better (but that is
>perhaps too much to hope for when it comes to
>Indian history ;-)

Many vicarious thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
