Papers are invited for a multidisciplinary international seminar to be

classified under the following (and other) themes:

·     Edward Said in retrospect
·     Differentiating Orientalisms
·     Orientalism and history re-oriented
·     Orientalism and other discourses of imperialism
·     Orientalism and continuing debates on postcoloniality/the
"postcolonial" ·     Orientalism and Culture Studies ·     Orientalism
and Global Studies ·     Orientalism and Visual Culture ·     Gender
and Orientalism ·     Enlightenment and Orientalism ·     Orientalism
and Romanticism ·     Occidentalism and Orientalisms in reverse
