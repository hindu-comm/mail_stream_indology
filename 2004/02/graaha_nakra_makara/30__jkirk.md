Going to the web page to see this magnificent picture and the makaras, I
note that in this case they are spouting live lotuses from their tails
instead of their mouths that seem to support some kind of bird (the
resolution is not clear enough to discern more than that). It also looks as
though the deities just above their mouths are meant to be seen as having
been ejected from their mouths? or not?
