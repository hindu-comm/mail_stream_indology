>On behalf of a student, I would like to ask you about Sanskrit texts

>the courtesan fits this description, but the student would also like to
>know if there are texts that describe more "mainstream" women in this
>manner. Such women could for instance be aristocrats or religious
>specialists. I would be grateful for any references/suggestions.
