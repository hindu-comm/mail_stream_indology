Sheldon has improved my translation, for which many thanks:

>  te.saa.m uktau pramaa.na.m ca maduktau na katha.m bhavet /
>  tasmaat subhaa.sita.m graahyam iti sarvatra ni"scita.m //

          Their statements carry weight; why shouldn't mine?
          Therefore in every case it's clear that whatever is
          well said (= well argued) should be accepted.
