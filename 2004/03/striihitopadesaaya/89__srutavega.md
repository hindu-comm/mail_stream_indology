> On behalf of a student, I would like to ask you about Sanskrit texts
> that portray women described as having knowledge and agency. Typically,
> the courtesan fits this description, but the student would also like to
> know if there are texts that describe more "mainstream" women in this
> manner. Such women could for instance be aristocrats or religious
> specialists. I would be grateful for any references/suggestions.
