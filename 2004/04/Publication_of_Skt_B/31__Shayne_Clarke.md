I believe the facsimile edition has just been, or is certainly about
to be, published by the team at Taisho University (The Institute for
Comprehensive Studies of Buddhism, Taisho University). Although their
webpage does not seem to have been recently updated, their previous
facsimile publications (Sravakabhumi, Vinayasutra, Abhisamacarika)
are available from the following url:

http://www.tmx.tais.ac.jp/sobutsu/
http://www.tmx.tais.ac.jp/sobutsu/Hon.htm (publications)

In any case, Yoshiyasu Yonezawa would certainly be able to help.
y_yonezawa at mail.tais.ac.jp
y-yonez at ya2.so-net.ne.jp

Please also note that a number of transliterated e-texts are also
available from their website.

Sincerely,
