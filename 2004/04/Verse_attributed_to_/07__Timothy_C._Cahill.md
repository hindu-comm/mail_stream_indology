Dear Don, Allen, et al,

   I meant to send this in one week back about the verse below:

> Look to this day! For yesterday is but a dream
> And tomorrow is only a vision
> But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness
> And tomorrow a vision of hope.
> Look well, therefore, to this day!

pazyantv enaM dinaM sarve  svapnam eva tu hystanam /

jIvaM kRtvAdya dharmeNa  bhuNkte pUrvaM sadA purA  //

(Apologies for the potentially faulty transliteration!)

best,
Tim Cahill
