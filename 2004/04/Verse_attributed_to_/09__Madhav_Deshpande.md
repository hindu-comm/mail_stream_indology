Can't imagine this being from Kaalidaasa, with a metrical fault in 'tu hyastanam'.  The fifth syllable in each of the feet of the classical AnuSTubh is supposed to be laghu.  Also the expressions "dinam pazya' and 'jIvam kRtvA' don't sound like classical skt.  Is this some kind of modern Skt rendering from English?

Where does this come from?  (Presumably the last word of line one
should be 'hyastanam'?)
