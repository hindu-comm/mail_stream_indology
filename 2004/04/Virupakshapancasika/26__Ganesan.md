I doubt whether Virupaakshapancaasikaa has ever been translated into
English.
It was first published in Trivandrum Sanskrit Series (TSS); then from
Sampurnanad Samskrit University, Varanasi in their Yogatantragranthamala
series with the commentary of Vidyachakravarti. Most probabaly available at
Sampurnanad Samskrit University,
