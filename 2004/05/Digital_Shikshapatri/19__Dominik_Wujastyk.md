------------ forwarded info ----------------------

Digital Shikshapatri provides instant online access to a treasure of the
British Hindu cultural heritage that is held in Oxford's Bodleian Library.

This fragile Sanskrit manuscript, called the Shikshapatri, was written by
Shree Swaminaryan, founder of Swaminarayan Hinduism, and outlines moral
and spiritual codes for everyday life.
