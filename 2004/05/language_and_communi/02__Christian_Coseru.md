Dear List Members,

A colleague of mine is inquiring about academic work that explores the
specific role of language(s) in the exchange and communication of ideas
in India. This can include, for instance, any studies on the importance
of Sanskrit as a unifying language for the Indian civilization as well
as studies that examine the similar role that languages such as Hindi
and English have played in modern times.

I would be very grateful if you could give me some suggestions.

Thanks,
Christian Coseru
