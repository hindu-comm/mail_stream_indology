Dear members of the list,

I am translating a puraa.nic text which contains a yogic teaching and
enumerates the eight members of the yoga. In a verse dealing with the
"dhaara.naa", the author mentions "receptacles" (aadhaara) in a numerical
series (9-12-6). I can not find what it refers to : could anyone help me in
decoding these numbers ? The verse runs as follows :
navaantadvaadas/aantaanta.sa.daadhaare.sv ananyadhii.h /
dhaarayeta yathaanyaaya.m dhaara.naasthaanayogavit //

Thank you in advance,
