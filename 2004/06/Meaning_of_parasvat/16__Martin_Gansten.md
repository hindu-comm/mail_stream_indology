Patrick Olivelle, in his translation of KauUp 1.2, translates parasvat as
'rhinoceros', rather than the 'wild ass' suggested by MW. He does note the
variant reading paraÂ´svat (MW: 'snake'), but as far as I can see, there is
no comment on the rhinoceros translation. Can anyone enlighten me on the
background?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
