The 11th cent. Buddhist Kaalacakra tantra (2nd pa.tala, vv. 6-8) 
employs the names of the ten avataaras of Vi.s.nu to designate ten 
phases of human life, from conception to death. I would be grateful 
for any references to comparable usage in other Indic sources, or for 
expert judgement that this usage is unique to the Kaalacakra.
