> This of course raises the larger question of when exactly the
> das'aavataara scheme takes on its canonical form. The late
> A.L. Basham once remarked to me that he did not know of
> its datable occurrence in the literature prior to the
> das'aavataaracarita of K.semendra, which would imply
> that the Kaalacakra is in fact the earliest roughly
> datable source. But on the surface it seems that this
> can't be correct. I join with Prof. Newman in seeking
> enlightenment from those who are expert in the early 
> Vai.s.nava corpus. Of course, art historical evidence
> might also help to date the basic ten avataara scheme.
