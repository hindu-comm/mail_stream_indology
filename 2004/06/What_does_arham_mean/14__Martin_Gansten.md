McComas,

It's a sort of Jaina mulamantra. I'm pretty sure I've seen it discussed in
Hemacandra's Yogasastra (when proofreading the manuscript of Olle
Qvarnstr√∂m's translation), but couldn't find it just now. In any case, I am
sure there are many people on this list who can tell you more; Jainism
isn't really my field at all.
