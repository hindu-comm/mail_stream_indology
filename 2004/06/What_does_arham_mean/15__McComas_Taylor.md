Dear Friends

The first chapter of PUrNabhadra's PaJcatantra opens with the words:

arham | auM namaH zrIsarasvatyai |

The other four chapters open with the single word

arham |

Can any of you good folk tell me what arham means in this context? Is it
commonly used in this way?

Many thanks in advance.

McComas
