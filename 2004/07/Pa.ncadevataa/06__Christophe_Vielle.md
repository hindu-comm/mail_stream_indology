Dear Greg,
about the Pañcadevataa concept and the Pañcaayatanapuujaa there are
interesting commentaries by Hazra in his Studies in the upapuraa.nas, vol.
II, pp. 447-50 (with references to the KuuP, MatP, etc.) and p. 394 and 420
(on the DeviiBhgP).

>Dear List,
>
>In my ongoing attempts to date the Ga.nezapuraa.na I am focussing in part on
>the Pa.ncadevataa concept which occurs everywhere in the second book.  I
>would appreciate any references to secondary sources on this and any hints
>as to its earliest occurrence in Sanskrit literature.

>Thanks in advance,
