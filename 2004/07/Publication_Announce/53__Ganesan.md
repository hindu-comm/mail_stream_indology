Summary
The Diptâgama is a Sanskrit shaiva treatise pertaining to the 
Saivasiddhânta religious system. It deals mainly with the 
installation of images of gods in Siva temples: installation rituals 
(pratistha), iconography, iconometry and architecture. It was 
hitherto unpublished and the present critical edition (to be 
published in 3 volumes) is based upon several manuscripts belonging 
to the collection of the French Institute, Pondicherry. This first 
volume deals especially with mantras and temple architecture as well 
as with numerous iconographical descriptions and with the 
installation of Sivalinga in the temple (Lingapratistha). The 
Sanskrit text is printed in Nagari script with copious critical 
apparatus. There is an Introduction and a detailed chapterwise 
summary (in French).
Keywords: agamas; iconography; saivism; Sanskrit; temple
