I would like to identify this snake with the common krait but one should
also consider the markings on the skin of some snake's which look
eye-like -- some snakes are said to be "spectacled" for this reason --
though the krait is black with white zigzag stripes.

There seems to be a certain amount of leeway in nominations for the snake
with the highest fatality rate. I have found dozens of scientific websites
that give this dubious honour to the Russell's viper which is frequently
said to have killed more people than any other snake world-wide.

Best wishes,
