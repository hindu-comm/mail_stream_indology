The article in question has been published in

        Sarupa-Saurabham : tributes to indology ; Lakshman Sarup
        centenary volume / ed. by Ashvini Agrawal. - New Delhi : Harman
        Publishing House, 2003, p. 17-20

So far I can see Morton Smith does not deal with snakes in a zoological
sense. The article is about fighting against enemies in a mythological
language or framework.

Hope it helps
