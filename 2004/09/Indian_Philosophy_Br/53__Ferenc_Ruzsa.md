Dear Plamen,

According to the Cologne on-line dictionary, the oldest word  (RV)is perhaps
mastiSka
also classical (suSruta, sARGgadhara-saMhitA) are
mastu-luGga and mastu-luGgaka,
and the group
goda, gorda and gordha
is found only in dictionaries.
I don't recall having seen any of them in philosophical texts.

Yours,
Ferenc

Subject: Indian Philosophy Brainless?


> Dear members,
>
> Is there an equivalent to brain in Indian darsanas or Ayurvedic teachings?
> There is [I]manas[/I] (mind) in the heart, [I]buddhi[/I] (intellect) I
don't
> know where, but probably in the - and serving as the - universal matrix of
> all [I]mahabhutas[/I], [I]cetas[/I] (pure conscious mentality) which
> contains and is made up of pure [I]manas-sattva[/I], and all these three
are
> often referred to as [I]citta[/I] (consciousness).
>
> None of them is even slightly the brain.

> Could you give me some guidance in my attempts to find the brain traces in
