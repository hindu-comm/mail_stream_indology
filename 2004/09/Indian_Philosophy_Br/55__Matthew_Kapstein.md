Perhaps it is of some interest to recall, too,
that in Buddhist tantrism it is the location
of the cakra from which there issues a cooling
flow of "camphor," which reminds us that for Aristotle
the brain was not an organ of thought (the function of
the heart), but rather served to cool down the body.
