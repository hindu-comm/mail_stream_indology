For the lexicographical record, please also note mast.rha.n-, 
previously only known from Kau;sikasuutra 11.16 (see Ingrid 
Eichner-Kühn, Vier altindische Wörter, Münchener Studien zur 
Sprachwissenschaft 34 [1976], 21--37), but now attested in the 
Atharvaveda, Paippalaadasa.mhitaa 17.21.1 (see Die Sprache 42/1-2 
[2000/01, publ. 2003], p. 201 and n. 8).
