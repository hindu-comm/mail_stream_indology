Dear List,

I have not noticed on this list any mention of the death of our valued
colleague, Julia Leslie.  I did not know her personally, but I have always
admired her work, and I would like to convey my condolences to her family,
friends, and colleagues.

The community of Indologists has suddenly become much smaller.

Sincerely,

George Thompson
