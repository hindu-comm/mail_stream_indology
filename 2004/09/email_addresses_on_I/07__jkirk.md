This is a serious problem, so please allow me to suggest getting some
freeware that seeks out data miner spy implants (bots) and allows you to
delete them. I run it every day before I begin doing email or internet. It
is called Adaware
http://www.noadware.net/?hop=wintech
It has reduced the amount of spam and virus infected stuff that comes my
way.
It also updates and that's free too.
Best wishes,
Joanna Kirkpatrick
