You probably did not find it because the link to it from their
main Election Manifesto page

   http://bjp.org/manifes/manife99.htm

is broken.  So unless one is able to guess the direct URL, it is
indeed currently inaccessible.  But that is probably just a case
of sloppy website maintenance rather than of deeper political
significance.

All best,
Stefan
