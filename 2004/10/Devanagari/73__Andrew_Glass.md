For the record,

 > I believe it was Stiehl himself who made the font for the Ashram.

I quote from an email from Ulrich Stiehl (9/27/2003)
"I had to work many months to evaluate so many texts for conjuncts,
and Swami Satchidananda had to work many months to design all the
ligatures."
I understand this to mean that Swami Satchidananda designed the font and
that Ulrich Stiehl consulted on its coverage on conjuncts.
