Ken,

Pratiruupa (èforméthing on the other sideè cp. Pratibimba, pratika;ncuka)
and pratilipi have the sense of ècopy.è pratiruupita is the past passive
participle of the denominative root pratiruupay. The expression, therefore,
probably means, ècopying time, the date on which the copy was completed.è
Could it be that one digit is missing in Èi05ÈÉ
