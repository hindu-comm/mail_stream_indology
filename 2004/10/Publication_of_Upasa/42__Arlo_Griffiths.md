Dear Dr. Joshi,

Thank you for this announcement. Could you please indicate --- for
those who are, like me, uninitiated in this field of literature --- in
what relation, if any, Lak.smii Naatha Bha.t.ta's text stands to
Vaasudeva's Gopaalaarcanapaddhati, published recently by Gaya Charan
Tripathi in his book

Communication with God.
