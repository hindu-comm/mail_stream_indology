Although of course there are no "word breaks" per 
se, Klaus Janert has written about the way(s) in 
which Asokan inscriptions do have gaps, and 
speculated on the meaning of such gaps. Although 
I don't have the book itself right at hand, I 
think the work in which he discusses this is (but 
it has been a long time since I looked at this, 
and he may indeed have addressed the subject in a 
different work):

Janert, Klaus Ludwig. 1972. Abstände und 
Schlussvokalverzeichnungen in Aßoka-Inschriften, 
Verzeichnis der Orientalischen Handschriften in 
Deutschland, Supplementband 10 (Wiesbaden: Franz 
Steiner Verlag).

No doubt other colleagues can give more details.
