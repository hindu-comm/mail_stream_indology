Dear Lars,

The best Sanskrit edition of Yoga-sutra is the sAngaM yogadarsanam, arthAt
pAtanjaladarsanam, published for the first time in Benares, 1935 by the
Caukhamba Sanskrit Series Office.
But I don't think it will be translated soon into English.

The best English translation so far is this

Regards,
Plamen
