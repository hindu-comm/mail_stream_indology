If this contains the same comments (bhAsvatI) of Hariharananda Aranya on the
Vyasa-bhasya, which are included in the Yoga-darsana cited before, that
would be a wonderful text.
Provided the translation is full and faithful.

I may perhaps suggest the following edition and translation of the YS (with
the commentary of Vyaasa) :
H. Ara.nya (ed.), Yoga philosophy of Pataïjali : containing his yoga
aphorisms with commentary of Vyaasa in original Sanskrit, and annotations
thereon with copious hints on the practice of yoga, rendered into English
by P.N. Mukerji, Calcutta : University of Calcutta, 1963 (19772, 19813).
