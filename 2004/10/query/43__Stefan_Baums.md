A quick search for ṣaṣṭik* in the electronic text gives the
following result:

   MBh13.txt:13063014a ghr̥takṣīrasamāyuktaṁ vidhivat ṣaṣṭikaudanam
   Supp13.txt:13_014_0104 kṣīreṇa ṣaṣṭikān bhuktvā sarvapāpaiḥ pramucyate

where the file “Supp13.txt” contains material relegated to the
appendix of the critical edition.
