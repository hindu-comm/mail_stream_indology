Dear Birgit,

I'm in the middle of doing a small critical edition myself at the moment,
using Ledmac.  Would it be useful for me to send you my Ledmac input file,
and a PDF of the output?  It's only half done, so it's a bit scrappy, but
the important bits about the use of Ledmac are all okay.

Best,
Dominik
