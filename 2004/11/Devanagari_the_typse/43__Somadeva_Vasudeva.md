To my
knowledge, there are no unicode compliant typesetting systems
currently available that are capable of producing high quality
multilingual critical editions.

Have you seen XeTeX? (http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=xetex) Works with Unicode Devanagari and Ledmac, you can also use attractive (Venetian) commercial Opentype fonts.
