Dear Lars Martin,

in addition to the message by Ms. Slaczka, I can confirm that indological
research, albeit not on the department level, is being done in Poznan
(Sanskrit, Hindi and Tamil). And as far as I know there are also indologists
at the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL).

Best regards,

Sven Sellmer
