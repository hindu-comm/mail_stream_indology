Dear Dominik,

could you elaborate?
I have downloaded the Sanskrit 2003 font from Omkarananda Ashram's homepage, 
where no restriction of any kind was hinted at, and no special prerogatives 
of Ulrich Stiehl were stated.
But I am also interested in the morale of the thing -- is being on this list 
somewhat similar to being a black gay woman?

Yours,
Ferenc
