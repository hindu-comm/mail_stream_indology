In addition to PJ Marshall's excellent "The British Discovery
of Hinduism," one should of course note its companion,
P. Almond's, "The British Discovery of Hinduism"

Frits Staal's anthology on the Sanskrit grammarians
also comes to mind as a work focussed strictly
on Sanskrit studies, the point of departure for all this.
