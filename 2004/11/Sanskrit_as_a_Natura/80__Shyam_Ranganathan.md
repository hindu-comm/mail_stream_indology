Dear Friends and Colleagues

I was wondering if any one could provide me some references to either articles
or books in English on the question of whether Sanskrit was ever a natural,
vernacular language, or whether what we understand as Sanskrit has for the most
part been a formalized language.

I ask because I am interested in the question of whether Sanskrit vocabulary
(particularly in philosophical texts) has displayed more stability in meaning
and function over centuries and millennia, than a language such as English.

Thank you

Shyam
