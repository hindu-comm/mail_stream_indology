Thanks to all who responded with good information about the Vietnamese
dictionaries published in India. My reference client had indicated that he
had already searched WorldCat, so it didn't occur to me to try that again:
hence my plea to the listservs for information. Imagine my surprise (and
embarrassment) to find perfectly good records for the books, and holdings
in many libraries, INCLUDING Columbia! A good lesson for reference
librarians: when patrons say they have searched a database and not found
something, it doesn't mean it's not there!

Thanks again.
David
