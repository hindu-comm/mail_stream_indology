I think we are agreed on the existence of connections if not the exact
details. The original context of this message was whether the IVC was
appropriate for Indology *at all* and my reply should be viewed with
that in mind.

I would be interested in any references you have for those in case I
have missed any.

I think this is an unfair portrayal if you are referring to Possehl,
Kenoyer, Parpola, et. al. I have read most of their "popular" books as
well as their articles in specialist journals (in addition to some
papers prior to publication or that have not yet been published) and I
have always found them to make clear the speculative nature of their
ideas given the incomplete nature of our knowledge about the IVC.

One thing has just become clear to me since reading the FSW paper is the
new split between the "old school" like those mentioned above and those
supporting the Farmer, Witzel, Sproat position.

Congratulations on your publication, by the way. It was
thought-provoking as always and I eagerly look forward to more
discussion in the academic community. Have any linguists weighed in yet?
