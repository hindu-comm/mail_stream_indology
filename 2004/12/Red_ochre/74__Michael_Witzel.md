One has to be very careful in drawing parallels between the Indus Civ.
and later India (as has been pointed out in this thread).

In particular, red/ochre color and powder have been used forever,
apparently to symbolize blood/life: I do not recall the particular
reference (away from my books now), however, red powder was sprinkled
on the bodies of some Neanderthals in at least one burial (may be in N.
Iraq, just in that in which  flowers were laid on the bodies of a
Neanderthal man, Shanidar IV grave, Kurdistan, 60,000 BCE).

In short, "easy, obvious" comparisons, such as between finds of ochre
on prehistoric Pirak/Indus figurines  and the modern use of Sindura in
the partition of women's hair, as done by the former dir. of Indian
Archaeology, B.B. Lal, are facile but simply unprovable.
