Wow, I just read the article. Possehl actually SAID that???
("I don't think his ideas are interesting or viable, and I'm surprised they have raised interest"). 
I am apalled. I disagree with Steve, as everyone will have noticed by now, but his ideas are clearly extremely interesting and not to be taken lightly. 

All the best,
Signe
