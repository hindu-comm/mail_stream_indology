Hello, John!

The address is correct, http://www.indopedia.org - probably your parent
DNS server is not yet updated. The domain has been registered yesterday.
The global propagation takes usually 48-72 hours. It has been already
indexed by some WHOIS servers
http://www.whois.sc/indopedia.org

If using Windows, open Windows/Hosts and add temporarily

67.19.65.133    indopedia.org

Thanks,
Plamen
