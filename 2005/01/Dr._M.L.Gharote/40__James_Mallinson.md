Dear Colleagues,

It is with great sadness that I write to inform you of the death this
morning of Dr. Manohar Laxman Gharote. He worked at the Kaivalyadhama
Yoga Research Centre and then set up the Lonavala Yoga Institute. He
was one of the world's foremost scholars of Sanskrit texts on
ha.thayoga.

Yours,

James Mallinson
