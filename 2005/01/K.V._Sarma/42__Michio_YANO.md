Dear Dominik,

I deleted your message about the sad news of K.V. Sarma
after reading only the subject. Could you please send it
to me again?

I am very sad to hear the news.

I met Prof. Daivid Pingree on his birthday in Providence.
After two operations of the tip of his right foot he cann
not walk freely, but his mind is very active anhd we
had a good time talking about jyosiHzaastra.

Yours with best withes,

Michio
