Because one of our Panelists had to back off for personal reasons, we are
looking for another speaker on Hinduism for our Panel 'Discourses on War
and Violence in Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism' at the IAHR Wordl
Conference in Tokyo on the 26.3.2005. If anyone is interested please
contact me or Ronit Tlalim: rt19 at hotmail.com.
