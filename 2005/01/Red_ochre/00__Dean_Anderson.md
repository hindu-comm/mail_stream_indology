Matthew, I read the work you cited and found it very interesting.

Can anyone refer me to works that discuss the origins of sinduura and
what it symbolizes in India? Or of the use of red ochre in general
across the various cultures?

Do Buddhist texts specify why it is consecrated to the .daakinii?

Best,

Dean
