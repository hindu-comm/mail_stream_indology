UTF-8 देवनागरी works, too.  Amazing.  I've come across 
http://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/  (Sanskrit version of Wikipedia) that 
way.

Devanāgarī search works with regular google.  I should have expected 
this, since google has always accepted utf-8.  This is just a Sanskrit 
interface, like Japanese, Dutch, etc.  Still, very funny on google's 
part :)
