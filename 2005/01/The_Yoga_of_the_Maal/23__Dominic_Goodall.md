and is available from the French Institute of Pondicherry 
(<http://www.ifpindia.org/pubs.html>) or through Motilal Banarsidass.

The Yoga of the Mâlinîvijayottaratantra,
Chapters 1-4, 7, 11-17.
Critical edition, Translation and Notes.
by Somadeva VASUDEVA.
Pondicherry, Institut Français de Pondichéry/ Ecole française 
dExtrême-Orient, 2004.
Collection Indologie 97.
liv+561pp. Indian Rupees 700.

Herein is presented the first detailed investigation into the yogic 
teachings of the Mâlinîvijayottaratantra, a Saiva Tantra of the Trika 
commented on extensively by the celebrated Kashmirian philosopher 
Abhinavagupta (9-10th century AD).
But it is also a major contribution to the as yet little studied field of 
Saiva yoga.
The Sanskrit source text (Mâlinîvijayottara 14, 7, and 1217) has been 
critically edited from the Kashmirian manuscripts that are today accessible.

The edition is prefaced by a description of the manuscripts used and the 
editorial policies followed. A running commentary adds further explanatory 
material, parallel passages from related Saiva Tantras (many unpublished) 
and attempts to tackle problems raised by Abhinavaguptas exegesis.
