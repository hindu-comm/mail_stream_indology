I'd recommend the DICT (http://www.dict.org/links.html) version at:

 http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/mw_dict/mw_dict.html

To use it under Mac OSX you will need to install DICTatoro:

 http://www.ropersonline.com/dict/

I flagged this version some while back:

 http://homepages.comnet.co.nz/~r-mahoney/mw_dict/mw_DICT_notify

The DICT version should be useful for those using Mac OSX, or a UNIX or
UNIX-like system. It enables one to search for a number of head words at
the same time using various strategies:

Strategies available:
 exact      Match headwords exactly
 prefix     Match prefixes
 substring  Match substring occurring anywhere in a headword
 suffix     Match suffixes
 re         POSIX 1003.2 (modern) regular expressions
 regexp     Old (basic) regular expressions
 soundex    Match using SOUNDEX algorithm
 lev        Match headwords within Levenshtein distance one
 word       Match separate words within headwords


Best regards,

 Richard
