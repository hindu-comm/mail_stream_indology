Dear Greg Bailey,

vratabandha is - in Nepal - a common synononym for upanayana: See my article
"Der verstoßene Sohn. Nepalische baalyogis und der deSaatanta-Ritus während
der Inititaion", in: B. Koelver (ed.), Formen kulturellen Wandels und andere
Beiträge zur Erforschung des Himalaya. Sankt Augustin: VGH
Wissenschaftsverlag, 1986, 189-224, which includes an edition and (German)
translation of a Vratabandhapaddhati as well as some elaborations on that
term and references to other manuscripts and publications.

If you have difficulties in getting a copy, do not hesitate to let it me
know: I can send you an off-print.

Best,
Axel Michaels
