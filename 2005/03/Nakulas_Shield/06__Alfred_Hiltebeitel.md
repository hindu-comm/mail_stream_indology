Though I cannot answer your question, the observation is certainly
interesting and reminds me of my surprise in finding the demon-name
Asiloman at DM 2.42 when I was looking for an etymology for the name
(with variations Aciloman, Acalamman, AcampAlAcuran, and Rocakan) of
the "demon of the Cenci (Gingee) Fort" who makes trouble for the Tamil
goddess Draupadi. In each case it is a matter of "sword"-names, which
might suggest that these circulate with special interest.
