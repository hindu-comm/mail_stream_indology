Is there any evidence whether these are crescent moons or full moons
(e.g. silver bosses)?

Are other warriors mentioned as having different cognizances on their
shields?

In MBh 2((28)66.14 Nakula is said to take up his sword and shield with
the
eight moons. A seemingly identical shield is found in the Devī
Māhātmya 9:12
Niśumbha is found to wield an identical shield. Is there a
connection
between the two sets of twins?

Thank you in advance.
