Colleagues,

we have just learned from an English language source that the gesture
mad by a Buddha or a teacher during a ritual is called the
"prediction of enlightenment." it occurs when the teacher displays
abhaya mudraa with his right hand and holds the hem of his robe with
the left (ur.na mudraa).

Does any one know the Sanskrit for the combined gesture or for the
prediction of enlightenment?

thank you

JOhn
