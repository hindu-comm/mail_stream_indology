Dear Arlo,

While I cannot give you much useful technical advice, an excellent
contact to have would be Dr. Robert Cribb, now of the Australian
National University (formerly at UQ). Dr. Cribb is the author and
illustrator of "A Historical Atlas of Indonesia" (2000) and is quite a
skilled cartographer in his spare time.

His details are:

robert.cribb at anu.edu.au
Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies
Australian National University

Best wishes,

Antonio Ferreira-Jardim
PhD Candidate
University of Queensland
