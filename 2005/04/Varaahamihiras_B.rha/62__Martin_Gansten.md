> A colleague from outside Indology has approached me for information about
>the date of Varaahamihira's B.rhatsa.mhitaa.  Any bibliographical advice
>would be very welcome.

Pingree's _Jyotihsastra: Astral and Mathematical Literature_ (Wiesbaden,
1981) is the place to look. Varahamihira flourished in the 6th century.
