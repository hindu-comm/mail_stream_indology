In addition to this, there is also the entry on VarAhamihira in
Dictionary of Scientific Biography (vol. XIII, pp. 581-3).  The entry
on VarAhamihira in Census of the Exact Sciences in Sanskrit (series A,
vol. 5, pp. 563-95) has information and bibliography on both
VarAhamihira and the BRhatsaMhitA.

Best wishes,
Toke
