> Deha/dehin seems to be a fairly common binary pair

Isn't it interesting that as a matter of fact Atma is the dehin, while the videhin is by no means the Purusa. :-)

If we take mind to be the manas as etymology of mens requires, then in most systems, there is no mind-body problem because mind itself is a material substance (or prakriti with the rest of the manifestations of citta, while Atman though cit, is not citta).
