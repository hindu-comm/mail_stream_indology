Dear members,

following this thread I take the advantage to ask a side question, namely if
anybody is familiar with the term "saMsarga" applied to the body?

I assume this usage in the SatyazAsanaparIkSA of the Jaina VidyAnandin which
in the context of the discussion of NyAya-VaizeSika hands down a verse where
saMsarga is counted as an element of the 21-fold duHkha:
saMsargau sukhaduHkhe ca tathArthendriyabuddhayaH |
pratyekaM SaDvidhAz ceti duHkhasaMkhyaikaviMzatiH || (Edition of Calcutta
1964)

>â€‰From parallel material in the NyAyavArttika it is clear that saMsarga here
has to be understood as a term for the body:
ekaviMzatiprabhedabhinnaM punar duHkham: *zarIraM* SaDindriyANi SaDviSayAH
SaDbuddhayaH sukhaM duHkhaM ceti. (Edition of Calcutta 1934ff)

Are there any other contexts where the body is called "saMsarga"?

Thank you very much for your help
