Maybe BACSA (British Association for Cemeteries in South Asia) has something on him in its printed works, considering Omar has given us his place of burial.

George Michell, architect and author asked me this question, and I provided 
Marrett's life span as given in List of Inscriptions on Tombs or Monuments 
in the Nizam's Dominion, by O.S. Crofton, Hyderabad, 1941. Marrett lies 
buried in Hyderabad as listed in the Crofton book. The other person who may 
know is Alison Mackenzie, PhD student at UPenn/History Dept. No one in 
Hyderabad, Deccan seems to know about him beyond identifying him as the 
engineer of the PWD.
