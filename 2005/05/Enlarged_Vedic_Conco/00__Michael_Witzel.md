This is to let you know that Dr. Marco Franceschini has finalized his
work on additions to Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance, (C) HUP and M.F.,
2005.

The new version includes some 20,000 additional Mantras (with many
corrections)  from Paippalada-Samhita (books 1-15), Jaiminiya-Brahmana,
Katha-Aranyaka, Manava-Srautasutra, Jaiminiya-Grhyasutra and
Varaha-Grhyasutra,  in a 7 - 9 MB file.

In compressed form (Mac and PC), it is downloadable from the University
website at Bologna
http://www.dslo.unibo.it/iniz.html

and in its Mac version also from mine:

Our warm thanks to Marco Franceschini for making his painstaking work
available to the scholarly community!
