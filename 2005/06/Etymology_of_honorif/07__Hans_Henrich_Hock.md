Yes, it is accepted; and it has a beautiful counterpart in 
Urdu and Persian _jaan_, also meaning 'life' as well as 
being used as an honorific/term of endearment.  The Hindi 
(etc.) _jii_ might well be a calque of the Persian word.  
The root is also contained in Hindi _jii-naa_ 'to live'.

Cheers-ji,

Hans Henrich Hock
