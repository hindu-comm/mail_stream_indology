Thanks for the correction. Madhav Deshpande had already provided the working
URL. I have looked over the new reconstruction and find it very interesting,
to my mind an important improvement in many places over the text
used/imagined by Hattori. Thank you for making this available.

Best wishes,
Dan Lusthaus
