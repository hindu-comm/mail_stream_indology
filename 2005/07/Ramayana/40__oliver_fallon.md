There are some excellent studies of the language of the Ramayana:

Oberlies, T. 2003 'Grammar of Epic Sanskrit'. Indian Philology and South Asian Studies, vol. 5.Berlin/New York, Walter de Gruyter.

Satya Vrat. 1964 The Ramayana - a Linguistic Study. Delhi, Munshiram Manoharlal.

Michelson 1904 Linguistic Archaisms of the Ramayana. Journal of the American Oriental Society 25: pp89-145

I hope these help.
