Yes, in fact if one checks on descriptions of the attributes of gorgeous 
women in the classics, she who walks like an elephant or a goose could 
easily have been of that overly zaftig build--in some descriptions her 
breasts are so heavy that they pull her shoulders down ~~:  and she has 
difficulty running away from male pursuers. But then, elephants are said to 
be fast runners.

When my mother and aunt stayed with me in Pune for a week back in 1983, they 
remarked about my Tamil maid, a woman of full figure approaching middle age, 
"She walks like she were Queen Mary."  I think the poets with their talk of 
geese and elephants were referring to something of the sort.
