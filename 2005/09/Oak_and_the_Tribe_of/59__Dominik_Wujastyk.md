As is well known, 'Shaakya' is a patronymic, meaning 'descendent of 
Shaka'.  The word 'Shaka' is a proper name, referring to the tribe, and 
may not have a Sanskrit etymology. Nothing points to an oak tree.  Since 
'shaka' also means the same as 'shak.rt', one probably doesn't want to go 
further into etymologizing the Buddha's title.
