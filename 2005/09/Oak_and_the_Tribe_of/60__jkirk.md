>>>Dear list members,

>>>Here's a quotation from the new book _Oak:  The Frame
>>>of Civilization_, by William Bryant Logan, Norton, 2005,
>>>page 24:
>>>
>>>'The name of the historic Buddha, Shakyamuni, means
>>>"the sage of the oak tree people".'
>>>
>>>This surprised me, and I haven't been able to find any
>>>corroboration on the internet or in my library.  I'm not
>>>an expert on Pali or Sanskrit, so I can't judge the
>>>accuracy of this statement.  The book is not a scholarly
>>>volume, so there aren't footnotes  -- otherwise I'd just
>>>look at his references and I might have my answer already.
>>>
>>>Was the Shakya tribe/clan really named after oak trees?
>>>
>>>Sincerely,
>>>
>>>Greg Bungo
