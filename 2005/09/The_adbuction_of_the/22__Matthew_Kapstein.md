It would be helpful if you would provide a bit more
context -- when and where does your citation come from?

In any event, although the word padminii is not used,
the first story in K.semendra's Avadaanakalpalataa
concerns a lust-maddened bull-elephant wreaking havoc
while chasing down a female in heat. Perhaps something
like this is the reference intended?
