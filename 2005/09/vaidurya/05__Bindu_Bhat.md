Dan,
I think it is Cat's eye (Chrysoberyl). It is also known as Sutramani
or Lahsunia. It is the stone for planet Ketu (i.e. Dragon's tail).
Bindu
Quoting Dan Lusthaus <vasubandhu at EARTHLINK.NET>:

> I'm wondering if someone on list can help me better identify a
> gem: vaiá¸Å«rya
> (vai.duurya or vaiDUrya). Monier-Williams gives only a "cat's-eye
> gem." The
> Chinese corresponding term in Buddhist texts is not univocal --
> sometimes
> believed to be lapis lazuli, sometimes beryl, sometimes other
> things. Does
> this term have a single referent in Sanskrit, or did it apply to
> different
> gems at different times and places in India?
>
> Thank you in advance.
