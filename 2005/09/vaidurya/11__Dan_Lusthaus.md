Someone else has brought to my attention that Cunningham, describing what he
found at the third Stupa at Sanchi, reports on the seven precious items
entombed there, and the vai.duulya was lapis lazuli. Are those items still
preserved and available somewhere? Has anyone checked recently to determine
whether it really was lapis lazuli or beryl?

Thanks.

I promise this will be the last time I post on query on this topic.
