Re: Matthew Kapstein's observation on the connection of Zaakya with zak:

  Vinayak
udrakavastu (Derge Kanjur 6, 'dul ba, da 202a5-b4; sTog 
Kanjur 6, 'dul ba, tha 299b6-300b1), not very poetically:

Then the Blessed One spoke to the young brahmin Ómra saying: "Young 
brahmin, long ago there appeared a king named Ák
våku Sujåta, and 
King Ák
våku Sujåta had four sons: Ulkåmukha, Karakar¥, 
Hastikaniya×sa, and N¨pura." Having been banished by King Ák
våku 
Sujåta because of some offence, they led their own full sisters and 
went to another land, and arriving there, in due order they came 
before too very long to the abode of Kapila on the bank of the river 
Bhag¥rath¥ in the region of the Himalaya. And they dwelt there having 
built huts from branches and leaves of trees. Then, avoiding their 
full sisters, they cohabited with their agnatic half-sisters.Then 
remaing there [for some time], sons and daughters were born. Then at 
some later time King Ák
våku Sujåta recalled his beloved sons, and 
spoke to his ministers, saying: "Peasants, where are my sons?" "Lord, 
thanks to some transgression, they were banished, and taking their 
own full sisters, they went to another land, and arriving there, in 
due order [they settled] on the bank of the river Bhag¥rath¥ in the 
region of the Himalaya, where they dwell having given birth to sons 
and daughters." Then King Ák
våku Sujåta spoke to his minsters 
saying: "Peasants, were my sons able to do alright?" "Lord, they were 
able." Then King Ák
våku Sujåta was pleased, and stretching out his 
right hand he uttered a joyous proclamation: "Well, my sons were 
capable!" Because a distinguished person stated "Well, my sons were 
capable," they are famous under the name Íåkya, the Able Ones.
