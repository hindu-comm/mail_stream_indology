Allen: the only good and accurate translation is by Kangle. His 
three-volume work originally published by the University of Bombay 
has recently been reprintd by Motilal. Try to keep him from the 
Penguin translation by Rangarajan, who has not training in the field 
(his degree was in Physics and he was a foreign service officer) and 
has also mutilated the text by shifting passages around.
