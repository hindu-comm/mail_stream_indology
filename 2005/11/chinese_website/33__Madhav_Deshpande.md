Yesterday I downloaded a 200+ mb file "fahua.rar" from this website, but I have no idea what program will open this ".rar" file.  Any suggestions?

Dear colleagues,

The following website of the Chinese "Research Institute of Sanskrit 
manuscripts & and Buddhist Literature" has just been brought to my 
attention: <http://sfl.pku.edu.cn/sanskrit/>. It may not be an 
evident destination for non-Buddhologists, and that is why I mention 
it here on INDOLOGY, because it offers several collections of 
materials that may be of rather broad utility (e.g. ak.sara lists 
for ;Saaradaa and Nepalese Post-Gupta scripts from two old mss., a 
Khotanese page under construction).
