Dear colleagues,

The following website of the Chinese "Research Institute of Sanskrit  
manuscripts & and Buddhist Literature" has just been brought to my  
attention: <http://sfl.pku.edu.cn/sanskrit/>. It may not be an  
evident destination for non-Buddhologists, and that is why I mention  
it here on INDOLOGY, because it offers several collections of  
materials that may be of rather broad utility (e.g. ak.sara lists  
for ;Saaradaa and Nepalese Post-Gupta scripts from two old mss., a  
Khotanese page under construction).
