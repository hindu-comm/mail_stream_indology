>The following website of the Chinese "Research Institute of Sanskrit
>manuscripts & and Buddhist Literature" has just been brought to my
>attention: <http://sfl.pku.edu.cn/sanskrit/>. It may not be an
>evident destination for non-Buddhologists, and that is why I mention
>it here on INDOLOGY, because it offers several collections of
>materials that may be of rather broad utility (e.g. ak.sara lists
>for ;Saaradaa and Nepalese Post-Gupta scripts from two old mss., a
>Khotanese page under construction).
