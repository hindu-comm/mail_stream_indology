I would guess it might be:

kalau t.r.m"sasahasraa.ni vi.s.nus ti.s.thati medinyaa.m bhuutale vaa

But that is unmetrical, hence maybe emend to:

kalau tri.m"sasahasraa.ni vi.s.nus ti.s.thati bhuutale

meaning: "In the Kali [era] Vishnu will remain on earth for thirty  
thousand [years only?]"

regards,

Somadeva Vasudeva
