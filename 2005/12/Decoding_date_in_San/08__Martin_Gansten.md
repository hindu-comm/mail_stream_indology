Thank you. The meaning 'five' was my first guess, although I rejected it,
largely because no tithi is normally called pancadasi (the tithi after
caturdasi being either purnima or amavasya). My idea, however, was that
this meaning would be derived from the astrological meaning of the fifth
house of a horoscope (pancama-sthana = putra-sthana, etc), not from the
number of Pandavas.
