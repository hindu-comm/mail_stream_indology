Subject: Punjabi or Hindustani slurs on British?


A film-maker is doing a film on the Komagatu Maru incident (the turning back 
of a ship of Indian immigrant farm workers from Vancouver, BC in 1914).  She 
needs to know what slurs, slang, or derogatory words the Indians involved 
would have applied to the  British or to the employees of the Immigration 
offices.  I already suggested Ferenghi and Gora (log), but does anyone know 
any others?

Thanks,

Allen Thrasher
