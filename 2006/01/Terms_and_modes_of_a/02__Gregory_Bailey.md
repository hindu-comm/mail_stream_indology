Dear Sven,

There is a book written by N.K. Wagle and published in 1965, I think.  I cannot remember the title but it contains a detailed analysis of names of the Buddha when he is being addressed by people from different classes.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey

Dear Colleagues!

Does anybody know of good books and articles dealing with modes and terms of address in Sanskrit?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
