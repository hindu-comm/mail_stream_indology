I am somewhat surprised that the advertised Sanskrit courses do not seem to
qualify students to take Intermediate or Advanced Sanskrit in Canada. Or do
you believe that Canada is just one of the United States? (The latter
happens frequently - Ronald Reagan called Canada "Acidrainia - a totally
owned US subsidiary").
