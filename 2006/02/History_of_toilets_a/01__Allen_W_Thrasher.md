"I dont think human waste had otherwise been considered anything 'evil' 
to be caste-off on to someone else. In India, the old, sick and infirm 
have always been cared for in the homes, and family members gave/give 
care, including handling their waste. The only thing family members 
will not do on their own is cremation of their dead."

Yes, but the eliminatory products of members of one's own family are of the same substance as one's own and of oneself, and are therefore far less defiling than those of outsiders.
