Dear Indologists.

There will be a Memorial Service for David Pingree Friday, March 17 at 
10 a.m. in Manning Chapel on the Main Campus of Brown University.

All are invited to lunch after the service and to stay on to attend the 
Ancient Studies Conference on "Geography, Ethnography, and Perception 
of the World from Antiquity to the Renaissance" at the Brown Inn from 
March 17-19.

Sincerely,
Toke Lindegaard Knudsen
