This second statement is not accurate.  Professor Ruzsa was informed 
that "it was judged that the subject matter of your abstract "Is the 
Cosmic Giant an IE myth?" was not sufficiently relevant to the concerns 
of a World Sanskrit Conference to be suitable for presentation at the 
13th WSC; had we been organising a conference of Indo-European studies 
we would no doubt have welcomed it warmly (it is an indication of its 
nature that the only reference in your abstract was to Bruce Lincoln's 
Myth, Cosmos and Society)."

Professor Ruzsa is of course still welcome to attend the conference like 
anyone else.
