Friends,

I beg your forgiveness: I know this does not really belong here, but I was 
addressed personally, so I cannot avoid answering.

It is. I quote in full the e-mail I received (06.02):

Dear Dr Ruzsa

We regret to inform you that your Abstract “Is The Cosmic Giant an IE Myth?' 
, having been examined by the Chairpersons, is not considered to be suitable 
for presentation at the 13thWorld Sanskrit Conference.   We as organisers of 
the conference concur in their assessment.


Yours sincerely




Professor John Brockington (Chair)
Paul Dundas (Secretary)

And I noted in my first posting already (directly under the line that Prof. 
Brockington referred to above) that
>3. After inquiry for the ground of the decision in e-mail I was told that 
>"the subject matter ... was not sufficiently relevant to the concerns of a 
>World Sanskrit Conference."

*****
Please, Naiyaayikas of the e-world! I have not received any feedback on my 
abstract on Nyaaya (posted 17.02); but it would be quite important for me to 
know if it really does not contain any new idea. So please, send me the name 
of the relevant book or article that has a similar view on old inference so 
that I may update my knowledge. Otherwise (this is a threat) I will write it 
in full...

Thank you,
Ferenc Ruzsa
