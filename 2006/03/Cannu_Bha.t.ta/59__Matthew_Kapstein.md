I have recently noticed that in his introduction to
K. Klostermaier's trans. of ch. 16 of the Sarvadars'anasa.mgraha
(Adyar 1999), K. Kunjunni Raja affirms the argument of Ananthalal
Thakur (that appeared in the Adyar Library Bull. vol. 25) 
that one Cannu Bha.t.ta and not Saaya.na Maadhava was the
real author of the SDS. Do any of the kind
readers of the list know of additional critical
discussion of this re-attribution, or have any further information
to bring to bear upon the question?
