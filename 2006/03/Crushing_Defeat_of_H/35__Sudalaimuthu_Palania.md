I tell  my 
undergraduates that, while there are certainly many "gods" in that  
complex family of religious traditions that we have labeled  
"Hinduism," for any given Hindu, there is one and only one supreme  
being. 


This is a categorical statement that is not defensible. Certainly,  this was 
not true of my family tradition in which I grew up.
