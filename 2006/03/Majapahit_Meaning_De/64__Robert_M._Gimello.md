I think the term "Majapahit" is not Sanskritic in origin. I seem to  
recall having read somewhere that it was originally the name of the  
village that, at the turn 14th century, became the capital city of  
the new E. Java empire so named, and that the meaning of the word was  
something like "bitter fruit."
