I know that at one time there was an Indic list-serve for Unicode 
concerns (http://www.unicode.org/~emuller/iwg/) but it's current 
status is unclear.

On a related note, however, I have been encoding some Sanskrit text 
in unicode and have been unable to locate the equivalent of a 
headline ellipsis in the Devanagari range (0900-097F) or under 
"General Punctuation" (2000-206F).  Can someone tell me if this has 
been encoded in a non-obvious manner or as a variant form of another 
glyph?  Otherwise, this would appear to be another candidate for 
addition to the standard.
