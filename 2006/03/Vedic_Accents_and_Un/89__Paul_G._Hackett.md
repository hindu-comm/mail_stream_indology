This may be true, but such an approach would not conform to the 
principles of Unicode, since the standard aims at encoding characters 
(abstract linguistic components) and not glyphs (surface / appearance 
forms).  See:

http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr17/#CharactersVsGlyphs

FYI, early versions of the standard did encode some composite forms, 
but these have since been deprecated.
