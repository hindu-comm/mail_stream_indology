A couple of questions for the experts:

1. I should appreciate it, if some one could help with the rendering of this 
passage:

sobhane hastanakshatre grahasaumye subhe ravau/
purvahne brahma.nair yukta√æ pariksheta vicaksha.na.h//

2. Any information on a sm.rtinibandha: Jaganmohana composed by 
Srilakshma.nacarya Bha.t.ta

Many thanks,
Ken
