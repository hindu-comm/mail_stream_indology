     Can any one help me in finding the meaning
 
Dear Collegues,

     Can any one help me in finding the meaning of the word "Venkita". 
The word is used all over south india associated with many sanskrit terms like Esvara (Venkitesvara). I think the word is a dravidic one. 

With regards,

Dr. Anand
