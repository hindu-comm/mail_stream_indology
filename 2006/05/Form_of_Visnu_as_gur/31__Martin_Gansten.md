The closest Vaishnava parallel to Dakshinamurti is probably Hayagriva,
considered as jnanamurti and Vedamurti and typically depicted with one of
his four hands displaying the jnanamudra and another holding a book (Veda).
He is especially popular in South India, among the Sri Vaishnavas and
Madhvas. I am not aware of any scholarly works specifically on Hayagriva,
but for web sites, see:
