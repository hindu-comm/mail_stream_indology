Greetings,
Thankyou all for your helpful information. Hayagriva sounds like the form
referred to. The verse offers salutations to Sriguruvisnu, the abode of
moksalaksmi, the conqueror of the cruel Madhu and Kaitabha, personifications
of pride and delusion. 

Hayagriva sounds an interesting deity in that it is also worshipped by
Buddhists. Thankyou Martin for the excellent web-site.

I would be very happy to receive any further information on Hayagriva.

much appreciated,
Jenni
