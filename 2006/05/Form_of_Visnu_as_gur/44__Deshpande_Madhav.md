Hello Jenni,

     The prime-time form of Visnu as a Guru is that of Krishna as the teacher of Arjuna.  This form, normally called pArthasArathi, is widely worshipped especially in South India.  I typed 'Parthasarathi' on Google image search, and several temple photos showed up.

Subject: Form of Visnu as guru

Greetings,

Daksinamurti is the form of Siva as guru. Can anyone please enlighten me
about a form (murti) of Visnu as guru? Is there a particular sampradaya that
worships Visnu in this form? Are there any good books/papers/web-sites etc.
on this subject?

Thankyou,
