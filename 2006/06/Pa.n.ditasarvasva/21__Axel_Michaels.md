Dear Arlo,

I just remember the title vagely from my work on the "Pandit", but I 
don't think the text has ever been edited. Look 
http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/S_0079.HTM, where you find other 
titels of Halayudha Misra mentioned, such as /Brahmanasarvasva/, 
/Mimamsasarvasva/, /Vaisnavasarvasva/ and /Shaivasarvasva.

/Perhaps Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya, "Halayudha and his works", PAIOC 
17, Summaries 1953, 4 might be helpful.

Good luck,
Axel
