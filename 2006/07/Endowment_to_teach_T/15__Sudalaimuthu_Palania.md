Dear Scholars,

In his book, "A History of South India", (Oxford, University Press, Seventh  
Impression, 1987, p. 320), K. A. Nilakanta Sastri refers to an endowment to  
teach Tamil, Marathi, and Prakrit in the schools in Kuntala. He does not cite  
any reference to the inscription or copper plate authorizing this grant. Does  
anybody know references to the grant on which Sastri is basing his  statement?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
S. Palaniappan
