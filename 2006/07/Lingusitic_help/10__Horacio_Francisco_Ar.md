Respectable colleagues: 
I am looking for the help of the linguists, because years ago, a Hindu commented me that the word guruu means certain animal in the indian languages and as the Spaniards they have cared this word in his language to refer to the word guru. Does some of you know on these meanings? 
Sincerely
Professor Horacio Francisco Arganis J.
Researcher of U A de C, IEFAC and IBCH
