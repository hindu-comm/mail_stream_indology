I don't know, but one place I would think of looking is

   booktitle    = {Love in {South Asia}: A Cultural
                   History},
   editor       = {Francesca Orsini},
   series       = {University Of Cambridge Oriental
                   Publications},
   volume       = 62,
   publisher    = cup,
   address      = {Cambridge},
   issn         = {0068-6891},
   isbn         = 0521856787,
   year         = 2006,


Best,
Dominik
