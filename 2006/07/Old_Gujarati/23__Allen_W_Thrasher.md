I don't think Stanley Insler of Yale is on the list, but he has, I believe, worked on Old Gujarati.  Phyllis Granoff is another.

Hello,

I was wondering if there is someone on the list  who works on Old Gujarati
Jaina texts and who would be willing to help me with accurate translations
for
a few  sentences from the SaDaavazyakabaalaavabodhavRtti of taruNaprabha.
 I need to use these sentences with glosses  as examples of some
linguistic  phenomena. Alternately, if a
translation is available, I would be grateful for the reference.

Thanks,

Ashwini Deo
