A lot of university libraries are scanning many tables of contents, which would pull in a lot of what you want.  I don't think anyone is doing it in a consolidated database, though.  My institution now often has a link to online tables of contents provided by the publisher, as well as to the publisher's biographical sketch of the author.

What I'd like to know, and please pardon me if I should know but don't:
is there any online library database that lists the titles of book chapters 
and of titles & authors in anthologies?
