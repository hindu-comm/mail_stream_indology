Dear george,

  I cannot identify the language and script but I can tell you that  
the material is not palm leaf. It is a thin cloth with some sort of  
thick black sizing on it. The gold letters are then written on the  
black sizing.  The structure can be seen very clearly in the fold of  
the second item you have posted. This technique may have implications  
in dating the manuscript.

I hope tis helps

John
