Dear George,

My Pali contact has this to say:

> It isn't Burmese, the script is Lao ("Lao-Tham"/"Lao-Dhamma"), which
> effectively means that it comes from no further west than Northern
> Thailand (i.e., it certainly doesn't look Shan).

>  It also doesn't look very old --notwithstanding the holes bored away
> by the termites. I would presume it's of entirely modern origin.

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
