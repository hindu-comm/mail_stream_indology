There is no problem using Sanskrit diacritics in Endnote (at least  
not on a Mac). Problems may arise, however, if you are downloading  
records from the Library of Congress or any other library catalog  
that goes through the LoC gateway. It seems that the LoC gateway does  
not yet support UTF-8.

Two alternatives to Endnote that may be of use to Mac users are  
Bookends and Sente. Both of these handle Sanskrit (and other CJK)  
diacritics with ease, and are much cheaper than Endnote.

Kindest regards,
