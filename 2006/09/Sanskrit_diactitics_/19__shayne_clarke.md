Dear Lars Martin Fosse (and other interested list members),

I do not, as a rule, use Endnote, but I have tried the demo version  
of Endnote X (just released a few weeks ago) and can confirm that  
there seem to be no problems with Sanskrit diacritics. I usually use  
the Gentium font (with Asian Extended UK as a keyboard input). I hope  
this helps.

Kindest regards,
Shayne Clarke
