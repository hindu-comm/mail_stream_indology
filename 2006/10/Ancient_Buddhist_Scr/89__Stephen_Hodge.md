Dear Stephen,

the Dhoṇa sūtra has since been edited by Mark Allon in:

   Mark Allon, 2001.  Three Gāndhārī Ekottarikāgama‐type sūtras:
   British Library Kharoṣṭhī fragments 12 and 14.  Seattle:
   University of Washington Press. (Gandhāran Buddhist texts,
   volume 2.)

   http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/ALLTHR.html

I’ll send you the edited text and the translation (three pages)
offlist later today.

Best wishes,
Stefan
