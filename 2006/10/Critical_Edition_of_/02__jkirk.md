You might try contacting the Ames Library at U Minnesota to see if they have 
it, or to ask how to get in touch with the MS University in Baroda's 
Oriental Inst. I tried getting some listed websites at MSU to no avail.

Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda
http://www.msub.edu [these links get 404s]
  Maharajah Sayajirao Gaekwad established Baroda College in 1880 and a 
succession of additional institutions of higher education followed over the 
next 50 years, including the famed Oriental Institute. In 1949 these 
institutions were brought together as the M.S. University of Baroda. Site 
gives a history of the university, academic departments, administions 
procedures, etc.
