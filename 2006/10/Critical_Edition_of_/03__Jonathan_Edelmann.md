Dear All,

I am looking to purchase a critical edition of the Bhagavata Purana.

Ludo Rocher mentions in his study of the Puranas (1986) that a  
critical edition of it may be under way at the University of  
Gujerat.  Does anyone know if that happened or is happening?

I've also heard there is a critical edition of the BP published in  
Baroda.  Does anyone have a reference, or know how it can be obtained  
(aside from going to Baroda!).

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
