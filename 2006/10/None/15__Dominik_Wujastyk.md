There's a new scheme for bringing scholars from South Asia to Britain as 
research fellows:

"British Academy and the ESRC announce new Visiting Fellowship 
collaboration

The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the British Academy 
have today announced a new joint scheme to fund Visiting Fellowships from 
South Asia and the Middle East.

The fellowships, which will be a minimum of two months in duration, aim to 
attract early-career researchers particularly from South Asia and the 
Middle East to collaborate on research. It is also hoped that through 
these Visiting Fellowships longer term plans for collaborative research 
could be developed."


Maximum grant £12,000 (i.e., FEC £15,000). Closing date for applications: 
15 November 2006, for visits from 4/07-3/08. Applicants must have obtained 
their doctorates after 1 January 2001.
