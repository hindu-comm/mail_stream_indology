Palaniappan and all: the Vajrasuuci is actually a Buddhist polemical 
text ascribed to Asvaghosa, but probably much later, perhaps in the 
6th century. So, this is not a Brahmanical position, but a Buddhist 
satirical comment on the so-called purity of Brahmins by showing that 
even Vyaasa had a problematic parentage.
