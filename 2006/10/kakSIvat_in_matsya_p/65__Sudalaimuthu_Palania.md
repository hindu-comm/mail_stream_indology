Dear Indologists,

J. Muir in his "Original Sanskrit texts on the Origin and Progress of the  
Religion and Institutions of India", vol 1, p. 279 is supposed to describe a  
matsya purANa passage with the list of Rg Vedic brAhmaNa RSis including  
kakSIvat. I do not have access to Muir's book. I would appreciate any  
details/reference of the Matsya Purana passage.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
S. Palaniappan
