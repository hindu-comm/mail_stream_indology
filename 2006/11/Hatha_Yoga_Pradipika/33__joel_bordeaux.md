Hello.  I'm wondering if any of the Sanskrit Hatha Yoga Pradipika  
commentaries other than Brahmananda's have been edited and, if so,  
where one might find them.

Rumor has it that Umapati, who I'm assuming is the 14th cent author  
of Shivaprakasham, wrote one, as did Ramananda/Advaita Tirtha, who  
seems to have lived in Andhra mid 18th cent.

Other names I've seen are Mahadeva and Vrajabhusana (Mishra?), about  
whom I am unable even to speculate.

Thanks,
