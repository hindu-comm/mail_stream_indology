In recent years, M. L. Gharote edited several works on or 
around the Hatha(yoga)pradipika. See, e.g., the web site 
of the Lonavla Yoga Institute 
(http://www.lonavalayoga.org/publications.html)

Among these you will find:

- _Hathapradipika (with 10 chapters) of Svatmarama and 
Yogaprakasika commentary by Balakrsna_ / ed. by M. L. 
Gharote ; Parimal Devnath. - Lonavla : The Lonavla Yoga 
Institute, 2001. - ISBN 81-901176-6-1

- _Hatharatnavali (a treatise on hathayoga) of 
Srinivasayogi_ / critically ed. by M. L. Gharote [et al.]. 
- Lonavla : The Lonavla Yoga Institute, 2002. - ISBN 
81-901176-9-6

There is also a Hathapradipikavrtti in Marathi by a 
certain Bhojatmaja. In the Rajasthan Puratan Granthmala, 
M. L. Gharote published a Hindi treatise inspired by the 
Hathapradipika:

- Jayatarama krta Jogapradipika / samp.: Em. El. Gharote. 
- Jodhpur : Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute, 1999 
(Rajasthana Puratana Granthamala ; 192) [main text in 
Hindi,  introduction in English]

In 1989, Gharote brought out together with V. A. Bedekar: 
_A descriptive catalogue of Yoga manuscripts_. - Lonavla : 
The Kaivalyadhama S. M. Y. M. Samiti, 1989. Despite the 
title it is a tabular listing of mss. The "descriptive" 
part is rather small, if existing at all.

Hope it helps
