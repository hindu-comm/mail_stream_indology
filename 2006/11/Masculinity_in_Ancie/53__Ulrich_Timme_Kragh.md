I would recommend you to take a look at "Conjugal Love in India: Ratisastra and
Ratiramana: Text, Translation and Notes" by Kenneth G. Zysk, Brill 2002. This
book contains many explanations on physical signs considered auspicious in
either the male or female bodies, especially in terms of marriage and
fertility. Although the Sanskrit texts studied here are later than the period
you specified, the general tradition of physiognomy can be traced back to the
period you are interested in.

With best wishes,
Tim
