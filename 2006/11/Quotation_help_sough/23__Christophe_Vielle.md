Dear Stephen Hodge,
It is obvious that it does not come from the early vaayuprokta B.dP (viz. =
VaaP).
Since on my side I try to list all the quotations from the B.dP,  I find
yours among Madhva's possible "false" quotations (cf. the work by
Mesquita), viz. at BhaagTN (p. 19, 12-14):

mohanaartha.m daanavaanaa.m baalaruupii pathi sthita.h |
putra.m ta.m kalpayaam aasa muu.dhabuddhir jana.h svayam ||
tata.h sa.mmohayaam aasa jinaadyaan asuraa.m/sakaan |
bhagavaan vaagbhir ugraabhir ahi.msaavaacibhir hari.h ||

I would be interested to know where you found it.
Yours,
Christophe Vielle
