Thanks to Madhav and Ashok! 

My own understanding was that it was "inferred meaning". 

"Context-sensitive modification/adaptation/substitution" is of course more
elegant. However, it might perhaps be an idea to add "semantic":
"context-sensitive semantic modification/adaptation/substitution". 

My question relates to a passage in the Kamasutra, where "inferred meaning"
would probably do as well, since the reader most likely would have other
things to think about than the technicalities of linguistic terminology.
