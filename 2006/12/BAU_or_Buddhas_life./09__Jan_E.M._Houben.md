Dear All,
One of the many problems of dating texts and
events in Indian cultural history concerns the
relative dates of the Brhad-Aranyaka-Upanisad and
the life of the Buddha. The 'traditional' view,
starting from estimates by Max MÃ¼ller and others,
would place the old Vedic Upanisads, including
BAU, before the Buddha. Some have argued,
however, that the BAU was composed (finalized?)
after the Buddha (and after Panini). I remember
that Johannes Bronkhorst (The two traditions of
meditation) and Richard Gombrich have written on
this (in the 80s-90s). What are the latest
contributions on this topic in which a student of
mine is interested? 
Thanks,
Jan Houben
