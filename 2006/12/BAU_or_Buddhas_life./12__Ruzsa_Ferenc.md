Dear Jan,

Bronkhorst in his forthcoming book (Greater Magadha. Studies in the Culture
of Early India. Brill, Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 2 South Asia,
19) addresses the problem in detail and suggests convincingly that many
important parts of the BU are *significantly* later than the Buddha.

Yours,
Ferenc

Subject: BAU or Buddha's life ... which came first?
