This does not refer to the text Eli is looking at/for, but the 
Sanskrit Word-Index to the Abhisamayalamkaraloka 
Prajnaparamitavyakhya [excuse abscene of diacritics] by Ryusei Keira 
and Noboru Ueda does list a number of occurences in the sutra itself, 
and many more in the cy. In the sutra they appear on pp 69, 72, 92, 
482, 841, 875 (Wogihara ed) --if it occurs other than as the first 
member of a compound, you'd have to look elsewhere though...
