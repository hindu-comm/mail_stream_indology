I have no desire to pour ghrta onto this fire, but regarding Nazism and German Indology, I believe that J.W. Hauer was involved with the ideology in the late 1930s.  Further, at this time he was closely associated with the psychologist C.G. Jung who also fell into the trap.  This is long-term memory research and not documented, but a quick google revealed the following: "To briefly summarize my judgement," wrote Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, Professor of Religion at the University of Tuebingen and member of the Secret Service of the S.S., "every undertaking and activity of anthroposophy necessarily arises out of the Anthroposophical world view. The anthroposophical world view is in the most important points directly opposed to National Socialism. Therefore, schools which are built out of the anthroposophical world view and led by anthroposophists mean danger to true German education."

My own teacher, Edgar Polome, fled Belgium one step ahead of the Wehrmacht.

I add that I am myself a Jungian psychologist and an admirer of Hauer's work on yoga.
