>I have no desire to pour ghrta onto this fire, but regarding Nazism and German 
Indology, I believe that J.W. Hauer was involved with the ideology in the late 
1930s.  Further, at this time he was closely associated with the psychologist 
C.G. Jung who also fell into the trap.  This is long-term memory research and 
not documented, but a quick google revealed the following: "To briefly 
summarize my judgement," wrote Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, Professor of Religion at 
the University of Tuebingen and member of the Secret Service of the S.S., "every 
undertaking and activity of anthroposophy necessarily arises out of the 
Anthroposophical world view. The anthroposophical world view is in the most 
important points directly opposed to National Socialism. Therefore, schools 
which are built out of the anthroposophical world view and led by 
anthroposophists mean danger to true German education."
