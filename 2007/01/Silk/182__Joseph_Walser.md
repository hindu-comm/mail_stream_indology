Even though it also deals with China, Syria and Rome, I recall that 
Xinru Liu's book, "Silk and Religion:An Exploration of Material Life and 
the Thought of People, AD 600-1200," had some interesting things to say 
about silk trade in India. In any case, she provides the "big picture" 
against which silk trade in India can be understood.
