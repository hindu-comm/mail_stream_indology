Dear All,

I write to announce a "Mahabharata Extravaganza" which is to be held on 
March 17th at SOAS in London in connection with the AHRB research project 
"Epic Constructions: Gender, Myth and Society in the Mahabharata".

Further details are available on the website:

www.soas.ac.uk/mbh

Please distribute this information to those who might be interested!

With best wishes, from Simon Brodbeck.
