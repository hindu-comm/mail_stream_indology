Kiyoshi Okano compiled a bibliography of Buddhist narrative and kavya  
literature in Sanskrit; this work is online under the URL: http:// 
homepage3.nifty.com/indology/english-index.html (compiled in 1998)
The base language is Japanese, but should be also useful for those  
who don't read Nihon-go.

Hope it helps
