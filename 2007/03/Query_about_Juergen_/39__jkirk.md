A colleague on another list has a question that I thought could get answered 
on this list:

"Can anyone direct me to a *functioning* site where I can peruse Juergen 
Aschoff's bibliography Tibet, Nepal und der Kulturraum des Himalaya?  The 
link via Ciolek's website in Australia seems no longer to be functioning."

Can anyone help with this query?

Thanks,
Joanna Kirkpatrick
