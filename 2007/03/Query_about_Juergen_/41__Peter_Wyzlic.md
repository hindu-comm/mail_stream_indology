JÃ¼rgen Aschoff is a retired professor of neurology. Parts of his  
bibliographical listings are still available at the server of his  
former working place, University of Ulm:
1. Bibliography of Tibetan medicine
http://www.uni-ulm.de/klinik/neurologie/jaschoff/tib-med/

2. German language works on Tibet and Nepal
http://www.uni-ulm.de/klinik/neurologie/jaschoff/tib-nep/

The back links do not work anymore.

Besides that, Aschoff is now an Antiquarian bookseller. Here's the  
URL: http://www.fabri-antiquariat.de/
According to the Tibet list, he still sells the printed version of  
the "Annotated Bibliography of Tibetan Medicine" published by himself.

Hope it helps
