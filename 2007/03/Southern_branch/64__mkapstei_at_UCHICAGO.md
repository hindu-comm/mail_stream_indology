A version of the story also occurs in the Taoist classic,
the Liezi, and is translated in Arthur Waley's
_Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China_.

A Tibetan Buddhist version, on which I have worked,
was an important teaching story of the Shangs-pa
bka'-brgyud tradition. They were definitely drawing
on an Indian Buddhist source, but one that
I've not yet identified.
