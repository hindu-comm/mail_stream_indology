sa.mpraapte tu kalau kaale vindhyaadrer uttare sthitaa.h

braahma.naa yaj~narahitaa jyoti.h"saastraparaa"nmukhaa.h

vindhyasya dak.si.ne bhaage yatra godaavarii nadii

tatra vedaa"s ca yaj~na"s ca bhavi.syanti kalau yuge



This verse about the southern location of the best traditions during 
the Kali yuga is cited by Altekar, History of Benares from Pre-historic 
Times to the Present Day, 1937, p.38, as being from "smritis like the 
Vyasa".  Does anyone have a more precise reference for this verse, or 
anything close to it?

Many thanks,
Dominik
