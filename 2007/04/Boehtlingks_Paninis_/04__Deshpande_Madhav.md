I want to thank Harry Spier for giving me the following details to locate the pdf file of Boehtlingk's "Paninis Grammatik":

"Paninis Grammatik" is in Google books.  Search in full text books under:
grammatik  --- in the title field
panini   -- in with the words field

Dear Indologists,

Some months ago I downloaded a pdf version of Boehtlingk's Paninis Grammatik.  But somehow my pdf file has some defect and it will not open.  Since then I have been trying to locate the online source from which I downloaded this file, but cannot locate the source.  Have tried Googlebooks, DLI, and a few other places.  Does anyone know where to locate this pdf file?  Thanks for help.
