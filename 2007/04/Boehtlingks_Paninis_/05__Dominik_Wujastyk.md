Doesn't work for me.  First, the search below just brought up lots of 
copies of Bopp.

Eventually, using "boehtlingk" inauthor, I found Panini's Grammatik, but 
the actual files it gives are Grassmann's Woerterbuch.  And it's "limited 
preview" only.

There are different licensing rules for books.google.com in the USA and 
outside, so it's not always possible to access the same titles and/or 
download possibilities when logging in from outside the USA.

Best,
Dominik

Since then I have been trying to locate the online source from which I downloaded this file, but cannot locate the source.  Have tried Googlebooks, DLI, and a few other places.  Does anyone know where to locate this pdf file?  Thanks for help.
