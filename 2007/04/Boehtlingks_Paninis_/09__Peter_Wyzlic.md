Outside the US, Google blocks access to all public domain 
titles published after 1865. From within the United 
States, it is possible to view and download books 
published before 1923. So you need an IP address in the 
USA to access these titles (compare the criticism by K. 
Graf, in
http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/1073534/)

The way to fool Google is to use a proxy server with an 
American IP address or an anonymizer. But these services 
(at least the free ones) generally do not allow 
downloading big files. Some time ago, this even worked 
from within Google by using Google's "language tools"; put 
in a link to a Google Books entry into the field 
"Translate webpage" and you have access to the otherwise 
blocked page. But nowadays it may not work properly 
anymore.

All the best
