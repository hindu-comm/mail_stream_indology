I would be grateful if someone could make the email address of Prof. Boris
A. Zakharyin (Moscow State Univ) available to me. The email I sent to
<indiaph at iaas.msu.ru> has been returned to me with the message "Mailbox
disabled for this recipient."

If Prof. Zakharyin's official postal address has changed, I would be
grateful for information in that regard too.

With thanks,

ashok aklujkar
