The following translation has just been published from Pondicherry by  
the EFEO (Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient) and the IFP (Institut  
français de Pondichéry) :

La victoire de Manasa. Traduction française du Manasavijaya, poème  
bengali de Vipradasa (XVe).
By France Bhattacharya, IFP/EFEO, 2007, xxxi, 468 p. (CI nº 105)
Language: French. 600 Rs (22 €)
By way of some surprising episodes that involve a multifarious range  
of characters, the Manasa Vijaya or Victory of Manasa (1495) portrays  
the cruel manner in which the Goddess of Serpents established a  
tradition of her worship in the world. This Bengali poem, intended  
for singing and recitation, belongs to the literary genre of the  
mangalkavya. Alongside Vedic, epic and Puranic myths, it borrows  
themes from the literature of Nath yogins, painting a large and vivid  
tableau of medieval Bengali society. This complete translation, the  
first into a European language, is accompanied by an introduction,  
notes, a bibliography and glossaries.
