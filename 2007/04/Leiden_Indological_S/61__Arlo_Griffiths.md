Dear colleagues,

With this message, I would like once again to bring to your attention  
the Indological program we will be offering in Leiden during the  
first two weeks of August, and point out that since my first  
announcement, the parallel Summer Schools in Russian, Semitic and  
Indo-European, as well as a Summer School on Language Endangerment  
and a workshop in Chinese Historical Phonology, have been finalized.  
Courses from the various Summer Schools can be combined, provided the  
daily programs do not overlap.

Please bring the following website combined to your students'  
attention: <http://www.letteren.leidenuniv.nl/summerschools/>.

Many thanks, and best greetings,
