If I may quote from the introduction to the "Sanskrit-English Glossary"
section of my _Sanskrit: an Easy Introduction to an Enchanting Language-":

When a consonant follows, vowels followed by an invariable [or genuine]
anusvara [= a nasal different from a para-savar.na or class nasal] or by a
visarga take precedence over the vowels which are not followed by either of
these 'appendage' sounds. That is, the alphabetical order for listing the
following sound sequences is as indicated by "(a)," "(b1)," "(b2)," and
"(c)":

(a) vowel followed by a vowel or by nothing [a rare situation in Skt
glossaries]

(b1) 'vowel + anusvaara' followed by a consonant,

(b2) 'vowel + visarga' followed by a consonant,

(c) vowel follwed by a consonant.



The indices prepared by Wilhelm Rau for his Vaakyapadiiya edition serve as a
good model in this respect (and so does Vishva Bandhu's
Vaidika-padaanukrama-ko;sa as far as I can recall).
