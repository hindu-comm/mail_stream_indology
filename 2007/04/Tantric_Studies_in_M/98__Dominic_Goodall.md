Hélène BRUNNER was a pioneering scholar of Śaivism whose work  
helped to forge the scholarly reputation of the French institutions  
of research in Pondicherry. This volume of essays offered in her  
memory reflects the range of her interests and offers thereby a  
picture of the state of tantric studies today. Prefaced to the volume  
is a biographical sketch of Hélène BRUNNER by her colleague and  
friend of many years, André PADOUX (directeur de recherche honoraire  
of the CNRS), as well as a complete list of her published works.
