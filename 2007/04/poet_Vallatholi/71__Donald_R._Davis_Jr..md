Vallathol Narayana Menon (1878-1958) is considered one of the three 
great early poets of modern Malayalam, along with Ulloor and Kumaran 
Asan.  He is known as the translator of RgVeda, Valmiki Ramayana, and 
several Puranas into Malayalam.  He was an ardent nationalist of the 
Gandhian stripe and instrumental in the creation of the Kerala 
Kalamandalam, a center for artistic preservation and performance near 
Thrissur.  I'm afraid I don't know any details about his visit to 
Santiniketan, but he traveled extensively.  Any book on Malayalam 
literature will contain a substantial section on Vallathol, whose work 
is truly diverse and beautiful.
