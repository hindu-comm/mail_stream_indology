Hello Ferenc,

Since it is a föiskola and not an egyetem, you might want to try something
like

Dharma Gate Buddhist Highschool or
Dharma Gate Buddhist College

You could add Budapest as well:

(The) Budapest Dharma Gate Buddhist Highschool or
(The) Budapest Dharma Gate Buddhist College

Best regards,

Lars Martin
