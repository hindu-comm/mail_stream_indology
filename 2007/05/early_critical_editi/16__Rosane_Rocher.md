Dear colleagues,

I am trying to compile a (likely very short) list of critical editions 
of Sanskrit texts prior to 1808. By "critical," I don't mean editions 
that necessarily feature a /stemma codicum/, just editions that record 
variant readings. I would be grateful for any entry you may be able to 
suggest.

Rosane Rocher
