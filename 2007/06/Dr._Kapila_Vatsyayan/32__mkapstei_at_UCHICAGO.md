I am very happy to have Dr. Vatsyayan's personal
e-mail, but as a matter of professional courtesy,
may I remind all that requests for e-mail addresses
should be answered OFF LIST, and the same for
any follow-up discussion, unless the person
concerned expressly desires his/her e-mail address
to be made public in this way.
