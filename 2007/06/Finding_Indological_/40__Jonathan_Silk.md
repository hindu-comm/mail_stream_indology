I am sure this is terribly naive of me to say this, but:

Thanks to Tim's instructions, I've wasted a bit of time looking at 
books scanned by Google. So far, everything I've looked at has some 
serious if not fatal problem--missing or illegible pages, much of the 
book simply absent (like 200 pages of the Bibliotheca Buddhica 
edition of the Zik.saasamuccaya), the title not corresponding to the 
actual scan (I was jazzed to see PW listed--except, it's not PW at 
all!--pw is there, but only partially as far as I can tell), etc.

Is this the experience of others? Have I rediscovered the wheel? Or what?
