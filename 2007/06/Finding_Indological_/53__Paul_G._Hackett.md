Dear Jonathan,

You can find Burnouf's Introduction (1876) on the Hyderabad host 
(listed as "Vol. III", i.e., Bibliotheca Orientale v. III) at:

http://dli.iiit.ac.in/cgi-bin/Browse/scripts/use_scripts/advnew/metainfo.cgi?&barcode=2020050080852

Since you already have the Google PDF of the same edition, you could 
just download only the pages that are corrupted in the Google version 
and replace them with the DLI Hyderbad images (I think you would need 
the "Full" version of Acrobat to do this, not just the reader).  FYI, 
there are 37 pages of front matter in this edition, so, for example, 
to replace p.212 of the original, you would want to download page 249 
of the Hyderabad scan.  Good hunting !  : -)
