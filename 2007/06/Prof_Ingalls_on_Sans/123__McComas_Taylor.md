Dear all,

You may be interested in this interesting video:

   http://homepage.mac.com/david.hoggan/iMovieTheater34.html

The year is 1980 at the Palo Alto Research Center.  Daniel Ingalls (a great American Sanskritist) explains the Sanskrit language, literature and writing to a crowd of computer scientists, then his son Dan Ingalls Jr. (a well‐known, then budding, computer scientist) talks about the technical side of Sanskrit/Devanāgarī character recognition.


Also, Greg Bailey was just on the ABC The Book Show talking about Sanskrit: http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bookshow/default.htm

Mark
