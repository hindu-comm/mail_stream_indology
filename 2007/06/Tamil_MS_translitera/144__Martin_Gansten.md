With apologies for cross-posting: I have uploaded images of a Tamil
palm-leaf MS to
http://www.martingansten.se/Nadi/
The MS itself is not very old, but a few Tamil scholars have still had some
trouble deciphering it. I would be grateful for any help in transliterating
the text, particularly the areas near the four purple underlinings, which
are supposed to contain proper nouns.

Thanks in advance,
