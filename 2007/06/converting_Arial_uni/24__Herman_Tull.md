I wonder if anyone can provide expertise on the following: I've written a 
fairly large document (2645 kb) in roman and devanagari in Word 2003 (on a 
PC), using Baraha software and Arial unicode MS throughout.  When I convert 
to .pdf the resulting document retains the devanagari and the roman, but 
does not space the devanagari letters properly.  Not all the letters are 
off, but a significant fraction appear with the odd spacing (runover 
letters, odd blank spaces, off margins).  I am using pdf 995 "printer" 
software to carry out the conversion.

Any suggestions on how to improve the .pdf output would be greatly 
appreciated.
