Dear Colleagues,

I am in Delhi for the moment, and planning to visit Kerala in order to collect copies of mathematical manuscripts, I am looking for ancient, out of print, editions of mathematical and astronomical sanskrit treatises.
Could anyone tell me precisely where I could find such books or second hand books shops, in Delhi or in Kerala ?

Many thanks,

Dr J.M.Delire,
Secretary of the Center for History of Science,
