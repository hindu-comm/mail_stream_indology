I have recently downloaded an Indic Unicode font called Times_IndUni, so 
that I can transliterate Sanskrit terms using the correct diacriticals. 
Unfortunately, I am having trouble figuring out the key-strokes for 
everything I need and wondered if anyone had, by chance, compiled a list of 
key-strokes for entering diacriticals (macrons, etc.) for said font.
