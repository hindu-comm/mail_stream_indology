Chris,
Have you looked at the following books?

*Asoka,*

Devadatta Ramakrishna *Bhandarkar*

1969 *4th ed.*
*English* Book Book xxx, 366 p. 23 cm.
[Calcutta] University of Calcutta, 

and

*The inscriptions of Asoka,*

*Asoka*, King of Magadha;  Devadatta Ramakrishna *Bhandarkar*;  
Surendranath *Majumdar*

1920
*English* Book Book 3 p. l., 103 p. 25 x 19 cm.
[Calcutta] University of Calcutta,

The last chapter of the ist books talks about the Asokan inscriptions 
and the sixth chapter also talks about Social and religious life from 
Asokan monuments.

I think you may find what you are looking for in either of these books.
Hope this helps.

Bindu
