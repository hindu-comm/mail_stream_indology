Dear friends,

In something now in the press, I have a passage in which the term 
viralikaa occurs, a sort of colorful fabric. BR explains it as a sort 
of porous fabric. Does anyone have a more specific suggestion as to 
its identity? (The editor queried my translation as chiffon, which I 
confess was a much a place filler as anything else...)
