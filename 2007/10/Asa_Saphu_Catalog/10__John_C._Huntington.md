Dear Indology members

My colleague Dina Bangdel has identified (and converted to a useful  
file) the Asa Saphu catalogue of the Nagoya Buddhist Library DVD  
collection of Sanskrit manuscripts,  which apparently comes without  
an index(?!?). If any one would like a copy of this important  
material please e-mail me of list. <huntington.1 at osu.edu>

Cheers

John
