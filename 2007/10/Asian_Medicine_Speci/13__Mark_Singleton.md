Dear All,

I would like to draw your attention to the new special yoga issue of _Asian 
Medicine, Tradition and Modernity_, guest-edited by myself.

_Asian Medicine_ is a multidisciplinary journal aimed at researchers and 
practitioners of Asian medicine in Asia as well as western countries. This 
new issue examines yoga's changing status with regard to medicine, health 
and healing, offering a range of insights into their interaction and mutual 
appropriation in modern and pre-modern times. As such it provides a timely 
opportunity for critical reflection on yoga's function and status, both 
with regard to Indian systems of medicine, and more generally.

Copies can be ordered through IASTAM 
(http://www.iastam.org/collateral/Flyer02B.pdf) or Brill 
(http://www.brill.nl/asme). See below for a list of contents.

Best wishes,
Mark Singleton
