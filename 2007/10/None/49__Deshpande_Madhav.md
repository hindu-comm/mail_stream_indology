There is a famous Nrsimha temple in Maharashtra in a town called Nira - Narsingapur.  I don't have a map in front of me, but this town is probably on the bank of the river Neeraa/Niraa (?).  There is indeed a river in the region by that name.  This town is close to my family's original home town, Tembhurni, near Solapur, and Nrsimha has been the family deity of the Deshpande family.
