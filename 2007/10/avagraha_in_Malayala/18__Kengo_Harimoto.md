Thanks for bringing back the topic.  I have finally located the sign  
best interpreted as avagraha in the manuscript(s) I used.  I think I  
can finally fulfill my promise...

Scans are available at:

"pañcaparvvaṇo 'vidyādīn kleśān"

"tuśabdo 'vadh" (this is the end of the line, and continues  
"āraṇārthaḥ".)

"yogagrahṇe 'sati"

The second one is small and ambiguous, but the other two share a  
distinctive shape; the shape described by Asko Parpola in the post on  
September 2, 2007.

As I mentioned in an earlier post, these are anomalies.  It turns out  
that these fragments all come from a single folio (folio 4 of the  
manuscript of the Pātañjalayogaśāstravivaraṇa, perserved in the  
Oriental Manuscript Library, Trivandrum, L. 662).  I could not find  
any more (although I cannot claim that I have been thorough).

Now that I have scans of the Malayalam manuscripts I have used, I  
will try to submit them to Indoskript.
