Beside the history of Grantha-Malayalam script of the last centuries, 
still to be written (for palaeographical use), it could be noted that 
there exists in the modern typography of Malayaa.lam language a very 
rare sign used for the apostrophe or elision, similar to (and 
obviously borrowed from) the latin one, and that grammars call 
vi/s.lee.sa.m :
ex. paa.tattuu'nnu ("from the field'") written for paa.tattuninnu

With best wishes,
Chrsitophe Vielle
