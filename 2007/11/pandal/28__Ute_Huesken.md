Dear list members,

I need some help with the etymology and usage of the term pandal (or
pantal, in Tamil).

pandal is usually rendered as a temporary roof, a shed, booth, shelter,
or triumphal arch, esp. for temporary use (at a festival, etc.); a marquee;
a tent or booth for a marriage.

The Madras Tamil Dictionary says:
pantalpirittal the ceremony of removing the pandal erected for marriage, etc. 
pantalvaricai money presented to the bride and bridegroom at the marriage pandal

>From Northern Tamil Nadu I am familiar with the ritual pantalkal, the
worship of the first pole of a pandal at an auspicious moment, before the
pandal is erected. Moreover, here the term pandal seems not to be restricted
to marriage tents or -marquees, but to all temporary roofs erected at any
auspicious occasion; not only for domestic rituals, but also for temple
festivals.

Regards,
Ute Huesken
