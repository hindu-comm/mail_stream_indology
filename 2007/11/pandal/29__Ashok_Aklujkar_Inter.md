Pl check Hobson-Jobson and similar resources for Indian or British-Indian
English (the spelling may occasionally be with an "e" in the first
syllable). 

My recollection is that I read somewhere that pandal/pantal and Skt
ma.n.dapa are related. But then I also recall reading an article in which
ma.n.dapa was said to come from Tamil/Dravidian.
