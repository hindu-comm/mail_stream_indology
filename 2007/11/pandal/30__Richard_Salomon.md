If my memory is correct, this term is also used in Bengal in reference to 
the elaborate displays which are erected each year for Durga-puja. So 
perhaps not Dravidian, or at least not exclusively so.

Subject: pandal


Dear list members,

I need some help with the etymology and usage of the term "pandal" (or
pantal, in Tamil).

"pandal" is usually rendered as "a temporary roof, a shed, booth, shelter,
or triumphal arch, esp. for temporary use (at a festival, etc.); a marquee;
a tent or booth for a marriage."

The Madras Tamil Dictionary says:
pantalpirittal the ceremony of removing the pandal erected for marriage, 
etc.
pantalvaricai money presented to the bride and bridegroom at the marriage 
pandal

>âFrom Northern Tamil Nadu I am familiar with the ritual "pantalkal", the
worship of the first pole of a pandal at an auspicious moment, before the
pandal is erected. Moreover, here the term pandal seems not to be restricted
to marriage tents or -marquees, but to all temporary roofs erected at any
auspicious occasion; not only for domestic rituals, but also for temple
festivals.

Regards,
Ute Huesken
