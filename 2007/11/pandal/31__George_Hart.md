The word pantal (or pantar) -- the t is voiced -- occurs many times in  
Sangam literature, 1-3rd CE.  It is definitely a Dravidian word.  DED  
3299 lists cognates, with almost the same meaning, in almost every  
central and southern Dravidian language.  That means it probably goes  
back 3000 or more years, to before these languages separated --  
especially as the cognates do not seem to be borrowings.  Emeneau once  
told me that of all the Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali and its close  
relatives seem most affected by a Dravidian substratum, so it's  
scarcely surprising that a Dravidian word crops up in Bengali.  George
