The main site was live as recently as this past Spring, but both that 
site <http://www.rism.cn> and its linked site ('Paleography') 
<http://sfl.pku.edu.cn/sanskrit/pale.htm> now appear to be dead.  You 
can however, access some of the main pages of RISM via the Internet 
Archive's "WaybackMachine" at:

http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.rism.cn

and in particular:

http://web.archive.org/web/20070109164314/http://www.rism.cn/
http://web.archive.org/web/20070115164252/http://www.rism.cn/

The <http://sfl.pku.edu.cn/sanskrit/pale.htm> page does *not* appear 
to have been archived, however.
