Si.mharaaja's Praak.rtaruupaavataara is a Prakrit grammar which  
comments on the same suutras as were commented by Trivikrama. It has  
been excellently edited by Eugen Hultzsch:

Prakritararupavatara. A Prakrit Grammar based on the Valmikisutra. By  
Simhararaja Son of Samudrabandhayajvan. Ed. by E. Hultzsch. [London:]  
1909. (Prize Publication Fund. I.)

According to Luigia Nitti-Dolci (Les grammairiens Prakrits, Paris  
1938, p. 185),
Si.mharaaja's commentary is very poor ("très pauvre"), since it does  
not give examples taken from literary texts ("ne donne pas d'exemples  
tirés de textes littéraires"), but is a meagre catalogue of forms ("un  
aride catalogue de formes").  S.'s commentary is entirely independent  
of Trivikrama's commentary ("son commentaire est absolument  
indépendant de celui de T.")

Best wishes,
Roland Steiner
