Dear Friends,

 It is my pleasure to announce that thanks to the kindness of Dr Ole Holten
Pind, the CPD is back online.
The link is http://pali.hum.ku.dk/cpd

Everyone working in Indian and Buddhist Studies will appreciate the
generosity of this effort!

With apologies for cross-posting to H-Buddhism and Indology, J SIlk
