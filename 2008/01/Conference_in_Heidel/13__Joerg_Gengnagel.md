Dear colleagues,

as a member of the organizing committee in Heidelberg I would like to 
inform you about the above mentioned international conference on "Ritual 
Dynamics and the Science of Ritual" which will be held from 29 September 
to 2 October 2008 in Heidelberg. So far Jan Heesterman, James Laidlaw, 
Alexis Sanderson, Frederick M. Smith and Frits Staal are among the 
participating South Asianists. Please see www.rituals-2008.com for more 
information. A tentative programme will be online by next week.

Best wishes

Jörg Gengnagel
