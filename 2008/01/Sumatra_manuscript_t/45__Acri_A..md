Dear Daniel Stender,

it must be a Batak ms. - cf. these samples:

I would suggest to contact dr. Uli Kozok (kozok at hawaii.edu), one of the best experts in Sumatran mss.

Regards,

Andrea Acri

Subject: Sumatra manuscript text identification

Michael Herkenhoff from the Manuscript Department of the University
Library in Bonn asked me for help finding someone who can give information
about a recently obtained manuscript from Indonesia. Maybe there
is a scholar on the list who can identify script, language, text etc., or
knows somebody who does.

Here are pictures of the first and the last two pages:
