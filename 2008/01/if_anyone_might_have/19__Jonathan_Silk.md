Some years ago Cambridge University published (through UMI/ProQuest) a
microfilm edition of their collection of Skt MSS. Unfortunately, as far as I
can tell there is no access to it here in Leiden. I wonder if some member of
this list might have access to these films (or to the originals !), and be
able to check a reading for me. If so, please email me!

thank you so much, jonathan
