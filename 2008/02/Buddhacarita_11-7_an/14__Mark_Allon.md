Thanks for the link to this useful resource. Unless I missed them, a quick search showed that several Japanese Buddhist Studies/Indology journals were not listed:

Buddhist Studies (Bukkyō Kenkyū)
Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies
Nagoya Studies in Indian Culture and Buddhism

Is there a site that lists all Japanese Buddhist Studies/Indology journals and their access status?

Regards
Mark
