There is a Russian ebook search engine called EBDB. The English  
language interface is available under
URL: <http://www.ebdb.net/>
The Russian interface:
URL: <http://www.eBdb.ru/>

Besides some general sites (like archive.org in the US or Project  
Gutenberg) EBDB also lists some  that require a user/password  
verification.  An unspecified search for "sanskrit" gives 79 results  
(looking for Sanskrit in Cyrillic characters "санскрит" I get  
44 hits). When I look more specifically for "Minaev" (in Cyrillic:  
минаев) EBDB lists many unrelated names and publications but  
also two hits of one book of the Russian Indologist Ivan P. Minaev  
(the edition of the Patimokkha published in 1869). One hit requires  
registration, the other one uses a bit too complicated download  
procedure. (Minaev died in 1890 and all of his works are now free of  
copyright in most countries.)

You find some lists of digitized indologica from time to time in this  
Google forum:
"Общество ревнителей санскрита (Sanscrit)"

Hope it helps
