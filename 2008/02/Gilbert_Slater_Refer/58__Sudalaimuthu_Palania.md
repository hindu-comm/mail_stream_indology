Dear Scholars,

I am looking for a reference in the following book

"The Dravidian element in Indian culture" by Gilbert Slater originally  
published in 1924 and reprinted in 1976 and 1982. 

I would appreciate if anyone with access to the book could contact me  
off-list.

Sorry for cross-posting.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
S. Palaniappan
