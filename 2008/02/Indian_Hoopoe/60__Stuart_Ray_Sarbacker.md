Greetings--

Apologies for cross-posting.

Can anyone clarify for me whether there are Sanskrit and Pali terms  
that are unique to the Indian Hoopoe (bird)?

I have come across a (Jataka) translation that provides Hoopoe for  
the Pali singila (Skt. zRGgin), and I'm wondering if that is accurate/ 
specific to the Hoopoe.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Stuart
