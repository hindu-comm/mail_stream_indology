Dear Colleagues,

The Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of Hamburg would like to 
bring the following event to your attention, which may be of interest to some 
of your students and students of your university in general. 

The International Summer School 2008: Buddhism into the 21st Century (28.07.-
01.08.2008) is a one-week course explicitly designed for students from all 
areas of study without any prior expertise in Buddhist Studies. Apart from 
introducing approaches to the study of Buddhism, it offers topics from 
religion and politics in Tibet, Buddhist art, neuropsychological perspectives 
and creativity. 

You are most welcome to spread this announcement to your department, other 
departments of your university or to those who are interested in international 
exchange.  

At our website www.summerschool-buddhism.de you will find further information 
concerning the program, lecturers, and registration. Feel free to contact us 
anytime, should you have further questions or inquiries. Please send a note if 
you would like to receive our flyer and poster in print. 

Sincerely,

Michael Zimmermann
(Professor for Indian Buddhism,
 Director of the Center for Buddhist Studies)
