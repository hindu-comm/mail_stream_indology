Shyam,

A philosophically astute study that concentrates on Abhinavagupta (his
theory of drama, aesthetics, etc.) which also deals with rasa theory is J.
Moussaieff Masson's _Santarasa and Abhinavagupta's Philosophy of Aesthetics_
Bhandarkar Research Institute, 1969. It's out of print, but should be
available at a good university library or by interlibrary loan.
