Dear Shyam,

There are a number of useful treatments of rasa in The Dhvanyaloka of
Anandavardhana with the Locana of Abhinavagupta, fully translated by Daniel
Ingalls et.al. in 1990 (Harvard University Press). There is an extensive
index heading under rasa (pp. 814-816).

Best Wishes,

Benjamin Fleming
