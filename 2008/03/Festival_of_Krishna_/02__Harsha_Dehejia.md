But Krishna is not only for the royalty and nobility, he belongs to the people, the potter and the puppeteer, the bride and the mother, for he is celebrated at every village fair and town. Equally the modern artist does not remain untouched by the magic of Krishna and depecits him on his palette. And as the journey ends we are privy to some of the most glorious moments of five magnificient centuries of Krishna paintings.> >> >> >> >> >> > More to Explore> >> > See more in Arts & Photography > Religious> > More New Releases> > Top Sellers> > Recommended for You> > Sincerely,> > Amazon.comhttp://amazon.com> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> >> > We hope you found this message to be useful.
