***MA studentships in the History of Medicine***

Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL


The Centre is the world's largest research institute devoted to the study 
of the History of Medicine. It invites applications from prospective MA 
students with a good honours degree for one year commencing September 
2008. The Centre anticipates being able to offer three studentships at 
approximately Â£19,500 plus the payment of home fees. Applications to study 
full or part time without a scholarship are also welcome. The deadline for 
the application is 15 May 2008. Interviews will be held in June. For 
further details, see http://www.ucl.ac.uk/histmed/teaching/MA/index.html 
For information and application forms, contact Adam Wilkinson: 
ucgaawi at ucl.ac.uk

-----------------

This may not seem particularly indological, but the course offers 
possibilities for the serious study of ayurveda, including doing an MA 
thesis that could make use of original sources in the Asian languages 
supported by scholars at the Centre, that include Sanskrit, Arabic, Urdu, 
Chinese, and Tamil.
