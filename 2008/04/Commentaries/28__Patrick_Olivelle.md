Dear Friends;

I wonder whether you can resolve a question regarding the Sanskrit 
commentarial tradition. We have early examples in the grammatical 
tradition of Katyayana and Patanjali. But then I see a hiatus until 
about the fifth century, with Sabara; then we get a continuous series 
of commentaries in the philosophical traditions, Mimamsa, and from 
about the 8th century in Dharmasastra. Besides perhaps the Buddhist 
authors, do we have examples of commentaries after Patanjali and 
before Sabara?

Thanks.

Patrick Olivelle
