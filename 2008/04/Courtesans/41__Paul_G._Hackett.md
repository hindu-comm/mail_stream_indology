The full citation is:

H.L. Hariyappa, and Madhukar Mangesh Patkar 
(eds.), _Professor P.K. Gode commemoration 
volume_  Poona: Oriental Book Agency (1960), pp. 
347-349.

but see also the review by Sternbach:

"Professor P.K. Gode commemoration volume 
[Review]," JAOS 81(2) [1961]: 154-158, p.158.

Also, there is a wealth of primary sources cited in:

Sukumari Bhattacharji, "Prostitution in Ancient 
India," Social Scientist, 15(2) [Feb. 1987]: 
32-61.

Although not mentioned in that article, I have 
seen references in Tibetan literature to 
prostitutes belonging to tantric communities in 
India (ca. 8th-9th century), and I would be 
interested in hearing about any references 
*specifically* discussing the role of 
prostitutes/courtesans in Indian tantric circles 
should you come across them.
