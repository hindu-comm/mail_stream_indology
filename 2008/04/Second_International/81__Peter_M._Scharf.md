Dear Colleagues,
	I would like to invite you to attend the Second International  
Sanskrit Computational Linguistics Symposium and Sanskrit Library  
Workshop to be held at Brown University 15-17 May 2008.  The  
symposium opens with a keynote address by George Cardona entitled,  
"On the structure of Pāṇini’s system" and includes sessions on  
Modeling Pāṇinian Grammar, Computational linguistic analysis,  
Semantics and Lexicography, and Automated manuscript collation and  
text-image alignment. The latter session includes presentations by  
leading researchers in Devanagari OCR technology (Thomas Breuel and  
Venugopal Govindaraju) and by Peter Robinson, designer of Collate and  
Edition critical edition software.  Please have a look at the program  
and other details at the Symposium website at the following address  
and bring it to the attention of interested scholars and students.

	Sincerely,
