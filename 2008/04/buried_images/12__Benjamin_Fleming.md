Dear Fred Smith,

There is a description of the burial of the Jagannaatha images in Orissa by
G.C. Tripathi in his article, "Navakalevara", in The Cult of Jagannath and
the Regional Tradition of Orissa, ed. by A. Eschmann, H. Kulke, and G.C.
Tripathi (Manohar, 2005 [reprint of 1978]), pp 225-264, esp. 261.

Although, perhaps not for "prophylactic" purposes, "apotropaic" is something
of a broad category and you might find this relevant.


Regards,

Benjamin Fleming
