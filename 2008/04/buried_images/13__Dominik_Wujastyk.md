When travelling in Kathiawar in the early 90s with Peter Schreiner, we 
encountered local living traditions in the Dhank/Junagadh region of 
underground murtis.  These were thought to be relics from an earlier 
and better time, before a sage cursed the former town to sink underground. 
The villagers routinely discovered murtis when building the foundations of 
new houses, and this was their explanation.

I would expect Tod to have records of this in his Travels in Western 
India.  I've found several of the legends he collected are still 
current in village communities today.

Best,
Dominik
