Dear colleagues,

Dear colleagues,

Any of you who use my utility ur2ud, which converts from Unicode Roman
to Unicode Devanagari, will wish to know that I have just released a
new version. This is entirely a bugfix release -- there are no changes
in fuctionality.

C source and a Win32 executable are both included in the file
cconv.zip, which can be downloaded by following the "programs" link
from my web page (bombay.indology.info) and then the link to "A second
set of conversion programs...".

Best wishes,
John Smith
