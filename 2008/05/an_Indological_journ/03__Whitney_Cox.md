Dear members of the list,

In A.V. Naik's Inscriptions of the Deccan: An Epigraphical
Survey (Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute vol.
9, 1947-48), I've come across repeated references to a
publication that he abbreviated as QBISM, without seemingly
glossing it in his notes or bibliography.  He also does this
for other, familiar publications (JBBRAS, IA, EI, etc), but I
can't figure out what QBISM might stand for.  Could anyone
decode this for me?

Thanks,

Whitney
