Join the queue!  This is one of those famous libraries that has treasures, 
but that nobody can get into (+ Woolner collection, Anup collection). 
Apparently there are five trustees, elders of the Jain community, who each 
hold a key to a separate padlock on the library.  So you have to get all 
five men together in Jaisalmere, all willing to open up.  So it never 
happens.

One of the few people who has worked on MSS from the 
Jaisalmere Jnanabhandar was Esther Solomon, who edited three early Samkhya 
commentaries from amazingly early and important Jain MSS from the 
collection (Matharavritti etc., I think).

About 10 years back, I heard rumours that someone had got into 
the Jnanabhandar with a photocopy machine and that copies were 
circulating.  But I never had concrete information from this.  Perhaps 
someone else knows more?

Best,
Dominik
