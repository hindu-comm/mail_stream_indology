VISUALISING THE RAMAYANA: A STUDY DAY 



Tuesday 8 July 2008 



10.00 - 16.30 

The Conference Centre, British Library, 96 Euston Road, London, NW1 2DB 

Price: £25 (concessions £15) 

Tickets may be booked online at http://boxoffice.bl.uk, by phone on +44 (0)1937 546546 

or in person at the British Library Information Desk. 

Perhaps more than any other story in world literature, the Ramayana has been imaginatively represented in 

a vast variety of different forms. From ancient painting and sculpture, via shadow puppetry, dances, vast 

community plays and mask drama, to contemporary shrines, calendars and diwali effigies. To these one could 

add an ever growing catalogue of TV series, films and cartoons. 



Visualising The Ramayana is a day of presentations and discussions exploring some of this remarkable richness 

that flourishes across Asia to this day. 



This event is a part of the programme accompanying The Ramayana - Love and Valour in India's Great Epic, 

a major free exhibition at the British Library, until 14 September 2008. For more information please visit

ADDITIONAL EVENING EVENT 





18.30 

Screening of 'Sita Sings the Blues' 

(Nina Paley, USA, 2008, 82 mins) 



Sita is a goddess separated from her beloved Lord and husband Rama. Nina is an animator 

whose husband moves to India, then dumps her by email. Three hilarious shadow puppets narrate 

both ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this dazzlingly animated new interpretation of the 

Ramayana. Set to the 1920's jazz vocals of Annette Hanshaw, Sita Sings the Blues earns its tagline 

as 'the greatest break-up story ever told'. www.sitasingstheblues.com 



Directed, written, produced, designed and animated by Nina Paley, who will introduce 

the screening. 



Nina Paley is a longtime veteran of syndicated comic strips in the US, creating Fluff, The Hots and 

Nina's Adventures. In 1998 she began making independent animated festival films, including the 

controversial yet popular environmental short, The Stork. In 2002 Nina followed her then-husband 

to Trivandrum, India, where she read her first Ramayana. This inspired her first feature, Sita Sings 

the Blues, which she animated and produced single-handedly over five years. Nina teaches at 

Parsons School of Design in Manhattan and is a 2006 Guggenheim Fellow
