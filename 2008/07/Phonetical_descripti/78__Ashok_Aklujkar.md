Skt (/Austro-Asiatic? Mayrhofer KEWA p. 270) ko.ti may be  semantically
parallel. Note the meanings 'the curved end of a bow,' 'the edge or point of
a weapon,' 'the highest point, excess, peak' 'the complement of an arch to
90 degrees,' 'the perpendicular side of a right-angled triangle' in enlarged
Apte p. 697.
