Friends:

I am working on arches in Indian designs and forms.

Very often Indian artists and artisans create arches even in a two dimensional design to enclose the main form. 

Are these arches a variation of toranas or festoons or gateways?

I would love hearing from scholars who have thought about this.

Regards.
