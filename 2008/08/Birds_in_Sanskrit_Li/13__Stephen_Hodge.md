The information provided tends to confirm my suspicions: the text I am 
studying has multiple authorship, with one person treating kaara.n.dava as a 
distinct bird, and another person who definiteley identifies kaara.n.dava 
with cakravaaka, going so far as to refer to "sa.mvaasa-kaara.n.da" after 
the well-known myth about cakravaalas.

Many thanks,
