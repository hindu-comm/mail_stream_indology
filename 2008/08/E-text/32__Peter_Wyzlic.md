Concerning: http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/

You may go to the font troubleshooting page that should be readable for
all browsers: http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/ifont.htm
There is no hint how to deal with Safari in Mac OS. One solution might
be you download the Devanagari Truetype font (go to "download fonts" and
"Linux users") and try to install. The download link is:
http://www.sankara.iitk.ac.in/ttf/DVYG0ntt.ttf

This website uses so called "dynamic fonts", this is a technology that
came up in the nineties and worked with some versions of some web
browsers but not in others. In my opinion, it becomes more and more
obsolete. They should switch to Unicode encoding which is more
state-of-the-art.

Hope it helps
