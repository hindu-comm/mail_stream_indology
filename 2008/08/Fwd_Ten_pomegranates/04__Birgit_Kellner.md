As it luckily happens to lie on my desk - Vincent Eltschinger's "Penser 
l'autorité des Écritures. La Polémique de Dharmakīrti contre la notion 
brahmanique orthodoxe d'un Veda sans auteur. Autour de Pramāṇavārttika 
I.213-268 et Svavṛtti" (Vienna 2007: Österreichische Akademie der 
Wissenschaften) contains a footnote on the passage in question with 
further references: p. 102, n. 106. According to Eltschinger, the 
example is widespread and can also be found at Śabarabhāṣya on 
Mīmaṃsasūtra 1.1.5, Nyāyabhāṣya on Nyāyasūtra 5.2.10, Dharmakīrti's own 
Vādanyāya (ed. Much, p. 43, l.14), and further in Jaina commentaries on 
the Avaśyakaniryukti, see Nalini Balbir, "The Perfect Sūtra as Defined 
by the Jainas", Berliner Indologische Studien 3 (1987), 3-21.

Hope this helps,

Birgit Kellner
