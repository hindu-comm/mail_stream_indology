Dear Anna,

   Nice to hear from you, even in connection with this
less-than-happy news.  I'm back in New Orleans now, getting
ready to slog through another semester of "World Religions".
 Finished up in Pondicherry in early June --far too hot to
be working there, but that's the way it worked out.

   Hope you're work goes well, and good luck with the fight
for open stacks and greater accessibilty!

best,
Tim
