There's another dialect (or rather: sub-dialect) of V encoding in  
existence: it's the Aklujkar-Tubb (or Tubb-Aklujkar?) scheme with  
extensions for writing the literary Dravidian languages: ee, oo, _l, _n  
and _r. I suppose it ought to be called TAZ ;-) -- Tubb is monosyllabic,  
and Aklujkar and Zydenbos look prosodically  identical, but the Z is  
historically clearly the latest, represents a junior, and looks best at  
the end of the abbreviation.

Why does this exist? TAZ is used for writing a flat ASCII text which can  
be converted to a number of other codings (CSX+, Unicode, TeX [codes that  
look like \={a}, etc.], and Baraha for Kannada) using filters which I've  
written. (Anybody interested? Contact me off-list. You need a Python  
interpreter on your computer. This is standard on Mac and Linux systems,  
and is available free of cost for Windows.)
