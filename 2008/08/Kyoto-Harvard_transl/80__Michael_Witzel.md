Sanjay (below) seems to refer to the frequent Vedic compound  
zUdrArya- (Unicode: śūdrārya-), where to many people's surprise,  
the grammarians mentioned below included, the Shudras come first.

Well, for a good  reason  -- again that of prosody or syllable count.

The Rgveda mostly has the clear, metrically indicated, trisyllabic  
reading  [aariya]  (āriya) for (KH) Arya (aarya, ārya-), as noted  
already by Grassmann 1873, RV Dictionary column 185-6.

In short, Panini-Behaghel's  (2+1+1, 2+2+2) rule is strictly  
followed, against all contemporary social sensitivities:

zUdra+Ariya (śūdra+āriya):  2 syll + 3 syllables, or :  2+1, 2+1+1  
morae.

In fact, this has been noted and explained long ago by Hans Oertel :  
"zUdrArya", I think in ZDMG 1936;  see now H.Oertel, Kleine  
Schriften. Heinrich Hettrich,  Thomas Oberlies (eds.). Stuttgart :  
Franz Steiner Verlag, 1994.


A nice weekend!
