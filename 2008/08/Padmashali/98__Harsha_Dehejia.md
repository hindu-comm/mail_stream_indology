Friends:

Can anyone help me with the story of Padmashali, the first weavers, who draw a fibre from the lotus that arises from the navel of Vishnu, and then weave fabrics for the gods?

I remember seeing an Andhra scroll may years ago. Are there any images in museums of this episode?

Thank you.

Harsha.
