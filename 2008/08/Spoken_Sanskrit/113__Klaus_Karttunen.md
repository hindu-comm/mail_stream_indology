Dear colleagues,
H. H. Hock studied spoken Sanskrit in the 1980s in U.P., in Lucknow  
and Varanasi, if I remember right. See his article  “Spoken Sanskrit  
in Uttar Pradesh — a sociolinguistic profile”, Journal of  
Orientology. Lokaprajñā vol. 2. Prof. N. S. Rāmānuja Tātācārya  
Felicitation Volume. Puri 1988, 1–24. There has been a small  
percentage of people giving Sanskrit as their language in every  
census, but often it seems to be "father tongue" rather than "mother  
tongue".
Regards,
Klaus
