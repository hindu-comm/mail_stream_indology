Thank you very much to Dipak Bhattacharya and Matthew Kapstein for their replies to my continued inquiry. I believe that Professor Kapstein's suggestion "tatsama" works well in the passage, provided of course that it can be understood in a more literal meaning that is different from its later technical use of denoting Sanskrit loanwords in New Indo-Aryan languages, as also noted by Kapstein. I think that would be an acceptable supposition for its occurrence in two 6th-7th century texts. Thank you very much for the kind help.

Sincerely, 
Tim
