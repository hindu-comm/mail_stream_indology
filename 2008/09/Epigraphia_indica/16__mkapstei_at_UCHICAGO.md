I am very grateful to Anna Slaczka in Leiden
and Burhkard Quessel in London for having
so quickly responded with the required pages
scanned. Others have kindly written to me
as well. Now that I have the pages though, please
do not go to any further trouble! I thank
all who responded, or were thinking to respond soon.
