I found on Jan Houben's web site a nice video of boys reciting RV 1.1.1. I
am wondering if anyone knows of a nice short audio or video clip of anyone
reciting a verse (ideally this one, but I'm not picky) in paa.tha style,
again ideally, ghana-paa.tha. I'd just like to illustrate to students how it
is done, and I won't use the clip commercially, or for anything other than
classroom presentation.

many thanks!  jonathan
