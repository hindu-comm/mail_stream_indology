Dear colleague,

An ointment on drums (dundubhilepa) with wonderful results when these drums 
are sounded is described in the Su'srutasa.mhitaa, Kalpasthaana six 
(dundubhisvaniiya).
The A.s.taangasa.mgraha (Suutrasthaana 8.5)  prescribes the sounding of 
dundubhis during the meal of a king.
Magical practices with a dundubhi are already known in the Atharvaveda 
(5.31.7).
Hoping this is of some interest to you,
with best wishes,

Jan Meulenbeld
