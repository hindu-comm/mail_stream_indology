Accidental private messages are relatively rare.  Mostly they don't seem 
to cause any problem.  On one or two occasions in the last two or three 
years it seemed proper (with consultation) to erase the message from the 
public archive.

The overhead of list moderation is VERY severe, and I am certain that none 
of the committee members would be willing or able to take on the burden of 
vetting every message.

For the forseeable future, this will remain an unmoderated forum. The only 
real alternative is to close the list down (as happened once before). 
But I don't think we're remotely near that necessity at the moment.

I hope we can agree that with a bit of good will, we can just continue to 
politely ignore accidental private messages.

Could everyone be extra careful with the "send" button, and have a quick 
glance at the "to:" field before sending?

Best wishes,

Dominik
