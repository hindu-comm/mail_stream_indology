Dear colleagues,

I've just discovered that Pan Nalin's film "Ayurveda: The Art of Being" is 
freely downloadable from the Internet Archive.  Here's the link:

   http://www.archive.org/details/Ayurveda__art_of_being

The film is made to a high technical standard, and is quite a good
documentary.  It isn't a scholarly piece, however, and from a historians
point of view there are regrettable lapses here and there.  However, the
photography is good, the content interesting, and it makes a very good
teaching aid if you are trying to capture the interest of students, or
provide material on which to base a class discussion.

Best,
Dominik
