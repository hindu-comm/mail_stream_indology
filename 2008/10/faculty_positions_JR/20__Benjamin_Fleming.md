Well it may be that Canadian job notices "specify" that Canadians will have
priority; this is because they are required by law. In practice, however,
Canadian university, at least the larger ones, tend to vie for foreign
candidates. At least this has been my observation. I would be interested, in
the Indian example, to know how the hiring works in practice as opposed to
what the law specifies. I do know foreigners who have held positions at
Indian Universities.

Best,

BF
