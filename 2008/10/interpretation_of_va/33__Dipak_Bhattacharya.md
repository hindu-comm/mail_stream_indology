yamaapatti occurs in Rkpraati;saakhya 6.9 in the sense of 'becoming yama'. The previous verse mentions anunaasikas becoming 'own' (svaan; antaratama of Paa.nini) yamas ('changed to a twin' M.D.Shastri). The meaning of aapatti with ;Saunaka should be clear though it may mean 'occurrence' in a different context. 

Metamorphosis of linguistic elements, the evolutionary point of view in general, is something not to be found in Paa;nini but is common with Yaaska and ;Saunaka. Deshpande, true to his school as a Paa;ninian, has not gone beyond replacement that is the thing Paa.nini sees in a phonemic change. The difference between the Paa;ninians and Vai;se.sikas(alsoNaiyaayikas, obviously for linguistic change only) on one hand and Yaaska, the Saankhyas, ;Saunaka etc on the other on the concept of change is very strong (see D.Bhattacharya Indian Etymologists etc.RBU Kolkata 2002,pp.25-29).
