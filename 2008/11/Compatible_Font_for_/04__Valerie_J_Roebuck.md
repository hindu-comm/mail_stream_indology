Are you sure? I tried Gandhari Unicode when trying to process some 
documents on my husband's Mac with OS X , and I couldn't even get it 
to produce a lower case anusvAra M. (When I used the thing that's 
supposed to let you find non-standard characters, it put in a rather 
messy upper case one instead). I would like to know this, because I 
have been happily using the Norman fonts on my ancient Mac Classic 
for many years, with Pop Char for when I need to find a particularly 
obscure character, and am dreading the day (surely not far off) when 
I have to get a modern Mac with OS X.
