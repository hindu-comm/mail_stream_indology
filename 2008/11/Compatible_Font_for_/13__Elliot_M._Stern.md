I've been using Times_Ind_Uni-Roman for some time on my MacBook Pro.  
It works well, if you select the Inuktitut - Nunavut keyboard. The  
font was available from John D. Smith's website. Similar but  
differently named fonts are now available: http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/index.html
