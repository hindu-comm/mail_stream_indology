And a number of their e-texts are based on the Vaidya editions --  generally 
reprints of older editions by others.

Subject: Re: digital Sanskrit Buddhist canon:Madhyamakavatara


One can hardly overestimate the utility of the "digital Sanskrit Buddhist 
canon" but its choice of edition may leave a bit to be desired. For the 
Asokavadaana it depends on the popular Saahitya Akademi edition instead of 
Cowell-Neil's. There are some emendations in the former that seem 
unnecessary. I have not checked any other work. DB
