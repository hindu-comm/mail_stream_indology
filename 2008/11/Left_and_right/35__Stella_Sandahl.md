> A friend of mine just asked me the following question:
  "historically, how do Indian traditions look at the ideas of left  
(or left-hand) and right (right-hand)?"
I have no idea. Does anybody know how the notion of the left  hand  
being inauspicious etc.  came about?
Latin sinistra seems to have the same connotations.
