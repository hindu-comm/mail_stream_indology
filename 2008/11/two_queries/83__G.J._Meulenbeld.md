Dear colleague,

Good colour pictures of vibhiitaka nuts are also found in:
Quality standards of Indian medicinal plants, vol. I, 198, Indian Council of 
Medical Research, New Delhi 2003 (co-ordinator: A.K. Gupta).and in:
Y.K. Sarin, Illustrated maual of herbal drugs used in Ayurveda, fig. 128 (a 
joint publication of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and 
Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi 1996).

I hope this will be of use,

Jan Meulenbeld
