One more item: if you are using an extended US-Keyboard on Mac OS X-5  
and a Unicode font such as Palatino (comes with the system), there are  
built-in combination keys for Skt. diacritics (for both capital and  
lowecase letters)

OPT-w + letter = overdot
OPT-x  + letter = underdot
OPT-e  + letter = accented letter (as in Śiva)
OPT-a  + vowel = long vowel
OPT-a + r long vowel r.
OPT-n + n of course yields palatal n.
I'm not sure about anunasika. You can probably compose it with the non- 
spacing character̆  .

I was unable to get Gandhari Unicode to work in OpenOffice on a Linux
platform. Fortunately, plenty of other Unicode fonts work quite well.
