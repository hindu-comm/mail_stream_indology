I should correct myself. The relevant page from Har Dayal's book is page 9.
But the link I have given works and thus one can check the reference.

Thanks for the information. I discussed the matter with Dr.Gaurishwar
Bhattacharya a few years ago. He also published a paper on the matter in
Bengali in 2004. He mentioned Schlingloff and a host of Indian and Western
scholars starting from Lüders.in the paper and also orally to me but not
HarDayal. No derivation from satvan toowas proposed by him.It will be
very convenient if information about the publication are made known to us.

The hypothesis that sattva in bodhisattva, mahaasattva,
etc., might be related to satvan was already advanced
by Har Dayal some 70 years ago. I suggest a review of
his work on the part of those who are interested.

Before jumping to conclusions based on the ms. evidence
of satva, instead of sattva, I would suggest verifying
whether or not the same orthography is found in the
case of the word sattva, as in sarvasattva- "all living
beings." In this case proposed derivations from zakta, satvan,
etc., do not seem plausible; and if sattva in
this usage is also spelled satva, it would seem to at least
call into question the impulse to treat bodhisat(t)va as
a special case.
