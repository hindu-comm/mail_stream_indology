Dear Allen,

    If I remember correctly, it is said that there are two types of 
vows: actual and aspirational, that is, those that are actually 
accomplishable, and others that are merely aspirational.  This vow 
would fall into the latter category because it is not possible to 
actually fulfill it.
    I can't remember the exact reference, possibly Tsong-kha-pa's 
Lam-rim-chen-mo, but if I find it I'll post it.

regards,

Paul Hackett
Columbia University
