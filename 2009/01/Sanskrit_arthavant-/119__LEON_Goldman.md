Dear List members,

Would anyone know if Skt. arthavant- ever occurs in a legal context to mean
'plaintiff' or 'defendant' or 'litigant' (lit. 'one characterised by the
artha- or lawsuit)?
I ask because in Avestan we find arethauuant- and arethamant- (both hapax
legomena) used in such a context, though with somewhat unclear meanings. I
was hoping a Sanskrit parallel might help to shed some light on these forms.
With thanks,
Leon Goldman (PhD candidate, SOAS).
