> Dear esteemed scholars,

> I am preparing a list of all Jainism courses being taught in North America,
> Europe, India, and elsewhere. If you or someone you know has taught a
> standalone Jainism course (a full course on Jainism, not as a part of south
> asian course), please email me offlist, thanks!

> other Jain books: http://www.JainLibrary.org <http://www.jainlibrary.org/>

> books have very good scan quality and 600 books have average scan quality.
