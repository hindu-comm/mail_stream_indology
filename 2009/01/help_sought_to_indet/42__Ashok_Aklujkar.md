Probably the oldest available reference to the phenomenon concerned is in
the V.rtti on Vaakyapadiiya/Trikaa.n.dii 1.95 (bhaagavatsv api te.sv eva
...). Kindly check the text there and ;Srii-v.r.sabha's commentary thereto
and see if, taken along with the other references you now have, the
Bhart.r-hari reference helps you in understanding the phenomenon.
