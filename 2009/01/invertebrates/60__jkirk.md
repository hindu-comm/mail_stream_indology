Looking with a magnifier, the little orange object in the river
has a tiny man-like being rising out of it and two humanoid legs
below it--as though the conch was an integral part of the being.

here is an example from the University of Virginia Art Museum

Unfortunately rather small, and I'm not sure I see the conch,
unless it is the orange object floating in the river in the
bottom left of the painting.

All best,
