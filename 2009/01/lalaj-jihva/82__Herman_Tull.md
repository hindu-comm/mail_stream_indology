I am looking for references to Kali's "lolling" tongue.  The Devi Mahatmya 
and the Mahabhagavata Purana (thanks to Patricia Dold for references) use 
forms of /lal + jihva (lalana/lalaj-jihva).  MW cites the Kathasaritsagara 
as a source of lalaj-jihva.  Does anyone has this citation?  Does this 
descriptive term ("lolling" tongue) occur in reference to other 
figures/goddesses?

Thanks for your help.
