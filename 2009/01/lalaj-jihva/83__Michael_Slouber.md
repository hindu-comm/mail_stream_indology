Many early tantras describe lolling the tongue in various contexts.   
The earliest may be the Picumata-Brahmayāmala (c.7th cent. CE) where  
there is instruction for the practitioner to loll his tongue as part  
of the ritual.  This comes up in at least half a dozen other tantras  
too.  In the Kriyākālaguṇottara (pre-11th cent.), lolling the  
tongue occurs in several contexts: an attribute of someone is  
possessed by a Nāga, as an attribute of Khaḍgarāvaṇa (also in a  
mantra to cause the piśācas to dance on his "lolajihva"), as an  
attribute of Devatrāsa, and as an attribute of a bālagraha named  
Tridaṇḍī.
