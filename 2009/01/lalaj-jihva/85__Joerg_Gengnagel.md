This might not be directly linked to your question but since you  
mentioned other figures:
In Kashikhanda 72.94-100 64 Vetaalas are mentioned, Lalajjihva is  
included in the list.
On SukulaÂ´s map Kashidarpana (1876) Lalajjihva is given in a spatial  
sequence as the second Vetaala of a group of eight in the east.
You might wish to see the entry on the map: www.benares.uni-hd.de (on  
map 69 - popup S92).

Zitat von Herman Tull <hwtull at MSN.COM>:

> I am looking for references to Kali's "lolling" tongue.  The Devi
> Mahatmya and the Mahabhagavata Purana (thanks to Patricia Dold for
> references) use forms of /lal + jihva (lalana/lalaj-jihva).  MW cites
> the Kathasaritsagara as a source of lalaj-jihva.  Does anyone has this
> citation?  Does this descriptive term ("lolling" tongue) occur in
> reference to other figures/goddesses?
