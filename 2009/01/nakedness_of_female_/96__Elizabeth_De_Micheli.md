Dear Tim,

_The Mystics, Ascetics, and Saints of India. A Study of Sadhuism,  
with an Account of the Yogis, Sanyasis, Bairagis, and other strange  
Hindu Sectarians_  By John Campbell Oman, Published by Adamant Media  
Corporation, ISBN 1402167466, 9781402167461
[orig pub. London, T F Unwin, 1903]

has a brief passage narrating his encounter with a small group of  
sadhus including a semi-naked (waist up) female sannyasini. There is  
also a photo of the group (fig 13 facing page 229). There are  
interesting reactions from the local population (taking darsan and  
giving offering), while 'modernist' members of the Arya Samay are  
outraged by the sadhus' nakedness.

I can see the work (including photos) on Google book search.

Best regards
Elizabeth De Michelis
