Dear List,

Having recently published a translation of the Bhagavad Gita [=BhG], I 
have recently received requests to review some recent translations and 
studies of this most important of Indological texts.  In order to do an 
adequate job at this task I would like to know the full record of recent 
genuinely *scholarly* translations of the BhG in all languages other 
than English, produced over the last generation or two. 

Please forward all references to me privately, so as not to overburden 
the list email system.  I will collect all references and post them to 
the list in an appropriate form.  Perhaps this will be of use to the 
list in general.

Of course, if this research has already been done, please refer me to it 
quietly.

Sincerely,

George Thompson
