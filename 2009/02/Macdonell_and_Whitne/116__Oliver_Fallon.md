Does anyone on the list have information on the availability of etexts of:

Macdonell: A Sanskrit Grammar for Students

and 

Whitney: Sanskrit Grammar |(5th ed. 1924)

I already have the scanned pdfs but it would be very useful to get an accurate text document of either of these works. Surely this is a desideratum  to compliment available versions of Whitney's Roots and MW's Dictionary?

With thanks,
