Dear Al,

A few suggestions are made on the SARIT help page:

 SARIT: Search Term Help
 http://sarit.indology.info/searchterms.shtml

especially here:

 SARIT: Search Term Help :: Diacritics and Special Characters
 http://sarit.indology.info/searchterms.shtml#diacritics

The upshot is that you have three options:

1.) enter utf-8 characters directly using a suitable keyboard input
 layout (possibly complex yet fast, see links below)

2.) cut and paste utf-8 characters from the key alongside or below the
 main search form (slow and bound to irritate)

3.) enter utf-8 characters indirectly using postfix modifiers

For speed and simplicity I would choose the last. (Personally, I like
postfix modifiers and have never used keyboard input layouts, though I
know many people are fond of them.)

Here is a list of the postfix modifiers available for Romanised Skt
(really just Harvard-Kyoto without the uppercase):

long a (ā) = a; 
long i (ī) = i; 
long u (ū) = u; 
vocalic r (ṛ) = r; 
vocalic l (ḷ) = l; 
velar n (ṅ) = g; 
palatal n (ñ) = j; 
retroflex t (ṭ) = t; 
retroflex d (ḍ) = d; 
retroflex n (ṇ) = n; 
palatal s (ś) = z; 
retroflex s (ṣ) = s; 
anusvara (ṁ) = m; 
visarga (ḥ) = h; 
circumflex = ^ :: e.g., a^ --> â 

Using these modifiers you could search for `kauṭilīya' (kauTilIya) by
entering either of the following in the search field:

i.) kauṭilīya (utf-8)

Here is the search result: http://tinyurl.com/dmgupa

ii.) kaut;ili;ya (postfix modifiers)

Ditto: http://tinyurl.com/cnkmu9


The SARIT search help page contains a number of other suggestions and
examples, together with links to representative search results. You
might like to scan the `Wildcard Characters and Boolean Operators'
section (not half as tedious as the title I promise).
