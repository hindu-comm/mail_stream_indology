http://bombay.indology.info is John Smith's website (guest hosted by 
INDOLOGY).  There you can find the IndUni font family, which are very 
finely designed and optimized for Indic transliteration.  John also makes 
available a very convenient keyboard handler for Windows (that's what I 
use) and another for the Mac.  Using the IndUni unicode fonts (or any 
Unicode font) and the keyboard handler makes it extremely easy to type 
romanized Sanskrit. (RightAlt+a = ā (a-macron), etc.)  John has done us 
all a great service.

There are probably several other keyboard systems and fonts out there if 
one searches, but I can vouch for the simplicity and excellence of John's 
under Windows.  I haven't used the Mac one.

If you're using Linux, there's a nice system that works with SCIM 
(http://www.scim-im.org/), called m17n (http://www.m17n.org/m17n-lib-en/). 
A bit cryptic to install, but in fact easy, and also very easy to modify 
for oneself.

Best,
Dominik
