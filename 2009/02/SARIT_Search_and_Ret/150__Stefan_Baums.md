There is also Andrew Glass’s Keyman input method for Windows. It
uses the left Alt key to compose diacritics, but otherwise should
work similarly to John Smith’s. In either case, keyboard handling
is independent of the font you use, so you can separately choose
the font and input method that you like best.

If you are using Linux, another route would be SCIM + KMFL, which
may be a bit easier to install than SCIM + M17N. There is a KMFL
version of Andrew’s Keyman layout, and I made a KMFL version of my
own input method (= a for ā, ' s for ś, etc.). Drop me a line if
you are interested in either of these (and we should probably also
make them available on our project website).

Best wishes,
Stefan
