Hello,
ISM fonts of C-DAC are available for Sanskrit(DV) and Diacritic Roman(DV1).
Only thing is that you have to learn the keyboard outlay.

Quoting Alfred Collins <acollins at GCI.NET>:

>  Dear Dr. Wujastyk,

> Could you explain the SARIT method of entering transliterated   
> Sanskrit in the following way:
> "enter utf-8 characters directly using a suitable keyboard input layout"?
> Is there a site you could direct me to that would show how to enter   
> Sanskrit letters by assigning keyboard strokes to them, not just for  
>  SARIT but to type diacritics in Word, etc. I have been typing   
> retroflex t, etc., using a Sanskrit font then selecting characters   
> from a Symbol menu. this is very cumbersome and slow.
>
> Hope my question is clear.

> Thanks,
