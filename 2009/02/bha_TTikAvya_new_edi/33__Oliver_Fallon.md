Dear List Members,

Published by the Clay Sanskrit Library (www.claysanskritlibrary.org):

Bhatti's Poem: The Death of Ravana

http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volume-v-78.html

Romanised text and facing page translation. The translation is literal enough to be a useful study aid. 

The Bhaṭṭikāvya provides a systematic illustration of large sections of Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī. The sūtras illustrated in each verse are given in the notes so that it is possible to read the Bhaṭṭikāvya in conjunction with a commentary such as the Kāśikā or a derivative work such as the Siddhāntakaumudī. In many cases Bhaṭṭi uses the exact words or phrases that are also the standard examples in the commentaries.

There are notes giving references to alaṃkāra texts for Canto 10 which illustrates the figures of speech.

Significant variants are discussed in the notes.

It also happens to be a damn good poem.
