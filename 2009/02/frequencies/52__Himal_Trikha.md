Two pdf-files containing lists of 100 and 3200 words respectively can be 
downloaded here:

http://www.indologie.uni-halle.de/studium/Studienmaterialien/index.htm

The lists are called basic vocabulary ("Sanskrit Grundwortschatz"). I 
don't know on what criteria the words were selected.

Best regards
Himal Trikha
