These are very interesting, and no doubt useful. But a quick glance will
assure anyone that they are not based on frequency. Is it possible that
ká¹£ura is one of the most common words in Skt? It seems to me more likely--I
didn't look around to see if this is explained--that this is vocabulary for
some reader. So the question of the collection of 'basic vocabulary' in the
sense of a list of the most frequent  words (perhaps by genre?) remains a
desideratum. But some linguistic must have compiled such a list, no?
