This is how Abhyaakara tells his name in the first verse of the Vajraavalii
+ni.spratyūham ihābhayasya mahasā vajrāvalī mīlatu 
The proprer name has been translated in the Tibetan version
bjigs.pa. medpahi.mthu.yis.bgegs.med.hdir.ni.rdo.rje.phre´.ba.hdu.bar.śog 
Praj;naakara ends the Bodhicaryaavataarapa;njikaa 
ma;nju;sriir iva sadgu.navasati.h praj;naakaro jaayataam
There was no fixed rule. Poets writing in NIA languages took recourse to refrains occurring at regular intervals

    Perhaps the instance you are thinking of 
occurs in the first of CandrakIrti's closing 
verses to his _yuktiSaSTikA-vRtti_:

klu yi rkyen yin 'jigs dang bcas pas yongs spangs pa
