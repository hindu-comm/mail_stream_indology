Dear Indologists,

Thank you so much for the bangle angle. Any new thoughts as they  
jingle and clink into consciousness would be most gratefully received.

I am trying to remember a poem in Hindi about  a man thinking of his  
lover as he finds a fragment of her bangle in his bed. . .  anyone  
know what I am talking about??

Thanks!!
Mary
