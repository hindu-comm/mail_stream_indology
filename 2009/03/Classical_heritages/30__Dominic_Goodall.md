The NMM database reveals that it has not been covering quite a number  
of larger MS collections so far.

Oblation into fire is also an option.  The following is from  
Trilocana"siva's C12th Praaya"scittasamuccaya (currently being edited  
by Dr. R. Sathyanarayanan in Pondicherry):

jiir.naa"nga.m yat svasiddhaanta.m pustaka.m tad gh.rtaaplutam|
agniku.n.de tu hotavya.m hutvaaghora"sata.m japet|| 188||

`A manuscript of one's own tradition that is worn in parts should be  
suffused with ghee and oblated in the fire-pit.  After oblating it,  
one should recite the aghora-mantra 100 times.'
