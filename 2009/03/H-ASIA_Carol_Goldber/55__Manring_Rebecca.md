I just heard this horrible, unbelievable news here in Albuquerque at the AOS reception.  Carol was my adiguru.  She taught me Bengali for four years, privately, for the ridiculous sum of $8/hour, back in the eighties.  But it was enough to qualify me for an AIIS advanced language fellowship, and the rest as they say is history.  I have very fond memories of riding my bike over to the Salomon's house in Seattle three nights a week for so long, dodging  Jesse and Rich playing football in the living room, and heading for her study to work for an hour.
Like most of us I was blessed with wonderful teachers at every turn, but she was the first, without whom I would probably not have proceeded in the directions I eventually did.

This is a tremendous loss for all of us; Carol taught an awful lot of us Bangla.  And my thoughts and prayers are with Richard and Jesse in this horrible time.

Carol Goldberg Salomon (July 28, 1948-March 13, 2009)
************************************************************************
>â€‰From Frank Conlon <conlon at u.washington.edu>

It is my very sad duty to report the death this morning, March 13, 2009,
of Carol Goldberg Salomon of the Department of Asian Languages  and
Literature of the University of Washington.  Carol had been injured
severely in a bicycle-automobile collision on March 11.  She is survived
by her husband, Professor Richard Salomon, also of the University of
Washington and their son Jesse.  A private funeral service is planned.

Dr. Salomon was a world-renowned specialist in the language, literature,
and culture of Bengal.  At the time of her death she held the position of
Senior Lecturer in Bengali.

Carol Salomon was a wonderful colleague who supported her students and
colleagues with intellectual and emotional support.  A graduate of City
College of New York (1970), she completed her PhD at the University of
Pennsylvania in Bengali Language and Literature in 1983.

Her special emphasis had been on the cultural synthesis of Bangla culture
as represented in the traditions of the Bauls.  Among her publications
were:

Studies in South Asian Devotional Literature, Language, and Culture , eds.
Alan Entwistle and Carol Salomon with Heidi Pauwels and Michael Shapiro.
New Delhi: Manohar, 1999.

"The Bauls" in Religions in India in Practice , ed. Donald S. Lopez, Jr.
Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995, pp. 187-208.

"The Cosmogonic Riddles of Lalan Fakir," in Gender, Genre and Power in
South Asian Expressive Traditions , ed. Arjun Appadurai, Frank Korom, and
Margaret Mills. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1991, pp.
267-304.

At the time of her passing she was working on a "City of Mirrors: An
Edition and Annotated Translation of Selected Songs by Lalan Fakir"

The sudden and unexpected loss of this brilliant colleague has left a
sense of loss more readily acknowledged than described.
