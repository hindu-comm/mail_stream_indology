Subject: Krishna as Vishnu

Friends:



I am researching multi-arm images of Krishna.



It seems to be that at some point Krishna ceases to be an avatara and
becomes Vishnu himself.



A case in point is Jagganath Puri where Krishna is Jagganath, an appellation
reserved for Vishnu.



A Nepali stone image (?12 th century) that I recently saw shows Krishna with
8 arms holding even a Sudarshan chakra.



Am I on the right track? Any help would be appreciated.



Regards.
