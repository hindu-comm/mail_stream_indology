A large number of Norwegian doctoral theses and scholarly papers are written
in English as a matter of course. Now exhortations are handed out to use
Norwegian, so that Norwegian should not wither and die as a language for
academic purposes.

A pretty hopeless proposition, by the way, since most people outside
Scandinavia are unable to read Norwegian. 

Best regards

Lars Martin Fosse
