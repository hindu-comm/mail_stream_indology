The line is found in Uttarajjhaya 9.14/242, in Prakrit (but withour diacritics):

mihilae dajjhamanie na me dajjhai kimcana.

Here (at home) I do not have access to Gustav Roth's "Dhammapada verses in Uttarajjhaya". Sambodhi 5, 2-3 (1976), pp. 166-9, who refers to the Mahabharata and Dhammapada parallels. If you wish I can mail you the references tomorrow

Kind regards

Herman Tieken
