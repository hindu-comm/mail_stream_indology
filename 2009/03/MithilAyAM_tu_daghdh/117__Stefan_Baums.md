In addition to the MBh and Uttarajjhāyā references provided by
Professors Aklujkar and Tieken, the half‐verse in question occurs
in Udānavarga 30.44:

   susukham bata jīvāmo   yeṣāṃ no nāsti kiñcanaṃ
   mithilāyāṃ dahyamānāyāṃ   na no dahyati kiñcanaṃ

and in Mahāvastu III 453.1–2:

   mithilāyāṃ dahyamānāyāṃ   nāsya dahyati kiṃcana
   caturthaṃ khu bhadram adhanasya   anāgārasya bhikṣuṇo

I happen to have a scan of the Roth article which I will send to
Allen in separate email.

I wonder why Mithilā figures in this proverbial expression.

All best,
Stefan
