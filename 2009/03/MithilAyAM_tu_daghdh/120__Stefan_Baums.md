Dear Allen,

> Mithila was just taken as the greatest and richest city

that may well be the case. There is also a Jātaka version of the
Mahāvastu verse (Ja V 252.28–29) which just uses “city” without
giving it a name:

   pañcamaṃ bhadram adhanassa   anāgārassa bhikkhuno
   nagaramhi ḍayhamānamhi   nāssa kiñ ci aḍayhatha

Best regards,
Stefan
