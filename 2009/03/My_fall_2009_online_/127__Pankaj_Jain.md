With immense gratitude to my supervisors and colleagues at NC State, I am 
excited to share that my two courses here will also have an online 
section. Thus, students from anywhere in the world can log into the class 
and can take these classes. I will greatly appreciate your help in letting 
any interested students know about these courses.
