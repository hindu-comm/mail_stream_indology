Dear Colleagues,

Richard Mahoney and I would like to thank all those of you who very kindly 
penned letters of support for the SARIT application that we are making to 
the British Association for South Asian Studies.  They have all gone off 
to the committee now, and we await the decision with bated breath.

Best wishes, and thanks again,

Dominik Wujastyk and pp Richard Mahoney
