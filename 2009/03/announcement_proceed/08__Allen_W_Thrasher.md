It's probably not important, but I want to clarify that when I said, "Anyway, modern languages differ radically in the extent to which they expand vocabulary by borrowing rather than by translation, invention from native vocabulary, calqueing, or the like, don't they?,"  I was referring to modern languages throughout the world, not specifically modern South Asian languages.
