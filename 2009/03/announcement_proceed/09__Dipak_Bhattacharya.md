As I see it Dr.Thrasher's ideaiscorrect. It is the Grierson like surprise and obliviousnress about the situtaion in Europe ieGreco-Latin :: West European languages (exclude German)that puzzle me. In any case mine was not an accusation but just a call attention note. Greetings for all!

It's probably not important, but I want to clarify that when I said, "Anyway, modern languages differ radically in the extent to which they expand vocabulary by borrowing rather than by translation, invention from native vocabulary, calqueing, or the like, don't they?," I was referring to modern languages throughout the world, not specifically modern South Asian languages.
