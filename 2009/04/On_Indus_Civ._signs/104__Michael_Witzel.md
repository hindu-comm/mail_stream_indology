QED of what I said about journalists. Advice : use equal scrutiny  
with regard to the rest of what they write:

Half-understood and sensation-geared. Or brain-dead, as in this case.

---

Instead, we will have a *serious* discussion of these points at our  
12th Round Table at Kyoto, May 30-31, in front of many archaeologists  
from the subcontinent, America, Europe and Japan...

See: <http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/12thRT.htm>

We will report then.

Cheers,

Michael
