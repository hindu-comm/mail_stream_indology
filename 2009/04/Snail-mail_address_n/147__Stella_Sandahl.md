Dear colleagues,
Does anybody have the snail-mail address (preferably residence)  to  
Sheela Verma? She kindly sent me her book  Magahi Folklore and Folk  
Tales and I would like to send her a letter of thanks (in the old- 
fashioned hand written way).
Please reply off list to ssandahl at sympatico.ca!  Many thanks!
Stella Sandahl
