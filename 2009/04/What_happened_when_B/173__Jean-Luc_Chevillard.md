Dear SP,

I agree that the fact that inscriptions use "n" or "ṉ" is not a 
significant issue. I just mentionned it for the sake of completion;

Regarding your two earlier posts (the first one dated 14 Aug 1999 and 
the second one dated 10 Aug 2006),
they contain indeed a lot of interesting data, some of which seems to be 
interpretable using the "vṛddha vs. yuvan" distinction which was evoked 
at the beginning of the thread and commented upon by Professor Cardona:
in 
<http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0904&L=indology&D=1&O=D&F=P&P=4372>.

You write (in your 1999 post [converted to Unicode, hopefully without 
mistakes])

<BEGIN QUOTE: SP: Aug 1999>
There are three Classical Tamil poets from Madurai with the following 
names: pālāciriyar nappālaṉār, pālāciriyar naṟṟāmaṉār, pālāciriyaṉ 
cēntaṉ koṟṟaṉār

Regarding each of these U. V. Saminataiyar  suggests they were probably 
teachers of children, based on Ta. pāla < Skt. bāla (caṅkakālap 
pulavarkaḷ, p.342-3). The Tamil Lexicon also interprets it in the same 
manner.

However, a study of Tamil inscriptions reveals that pālāciriyaṉ is a 
variant of Tamilized pārāśarya, ie., one who belonged to the lineage of 
parāśara/śrī.

An inscription, SII vol. 17, no. 598, of the period of Kulottunga Chola 
II (12 th century) gives three variants of the same name as:
pārāciriaṉ, pārāśrīaṉ, pālāśrīaṉ

When considered along with other names in the inscription, it is obvious 
that it is a gotra name. There are other inscriptions which give the 
variant pālāciriaṉ. Another inscription gives the variant pārācarian.

This will help us correctly interpret the name of another CT poet 
"maturai iḷampālāciriyaṉ cēntaṉ kūttaṉār". UVS intreprets the name as 
teacher cēntaṉ kūttaṉ who was originally from the place called iḷampāl 
and later
settled in Madurai. The correct interpretation should be, "cēntaṉ 
kūttaṉ, the young  one of the lineage of parāśara/śrī".

We have other poets with part of the names derived from gotra names such as:

maturai iḷaṅkaucikaṉār (kauśika) ,

ko/ōṭimaṅkalam vātuḷi naṟcēntaṉār (vādhūla) ,

kācipaṉ kīraṉār (kāśyapa) ,

kaṭampaṉūrc cāṇṭiliyaṉār (śāṇḍilya),

taṅkāl āttirēyaṉ ceṅkaṇṇaṉār (ātreya)

Similarly, CT poet kōṉāṭṭu eṟiccilūr māṭalaṉ maturaikkkumaraṉār and 
māṭala maṟaiyōṉ of Cilappatikāram were brahmins of the māḍala gotra 
which is one of the gotras listed by Chitralekha Gupta in "The Brahmanas 
of India., 1983, p.117. Similarly, tolkāppiyaṉ probably belonged to 
kāpi/kāpya gotra. Both māṭalaṉ and kāppiyaṉ occur in inscriptions.

<END QUOTE: SP: Aug 1999>

Do I understand you correctly if I say that you think that the "vṛddha 
vs. yuvan" distinction (i.e. "gārgya" vs. "gārgyāyaṇa"), could be 
expressed in Tamil, AT LEAST in the cases WHEN it was felt NECESSARY, by 
making use of /tol/ ("ancient, senior") and /iḷam/ ("young, junior") 
components of the long names.

In that case, the forms you quote, /iḷampālāciriyaṉ/ and 
/iḷaṅkaucikaṉār/ are the Tamil equivalent of /yuvan/ forms.

Similarly, /tolkāppiyaṉ/ could be the Tamil equivalent of a /vṛddha/ form.

Is this what you mean?

Best wishes
