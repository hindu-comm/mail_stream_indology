Yes, I tried this, but what got saved on the disk was the html wrapper, 
without the digital image of the page.  But since you've had success, 
there must be some way round it on a PC (winXP) too.

Why is it reasonable to allow the above process but not a single download 
of per-article PDFs?  Either they are releasing these materials or they 
are not.  Since they are (and it's wonderful and we're all incredibly 
grateful), then it would be kind of them to serve the needs of working 
scholars more appropriately.  Like almost all other online journals, or 
JSTOR, for example.

Best,
