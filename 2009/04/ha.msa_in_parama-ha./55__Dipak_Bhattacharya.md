Many thanks! The imagery of hamsa is of course Rgvedic. The sun too is in picture there. But I did not find hamsa as the binder of the material world and the divine one before the AV verse cited. There is an implied theoretical comprehension of two interdependentworlds along with hamsa playing a unique role that makes the AV concept look theologically more developed.

RV 10.124.9
bībhatsū́nāṃ sayújaṃ haṃsám āhur apā́ṃ divyā́nāṃ sakhiyé cárantam
anuṣṭúbham ánu carcūryámāṇam índraṃ ní cikyuḥ kaváyo manīṣā́

and RV 4.40.5
haṃsáḥ śuciṣád vásur antarikṣasád dhótā vediṣád átithir duroṇasát
nr̥ṣád varasád r̥tasád víomasád abjā́gojā́r̥tajā́adrijā́r̥tám

The first one describes in this way Indra identified with the sun; the
second one describes the horse DadhikrA'van identified with the sun and
Agni. In both cases 'swan' refers to the divine being who is in the sky
or in the space. At RV 10.124.9 the god is cognised by the seers, at RV
4.40.5 the horse remains within men (nr̥ṣád) which also implies
possibility of its cognition (if not its ontic presence within human
beings).

These Vedic antecedents include not only the oldest upanisads [BAU, ChU], as well as later upanisads [KaU & ShvetU] but many YV texts as well [KS, MS, VS, TB].But even in oldest Vedic [RV] the term hamsa is already well-attested [16 times] and in every stratum of the RV.

Of course, these linguistic origins do not tell us what sort of bird the Sanskrit term hamsa refers to, but they do suggest
