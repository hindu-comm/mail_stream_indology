Hi, Peter,

The Bhelasamhita is unique in being an ancient Skt text that locates mind, 
manas, in the head (between the palate and the skull).  References in 
Bhelasamhita ch.8, e.g.,

śirastālvantaragataṃ sarvendriyaparaṃ manaḥ 2cd

and

ūrdhvaṃ prakupitā doṣāḥ śirastālvantare sthitāḥ 10ab

Best,
Dominik

?? Nowadays in Hindi mana means both the heart and the mind, but I am not sure when it began its migration up into the head as it is now imagined. In particular was it only under the influence of western thought or are there pre-colonial period texts which speak of the seat of thought as being in the head?
