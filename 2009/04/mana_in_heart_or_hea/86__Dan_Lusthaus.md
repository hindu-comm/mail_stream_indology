unmāda.

If the head/brain can be considered a vital organ (Dominik suggested not),
then Asanga has this covered, or at least implied in his definition of
unmāda in the Mano-bhūmi of the Yogācārabhūmi:


katham unmādyati | pūrva-karmākṣepatayā dhātu-vaisamyataya uttrāsa-bhayatayā
marmābhighāta-tayā bhūta-samāveśatayā ||



Or does marmābhighāta have a clearly defined denotation in the medical
literature? In any case, I find his definition intriguing.
