This is very interesting indeed.  The classical āyurvedic text of Vāgbhaṭa 
and other older texts talk about six causes (3 humours, humoral 
conjunction, anguish, poison) leading to damage of the tubes that carry 
manas and thus unmāda.  Uttaratantra, adhyāya 6:

unmādāḥ ṣaṭ pṛthagdoṣanicayādhiviṣodbhavāḥ
unmādo nāma manaso doṣair unmārgagair madaḥ 1

śārīramānasair duṣṭair ahitād annapānataḥ
vikṛtāsātmyasamalād viṣamād upayogataḥ 2

viṣaṇṇasyālpasattvasya vyādhivegasamudgamāt
kṣīṇasya ceṣṭāvaiṣamyāt pūjyapūjāvyatikramāt 3

ādhibhiścittavibhraṃśād viṣeṇopaviṣeṇa ca
ebhir hi hīnasattvasya hṛdi doṣāḥ pradūṣitāḥ 4

dhiyo vidhāya kāluṣyaṃ hatvā mārgān manovahān
unmādaṃ kurvate tena dhīvijñānasmṛtibhramāt 5

Ayurveda).
