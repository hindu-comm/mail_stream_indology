Dear All,

thanks to all who commented on the pramanas till now.

The terms are in Pali (I only gave the Skt. terms for convenience),  
the expression is paccakkhānumānasaddatthāpattippabhedassa  
pamāṇacatukassāpariccāgī, and it is to be found in Vajirabuddhi| 
s Vajirabuddhiṭīkā (Chaṭṭhasaṅgāyana edition 3,22-23), i.e.  
in an undated  subcommentary on the Vinaya.
	Vajirabuddhi here comments on the expression catukkam apariccāgī,  
which forms part of a verse given by him in the very beginning of the  
text, and characterizing a vattā (vaktṛ). In Pali this verse to my  
knowledge is documented only a second time in the 9th century  
Mahāniddesa-Aṭṭhakathā, and only these two texts comment on it.  
The Vajirabuddhiṭīkā gives three explanations, one of wich is the  
pramāṇa-tetrad. The Nidd-a has two identical explanations, only the  
pramāṇa-tetrad is missing.

The mentioning of four pramāṇas is certainely conditioned by the  
catukkaṃ of the verse. However, I thought it highly unlikely that  
the author invented this list, and I hoped it would throw some light  
on his background and perhaps time (between 9th and 12th century),  
who possibly enjoyed a Sanskrit education, perhaps in South India.
