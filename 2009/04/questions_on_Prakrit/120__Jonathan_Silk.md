Dear colleagues,

This is not exactly (or not at all) a response to Matthew's query:


> 2. Can someone recommend a convenient guide to Prakrit
> prosody, similar to the appendix on Skt prosody in
> Apte's dictionary?
>

But for those who are not aware of it, rather buried as it is, an incredibly
informative piece is:

Hideaki Nakatani, "Metre and Euphony (sandhi) in the Nilamatapurana" in A
Study of the Nilamata - Aspects of Hinduism in Ancient Kashmir - edited by
Yasuke IKARI.  Institute for Research in Humanities, Kyoto University, 1994.


With best regards, Jonathan
