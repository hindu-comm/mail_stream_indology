H.D. Velankar: Chandonu'nus"saasana of Hemachandrasuuri (A  
comprehensive treatise of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhra.m"sa Prosody).  
Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan 1961 (Singhi Jain Series. 49).

It not only contains various exhaustive indices of Sanskrit metres (by  
far superior to Apte's useful appendix), but also has a "Classified  
List showing the Structure of Prakrit Metres" on pp. 336-364 (=  
Appendix II).
