In the logo of the Ramakrishna Mission a real swan also figures, not a
goose. Apparently in the nineteenth century one regarded the hansa as a
swan. The latter perhaps as an allusion to the image of the swan that will
sing its most beautiful song when it feels it is going to die; a famous
image found in Plato's Phaedo, 84e-85b? The idea in Phaedo is that Socrates
as a philosopher knows he is going to die and expects to be united with the
God Apollo.

It is a real "swan"  messenger that Raja Ravi 
Varma painted in his famous "Ha.msa-Damayantii" 
(1899) now displayed in the Sri Chitra Art 
Gallery, Tiruvanantapuram. See at:
