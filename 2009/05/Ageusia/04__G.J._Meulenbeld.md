Dear colleague,

Ageusia as a distinct syndrome is found in a late ayurvedic text, the 
Nigha.n.turatnaakara, compiled by Vi.s.nu Vaasudeva Go.dbole and his 
associates (see on this text my "History of Indian medical literature", IIA, 
365--368), bhaag duusraa 401:

bhu~njaanasya narasyaanna.m madhuraprabh.rtiin rasaan /

rasanaa yan na jaanaati rasaaj~naana.m tad ucyate //

Verses on its treatment follow.

The same verse on  rasaaj~naana, is also found in Vallabhendra's 
Vaidyacintaama.ni, a text of uncertain date but much earlier (see again IIA, 
481--489), chapter 10,  p.171 .

I hope this will help,

best wishes,

Jan Meulenbeld
