Dear Professor Silk,
Other sources failing, perhaps, an enquiry could be made at the Oriental Institute, Baroda or Librarian, MS University, Baroda. They took interest in U.P.Shah. The email id of the Institute are not known to me. But there are List members who could know.
Best wishes

Friends,

Apparently, the copy of Akota Bronzes by U P Shah supposedly purchased by
our library never made it into the collection, and the library has been
unable to replace it. Therefore, I wonder whether someone who has it to hand
would be willing to scan just a page or two for me. In particular, I am
interested in the bronze apparently found on pg. 34, plates 75a-b, and the
author's reading of its inscription (actually, I am only interested in the
inscription, not the piece itself :-) So a scan of the inscription, if
legible, and the editor's reading and translation would be great--many
thanks in advance!
