Dear Jonathan,

> the scribe/engraver appears indeed to have written not
> deyadharma- but devadharma-. Is this a common mistake?

yes, that happens. See p. 24 of:

   Heinrich Lüders, 1940. Zu und aus den Kharoṣṭhī‐Urkunden. Acta
   Orientalia 18: 15–49.

for three devadharmas in Kuṣāṇa‐period Sanskrit inscriptions from
a monastery in Mathura and one in a 10th/11th‐century inscription
from Bengal.

All best,
Stefan
