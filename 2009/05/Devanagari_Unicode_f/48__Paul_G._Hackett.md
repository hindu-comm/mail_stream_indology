Greetings,

I am attempting to typeset some Unicode Devanagari text in Adobe 
InDesign (CS3) on the Mac (OS X.5.6) but cannot seem to locate a 
Unicode font that will function correctly (i.e. form ligatures) in 
InDesign.  Does anyone know of any such font that will do so (free or 
otherwise)?

Thanks,
