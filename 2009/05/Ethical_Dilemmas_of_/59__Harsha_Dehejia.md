Friends:



Both the Mahabharata and the Shrimad Bhagvata Purana present situations in which Krishna is seen transgressing ethical norms.



In the Bhagavata this is resolved through the concept of  Yogamaya.



What is the resolution of these problems in the Mahabharata? Is the Karma Yoga of the Gita a possible resolution?



Thanks.
