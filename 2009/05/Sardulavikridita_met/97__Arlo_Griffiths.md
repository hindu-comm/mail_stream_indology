It is also important to note that there seems to be a strong tendency for placement of a ceasura after the fourth gaṇa.
The maṅgala in Śrīdhara's Karmapañjikā, whose critical edition is currently being prepared by Dr. S. Sumant (Pune) and myself, also presents an unexpected number of Śārdūlavikrīḍita pādas: just two of them, whereafter the verse-form seems to become something that is meant to be Sragdharā. I would be grateful references to similarly (un)structured maṅgalas. I paste below the text of Śrīdhara's maṅgala as we currently suppose it must be edited.
Best greetings,
Arlo Griffiths
