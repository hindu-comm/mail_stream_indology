Jonathan,

the "Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema" (Willemen/Rajadhyaksha) also has 
this as the first Indian film made in Sanskrit.

The encyclopedia entry tells the plot, and continues:

"Continuing his effort after "Hamsa Geethe" (1975) towards a brahminical 
revivalism, Iyer claimed to have made the film in Sanskrit to do justice 
to the abstraction of Shankara's philosophical thought. The film does 
away with the miracle scenes typical of the genre and deploys several 
symbolic figures (e.g. death and wisdom are both personified). The 
extensive musical track consists of Vedic chants. Iyer went on to make 
two more Saint films featuring two of Shankara's main disciples, 
Madhavacharya (Kannada, 1986) and Shri Ramanujacharya (Tamil, 1989). The 
film did not get a commercial release in India but apparently did very 
well in foreign markets." (p. 425)

Best,

Birgit
