In the last decade or two, a substantial amount of Sanskrit literature has 
become available in e-text form.  Veda, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Mahabhasya, 
Astadhyayi, Kasika, Puranas, many Tantras, dharmasastra and jyotisa texts, 
Buddhist literature, much else.

What next?  What text is there in Devanagari script that hasn't been input 
yet, and that you would dearly like to have as an e-text?  I wonder if we 
can put together a prioritized list?

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
