Dear Dominik and all,
Is there somewhere a list which kAvyas, mahAkAvyas and dramas are  
accessible as e-texts?
In particular, it would be very useful if all the major dramas WITh  
the Prakrit parts (and chAyA) could be easily accessible.

Also, judging by the programmes of the last three World Sanskrit  
Conferences it seems to me that les belles lettres are being neglected
in favour of grammar, philosophy, epics and Puranas.
Best regards to all
Stella Sandahl
