Not a Devanagari text so not relevent here, but it would be *immensely* 
helpful if Edgerton's Dictionary of Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit could ever be 
made into an e-text.  It would be a very big job, even with OCR and there 
may be problems with copyright still.  Or is there a secret copy already in 
private circulation ?

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
