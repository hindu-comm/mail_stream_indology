Among philosophical works, I have not so far found
e-texts of (pardon the omitted diacritical marks):

Santaraksita's Tattvasamgraha and its Panjika

Sarvadarsanasamgraha attr. to Sayanamadhava (or to Ceni Bhatta)

Haribhadrasuri's Saddarsanasamuccaya and its comms.

And very little Jaina philosophy in general seems 
so far available. The
encyclopedic nature of the three texts mentioned above, however,
recommends them I think rather strongly.
