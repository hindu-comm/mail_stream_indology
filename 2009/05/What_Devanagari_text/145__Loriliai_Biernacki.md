I'd really like to see some of the lesser studied Tantric texts, for
starters, the Gandharva Tantra and the several volumes available in the
Tantrasaṁgraha Series edited by V.V Dvivedi in the Yogatantra-Granthamālā
published by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University and Brahmānanda Giri's
Śāktānandataraṅgiṇī.
