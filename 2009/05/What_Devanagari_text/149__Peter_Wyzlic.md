Scanned versions (without searchable e-text) are made available by the  
Digital Library of India (Bangalore division). Unfortunately, the  
access is not very user-friendly (and the URLs are not easy to cite,  
therefore shortened here):

E.g. Tattvasaṃgraha vol. 1 ed. E. Krishnamacharya: <http://tinyurl.com/lgyr

Tattvasaṃgraha, vol. 2: <http://tinyurl.com/klsykq>
Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha ed. V.S. Abhyankar: <http://tinyurl.com/l4r2l9>
Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya ed. L. Suali: <http://tinyurl.com/m3hcux> and <http://tinyurl.com/m

In 2007, a Jain association in the US brought out two DVDs with Jaina  
e-texts and scans. It was called "Jaina e-Library". Their web address  
was or still is: http://www.jaina.org

Hope it helps
