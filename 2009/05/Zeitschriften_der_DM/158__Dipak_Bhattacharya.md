To Mr.Mark Allon

This is good advice. But it is not clear which type of file is meant as the 'convertee' and in which system. Are there not simpler ways of convertingword files of any system (Note Book, Wordpad, iLEAP etc, but not MS Dos) when the writer is installed in XP? One just 'Ctrl+p's and selects the pdf.option. Areyou speaking of Mac? It may be that my question is born of ignorance. Please do not hesitate to rectify.

Dear all,

You may already know this, but you can produce a pdf by the following method: save each page as a JPEG (right click > Save image as > JPEG), then convert these to pdfs and stitch them together. Bit time consuming, but better than nothing. 

Regards
Mark

In saving a page one is asked whether one wants to save only the 
frame, only the text or the whole website, etc.. The page of the 
respective article is only saved if you choose "complete website". At 
least that's the way I could save some articles.
