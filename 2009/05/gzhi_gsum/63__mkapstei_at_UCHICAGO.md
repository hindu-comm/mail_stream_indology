Dear Stephen,

It's indeed an interesting locution, particularly
given that the source text is Indic. I suspect you're
right to think that vastu is a better candidate than
bhaava, but have you ruled out aazraya? In any case,
if the Chinese versions are using sanbao throughout,
they're of no help at all here. Do you find anything
in the Turfan fragments edited by Waldschmidt?
