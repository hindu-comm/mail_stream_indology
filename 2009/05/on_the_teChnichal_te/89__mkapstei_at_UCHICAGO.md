On the questions raised in connection with
commentarial forms, it is now useful to consult
Tubb and Boose's excellent _Scholastic Sanskrit:
A Manual for Students_, esp. ch. 10.

Pratiika is defined on p. 152 (the index mistakenly
gives 150) as just "the first word or two, of
the passage in question." 

This seems to correspond with traditional usage.
