It is difficult to say without examining the passages concerned. But there is a regular practice of indicating thesection dealt with at the end of the discourse. See any commentariyon the Amarako.sa, (say,Bhānuji Dīk.sita) on any entry end eg., pañca śaileyasya śilājita iti khyātasya II.122,123a. But it is not being claimed that the same is the case with the Pali commentary. Please indicate ifthat practice is relevant

Dear All,

According to my experience the textual sequence in commentaries regularly is: text to be commented on (for instance a verse or list of terms), commentary on the words or terms of the preceding verse or list (pratīkas plus explanations). I now have a Pāli commentary where it is exactly the other way round (pratīkas plus explanations, followed by the text from which the pratīkas are extracted).

I would like to know whether this is a common feature in commentarial literature only unnoticed by me.

Would be thankful for any comments,
Petra
