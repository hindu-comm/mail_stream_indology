Dear Professor Houben,
Could you kindly let me know the if the term 'Chancelier', with reference to a French University, means what one understands by 'Vice-Chancellor' in India or by 'Rektor'in Holland or Germany. The French equivalent is 'Recteur', I heard somewhere.
Will you kindly clarify?
Best wishes
DB
