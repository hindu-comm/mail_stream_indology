Yes, I was going to suggest the same place.  It was in Gangwal Park, if I 
remember rightly (may be the same as the location mentioned below).  It 
was founded by "Vyakul" Sharma, who may be no more.  It's an extraordinary

alchemical texts, locks, stones, images, and much more.  It's a quirky 
personal collection, and richer for that, reminiscent of the Raj Dinkar 
Kelkar collection in Pune,
