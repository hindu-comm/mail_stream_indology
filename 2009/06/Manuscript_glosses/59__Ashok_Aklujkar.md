In the name avacuur.ni/nii used for a commentary or subcommentary type, the
intention behind using the prefix ava could originally have been to suggest
that the glosses are written below -- below the lines or in the lower parts
of pages. I recall seeing mss where the avacuur.ni was written in the lower
parts of pages, but I do not recall if the mss concerned were old or recent.

The avacuur.ni/.nii type seems to have been more common among the Jains and
in the central-western part of India (Gujarat-Rajasthan area).

My impression, however, is that corrections, additions and glosses are more
commonly written in the left and right margins.
