Regarding E-texts:

Does anyone know of the existence of an e-text of the Niilamatapuraa.na?

I have begun transcribing the two-volume publication of the text (Motilal 
Banarsidass, 1973) of Dr. Ved Kumari while reading through it, but have 
temporarily set this work aside in order to complete another project.

I will return to this if, indeed, no e-text of the work yet exists and no 
one else is doing the same work.
