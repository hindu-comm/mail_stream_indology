Dear Stephen,

copyright allowing, the one certainly doesnâ€™t rule out the
other. While we would like to have BHSD available in the same
search interface as our other dictionaries (and our own):

   http://ebmp.org/a_gdp.php

a flat digital text file can easily be extracted from that.

Cheers,
Stefan
