Dear  friends. I have a small query.
 how Out of africa (OOA) theory handles the problem of indo-european group
of languages had the european group seperated from that one bound to travel
to south asia. India and Europe share a language to some extant. it will be
difficult if they seperated 30000 years ago.

or is there any material on the OOA theory and Aryan invasion theory? OOA is
seperately dealt by DNA specialists. but has anybody from our clan tried to
do something?
