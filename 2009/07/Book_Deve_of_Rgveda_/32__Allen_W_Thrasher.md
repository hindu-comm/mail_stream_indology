Madhav,

I'd appreciate that.  I'd especially like to know if your ed. has any information besides the bare text.

Hello Allen,

    This "DEVE" collection of mantras is reasonably popular among the Vaidikas and these mantras are used as general blessing.  They have been published in pothi form in old times by Nirnayasagara.  I have a printed copy, though I will have to hunt it down.  Best,

Madhav
