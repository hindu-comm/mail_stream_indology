THE HISTORY OF GENEALOGY, THE GENEALOGY OF HISTORY: FAMILY AND THE
NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SIGNIFICANT PAST IN EARLY SOUTH ASIA

A four-day workshop at Cardiff University, from Wednesday 26th to Saturday
29th May 2010.

Confirmed keynote speakers: Greg Bailey, Alf Hiltebeitel, and Richard
Salomon.

CALL FOR PAPERS

Pre-modern South Asia has consistently but erroneously been presented as a
land without 'history'. The Genealogy and History project explores how, in
South Asia, 'family history' or 'genealogical narrative' has been an
enduring resource for the formation and transformation of understandings of
the past, present, and future.

The workshop's key research question is: What is the role of genealogical
narrative in pre-modern South Asia, and what is its relationship to other
ways of presenting the past?

Each participant will lead a one-hour session with a paper of 45 minutes.
The proceedings of the workshop will be published.

WE INVITE THE SUBMISSION OF ABSTRACTS ON THE TOPICS OF GENEALOGY,
HISTORIOGRAPHY, AND NARRATIVE APPROACHES TO THE PAST IN PRE-MODERN SOUTH
ASIA, ACROSS ANY AND ALL RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS, ON THE BASIS OF TEXTUAL AND
EPIGRAPHIC SOURCES.

The workshop is partially funded by the Arts and Humanities Research
Council. A fee of £120 per participant will be charged, which will include
accommodation (at St Michael's College, close to Llandaff Cathedral) and
meals.

Please email abstracts, before the end of September 2009, to James Hegarty
(hegartyj at cardiff.ac.uk) and/or Simon Brodbeck (brodbecksp at cardiff.ac.uk).

Please distribute this call for papers widely!
