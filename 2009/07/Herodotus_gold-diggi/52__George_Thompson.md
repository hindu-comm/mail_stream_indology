Hello Paul,

There was some discussion of Herodotus's gold-digging ants on the 
Indology list in November 1996, largely in response to Peissel.  If you 
search the list archives for peissel or gold eating ants or herodotus 
you will be able to find it.  Perhaps it will be of use.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
