This site has a good collection of poems of poets like Mahdevi Varma and 
Dinkar

You may want to search and Google Books 
<http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search>  , Internet Archive 
<http://www.archive.org/index.php>
and Digital Library of India <http://dli.iiit.ac.in/index.html>

A quick search didn't get me anything written by Mohan Rakesh that is 
digitized.
Thanks,
Bindu
