I forward the following information sent to me by Prof Victor Mair:

Ji Xianlin (季羡林), a renowned linguist, historian, and translator, died on 11
July 2009 at the age of 98. Ji was a specialist in ancient Indian languages
and Sino-Indian cultural exchange, and rendered major works, including the
Ramayana, into Chinese from the original Sanskrit .

Another great scholar of Indian religions (and former director of the
National Library), Ren Jiyu, also passed away recently
