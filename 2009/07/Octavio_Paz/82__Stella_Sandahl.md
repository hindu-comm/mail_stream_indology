Dear all,
I personally believe that Paz actually improved on Ingalls'  
translations. Paz' "translations" are of course unfaithful, but they  
are quite effective, especially the VallaNa one. After all, Octavio  
Paz was a great poet in his own right. I just wanted to know if he  
had actually taken his renderings of the verses I quoted  from  
somewhere else. That doesn't seem to be the case.
Thank you all for paying attention to this small issue.
Best wishes to all
Stella Sandahl
