My mistake.  I thank Harunaga Isaacson for the clarification.

> What Whitney Cox points to is a searchable version not of the CPD (Critical Pali
> Dictionary), but of the (useful but far less comprehensive, and less critical)
> PTS Pali-English Dictionary (of Rhys-Davids and Stede).
>
> The CPD, begun by Trenckner, on which generations of outstanding Pali scholars
> have worked, was and is a lexicographical project of an entirely different
> calibre.
