Dear Colleagues,
I am looking at the term chAyA which is used in Hindi to mean a translation which conveys the broad sense of an original, a kindof transcreation.
I seem to recall it can be used in this way in Sanskrit. 
I would be interested to know if I am I right and how long the term has been in use.
regards
Peter Friedlander
