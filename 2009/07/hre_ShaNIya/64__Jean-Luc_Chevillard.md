Dear Dagmar,

piling a question on a question,
I wonder whether what you describe might be linked with a question I 
asked on this same list in 2002

See
<http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0211&L=INDOLOGY&P=R4005&I=-3>

I elicited a few answers, such as:

(by Madhav Deshpande)

(by Peter Scharf)

It is possible that trying to describe what "laughing" is,
in a phonetic/scientific perspective
(without saying that it is "le propre de l'homme" :-)
is as difficult as explaining "kh, g and gh"
to a dravidian speaker (who knows only "k"),
and requires references to animal cries

I hope this is useful

Best wishes

-- Jean-Luc Chevillard
