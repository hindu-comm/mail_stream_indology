Several people have kindly requested a copy of my article on the history 
of cannabis in India.  A pre-publication draft PDF will be downloaded by 
clicking the link http://tinyurl.com/p2flzz There are some misprints and 
typos.  It's a draft of the lecture, not a final publication.

The published version appeared in
Ana Salema (ed.)
Ayurveda at the crossroads of care and cure. Proceedings of the 
Indo-European Seminar on Ayurveda held at Arrábida, Portugal, in November 
2001 (Lisbon, 2002).  See http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57478361

A reprint of this book is planned by Motilal Banarsidass.

A student of mine working on Atharvavedic herbal plants says that he has some evidence for the currency of opium or a drug producing similar effects in the Atharvaveda. That, he thinks, was not marijuana. The existing theory is that opium was introduced in India much later. Is there any study or theory that opium was developed independently in India? I will see to it that anyinformation given to us on this is gratefully acknowledged. Best DB

One can see how confused medical authors are about it, even as late as the commentators on Sarngadhara's Sarngadharasamhita (ca 1400). The Sanskrit name is a transparent borrowing from Greek.
