Dear members of the List,
I am trying to formulate with some Russian experts in cognitive sciences a joint project on the theories of perception. Does anybody know indologists or buddhologists who compared such modern concepts as "enactive" (F.Varela), or embodied cognition with Indian theoris of perception in a more or less systematical way? 
Thanking you in advance,
Victoria Lysenko
