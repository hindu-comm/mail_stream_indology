Subject: the 14th World Sanskrit Conference

Dear Colleagues,

The 14th World Sanskrit Conference will be held in Kyoto, Japan in
September 1-5, 2009. The organizers would like to inform that the
detailed information concerning the registration, accommodation, and
other practical matters is available at our revised web-site:

http://www.indology.bun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/14thWSC/

In addition to the web-version of the 2nd circular, the site contains
the on-line system of registration and payment of registration fee. We
request all the participants to make the on-line registration for the
sake of our manageability, even if you have already sent us your
registration form. We appreciate your cooperation.

I apologize for a possible double mailing, as some of you might have
received this document in another posting.

Conference Secretary
14th WSC

Akihiko Akamatsu
