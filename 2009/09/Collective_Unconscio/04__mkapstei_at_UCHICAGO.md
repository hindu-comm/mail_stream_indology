William Waldron's book on aalayavijñaana has some things to say about this 
and very fully documents earlier studies of this concept in yogaacaara 
Buddhism. 

If I recall correctly (it's been a really long time), Jeff Masson's not very well 
received book The Oceanic Feeling proposes some analogies.
