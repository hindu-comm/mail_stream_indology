Rajam,

If you want to research that thoroughly, you will find a wealth of material 
in the Pali Tipitaka, esp, the Vinaya and Nikayas. Women did preach, 
DhammadinnA being the most prominent (e.g., Majjhima NikAya 24). As for what 
they wore, daily activities, the vinaya is filled with rules and 
descriptions of that; there are more rules for nuns than for more monks.

Aside from working through the Vinaya yourself (which I recommend), see 
also:

Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, _A Comparative Study of BhikkhunI pATimokkha_ Varnasi 
and Delhi: Chaukhambha Orientalia, 1994.

_Women in the Footsteps of the Buddha: Struggle for Liberation in the 
Therigatha_ by Kathryn R. Blackstone. Motilal Banarsidass; 1st Indian ed 
edition (2000).

Others can provide additional reading.
