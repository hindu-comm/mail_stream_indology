I neglected to mention that this is from a translation I made together  
with V.S. Rajam quite a few years ago.  It is well accepted that the  
Bhaagavata was written by a Tamilian who knew the Tamil Srivaisnava  
tradition and texts.  From reading the 10th book many years ago and  
looking over these poems, it strikes me that the author was very  
likely familiar with the great poems of the ParipaaTal also.  George  
Hart
