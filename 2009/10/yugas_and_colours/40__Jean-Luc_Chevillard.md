Dear George,

I suppose this is a /lapsus calami/
and you meant "CE" (and not "BC").

Zvelebil, in his /Lexicon of Tamil Literature/ [1995:528], summarizing 
discussions on the date of Paripāṭal,
writes:

"Prob. date between latter half of 4th and first half of the 6th c."

Best wishes

-- Jean-Luc
