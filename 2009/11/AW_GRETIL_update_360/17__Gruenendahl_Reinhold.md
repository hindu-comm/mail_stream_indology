Dear Stephen,
I'm glad to hear the text came in time. No need to thank me. GRETIL is what
contributors make it.

Best wishes,
Reinhold Gr√ºnendahl

Dear Reinhold,

This latest addition of the Jnanalokalamkara-sutra to GRETIL you have just
announced is very timely.  I was just about to start inputting the text for
my own immediate use.  So many thanks for saving me the time and effort !

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
