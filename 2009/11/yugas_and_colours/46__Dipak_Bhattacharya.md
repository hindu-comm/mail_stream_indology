Thanks for the correction! I am extremely sorry for the inadvertent posting. I could consult Mitchiner's Introduction only this morning.
The origin of the idea .still, remains worth investigating. Referring to theMahabharata, i think, is still risky barring where it agrees with the later Vedic texts.The Vishnudharmottara may be better. It belongs to the extreme north, perhaps.Does the striking similarity betweenTrika and the views of the Siddhantins of the South speak of good connectivity?

But Mitchiner dates the Yuga Purana to the 1st century BCE, not the 5th 
century CE. Pingree dates it to the same century as Mitchiner, or 
possibly to the following one.

I checked the Yugapurāṇa (edMitchiner, AS,Calcutta1986 BI 312).but did not find any reference to the colour of the yugas. That means the absence of the idea in the North till the 5th Cent.CE (YP so dated/Mitchiner). The extant Bhāgavata could not have been redacted in the North. Its flowery classical kāvya style was a dead thing in the North during the time when it is supposed to have been redacted from a lost older Bhāgavata. The South can make a strong claim.

> "Black" is from kaari, ultimately from karu, the standard word for "black." "Dark" is maal, which can mean "blackness" or "greatness," "great man," "Visnu." "Dark one with green eyes" could also mean "Green-eyed Visnu!" -- which might make more sense, as "black" has already been used. The word for "green" can also mean "yellow."
