Dear Professor Thompson,
MS Word: paste; Arial Unicode MS; Insert; Symbol; will give you the svarita. Otherwise working outdidnot prove to be a problem. So one has ऋत्विज॑म् | Please confirm!

Dear List,

I went to this google transliteration site and started to type in the 
first lines of the Rigveda, and immedately I ran into problems. How does 
one generate something like Rtvijam?And how does one insert Vedic 
accent?

This thing seems no better than earlier transliteration programs as far 
as I can see.
