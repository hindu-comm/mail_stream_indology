Dear Members,

a student here at the University of Bologna has a keen interest in 
Indus civilization: not especially in the Indus script topic, but in 
Indus culture in the broadest sense and its relation with coeval 
cultures.
Since no institution in Italy gives prominence to this subject, he is 
willing to spend a period abroad (preferably, but not necessarily, in 
Europe).
Could anyone suggest me a place where the study of Indus civilization 
is actively carried out?

With best regards,

Marco Franceschini
