Dear All:

Since it appears now to be kosher to let everyone know about the 
publication on one's own book, here is my edition and translation of 
the Vaisnava Dharmasastra (aka Visnu-smriti) published in the Harvard 
Oriental Series (# 73).

The Law Code of Visnu. ISBN 9780674051393


Thanks.

Patrick Olivelle
