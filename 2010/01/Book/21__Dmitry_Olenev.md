Dear All:

Since it appears now to be kosher to let everyone know about the publication
on one's own book, here is my edition and translation of the Vaisnava
Dharmasastra (aka Visnu-smriti) published in the Harvard Oriental Series (#
73).

The Law Code of Visnu. ISBN 9780674051393


Thanks.

Patrick Olivelle
