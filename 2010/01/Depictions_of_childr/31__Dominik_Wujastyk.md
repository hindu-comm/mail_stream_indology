Dear Colleagues,

Can you point me to a scholarly discussion of this topic?  What are the
earliest depictions of children in S. Asian art?  What deductions can be
made about the idea of the child from any such images?  What I'm thinking
about is the S. A. evidence that might inform a discussion of the "invention
of childhood".

Best,
Dominik
