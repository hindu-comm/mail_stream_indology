I'm not aware that the INDOLOGY listserv software does anything at all to
emails.  It's just a reflector.  You refer to "filtered through the list",
but there's no filtering going on.  What the listserv receives, it bounces
directly out to the membership.  I would look at your local settings for the
cause of this blip.  Do you have a setting for making outgoing emails be in
"plain text" or some such name?  Try turning off any "rich formatting"
features.  Just a thought.

Best,
Dominik

> Dear List members,
> I am curious if anyone has suggestions for ensuring correct formating for
> messages to this list? I do not use an email program for my hotmail account
> and the lists I access through it, but send directly from my browser.
> Inevitably all the spacing is removed (or added in some cases) and I haven't
> been able to gain control over this. As in my last message about the

> my original message, became conflated into a single run-on paragraph when
> filtered through the list.
> Any suggestion for fixing this issue would be greatly appreciated!
> Best Wishes,BF
