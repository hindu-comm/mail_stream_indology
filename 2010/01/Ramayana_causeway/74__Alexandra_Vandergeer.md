Does anybody know of a relief or other work of art depicting the moment of the Ramayana causeway episode where the Fish Princess Pravarasena emerges or stands ashore? This particular moment seems to have been captured in Southeast Asia, but what about South Asia? Till now, I found only a Hoysala relief with Rama aiming his arrow at a fish 'above' (=in the distant) him, but whether this is the princess or stands for the fish as her people is unclear. A female figure stands to the right of Rama, maybe she is the princess, maybe not.
