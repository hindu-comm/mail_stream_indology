Dear List Members,
                             Are there any examples of Vedic rituals in
which the *barhis-* (or portion thereof) is to be strewn in a line, perhaps
along a North/South or East/West axis?
I'm searching (perhaps in vain) for possible parallels to a Zoroastrian
ritual in which one-third of the *baresman-* is required to be spread along
(or possibly against) the path of the sun.
Any suggestions would be most warmly received.
With thanks,
Leon Goldman (PhD candidate, SOAS).
