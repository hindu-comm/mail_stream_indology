Did Sanskrit ever have a 'dedicated' script in the North?Grantha belongs to the South. A few other dedicated scripts eg., Nadinagari,were developed in the Decaan. But none became popular in the nineteenth century. Oriya has ever beenas good for Oriya as for Sanskrit. So is Devnagari for Hindi and Sanskrit, Count Bengali, Telugu and Malayalam and Kannad too among others. And Gujarati, Newari, theBrahmi and post-Brahmi scriptand others I miss.Similar to Latin, French, English,post-Kemal Turkish and post-war German? A situation ripe for Lewis Carroll.
