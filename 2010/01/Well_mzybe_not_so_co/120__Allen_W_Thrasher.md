"The most detailed accounts of Ranjit Singh's (Sikh) rule predating the 
Dogras I am aware of are the voluminous contemporary travel reports by 
William Moorcroft, Johann Martin Honigberger, Baron von Huegel, and Godfrey 
Thomas Vigne. They are likely to provide useful information in this regard."

Thanks for the tip, Walter.
