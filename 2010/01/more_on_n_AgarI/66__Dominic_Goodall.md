Ah yes, I forgot to include this information.  The script of the early  
manuscript is what some today now call "Early Nepalese 'Licchavi'  
script". You can see an image of a couple of folios of a manuscript in  
a similar script, dated to 810 AD, in volume 1 of the Skandapurāṇa,  
just before the Prolegomena.

The Skandapurāṇa
Volume I Adhyāyas 1–25
Critically Edited with Prolegomena and English Synopsis by
R. Adraensen, H.T. Bakker, H. Isaacson
Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1998.
