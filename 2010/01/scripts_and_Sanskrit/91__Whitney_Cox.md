At the risk of being self-aggrandizing, I have a forthcoming article
on the (epigraphic) use of Nāgarī in the 11th and 12th century western
Deccan.  I would be happy to share off-prints with anyone interested
once it appears.  Please contact me off-list,

> "The Devanāgarī script plays in the Mahābhārata textual tradition the
> important rôle of being the commonest medium of the contamination of
> different Mahābhārata versions. A Devanāgarī manuscript of the Mahābhārata
> may, in fact, contain practically any version or combination of versions."

> Geographical location no doubt goes a long way to explain the dominance of
> Devanāgarī. Presumably centres such as Benares, a pilgrimage site and
> therefore a place at which many texts must have been copied by people from
> many regions, had a role to play.
>
> And long before Devanāgarī, there is evidence of the use, in certain
> contexts, of a North-Indian standard (a proto-Nāgarī) well beyond North
> Indian boundaries: digraphic inscriptions (using both a South Indian and a
> North Indian script type) are found on Pallava monuments of the early C8th,
> for instance, and somewhat later in Cambodia.
>
> One wonders, by the way, what centres (and what other factors) created the

> centuries.
>
> As for script-names, these are notoriously uncertain. Is it known when the
> Kashmirian script became known as Śāradā ? And is there any old name at all
> known for the South Indian script-type so very widely used in the 5th to 8th
> centuries ? South-East-Asianists today, of course, call it "Pallava
> Grantha"; but presumably this wasn't how it was known in C6th Karnataka or
> C6th Orissa or C6th Cambodia.
