I would be interested in having comments
on the Tamil form: வாரணாசி [vāraṇāci].

See the Tamil Lexicon (p. 3610)

வாரணாசி vāraṇāci, n. < Vāraṇasī. Benares, situate between the rivers 
Varaṇā and Asī; காசி. வாரணாசியோர் மறையோம்பாளன் (மணி. 13, 3).

See also another entry (p.3609), which gives a different spelling.

வாரணசி vāraṇaci, n. < vāraṇasī. See வாரணாசி. (யாழ். அக.)

The authority quoted by the Tamil Lexicon for the spelling vāraṇāci is 
the Maṇimēkalai
and comes from the chapter that tells the story of ஆபுததிரன்.
