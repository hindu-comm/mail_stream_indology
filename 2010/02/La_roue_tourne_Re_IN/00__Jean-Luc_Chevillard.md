Dear Herman,
Cher Herman,

thanks a lot for sharing your deeply felt experience with your students
(and especially with the student from Bengal)

Since the discussion has become
very "non-academic,"
please allow me to use my full linguistic capacity
(in French)
for adding some further comments
{{otherwise, we, native French citizen, would become second zone World 
citizens :-((   }}

merci de partager votre/ton expérience avec vos/tes étudiants.
[[By using the slash ["/"]sign, I am trying to overcome
one of the translation gaps between English and French :-) ]]

C'est très touchant!

"La roue tourne", sans jamais s'arrêter!

Qui peut savoir comment les propos que nous avons échangés ces derniers 
jours
seront interprétés plus tard,
par les archivistes du monde?

Peut-être que le souvenir d'enfance (à Khartoum)
que Dominik Wujastyk a partagé récemment
avec nous sera utilisé plus tard par un historien (a historical linguist)
pour prouver
que certains égyptiens ont entendu parler de "La Tamise"
avant d'entendre parler de "The Thames".

[[(I am referring to the comparison
/thaymees/ (like "rabies")]]

Comme l'a dit Blaise Pascal,
le monde est quelque chose
"dont le centre est partout et la circonférence nulle part".

There is nothing wrong with that !!

Cheers

-- Jean-Luc (Paris, France)
