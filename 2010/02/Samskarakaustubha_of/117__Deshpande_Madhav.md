Hello Indologists,

    Does anyone have a photocopy of Anantadeva's Samskarakaustubha and can make a copy for me?  This work was published in Pothi form in Mumbai in 1861.  Please contact me off-list (mmdesh at umich.edu).  Thanks.

Well, concerning the claim China has the first Sanskrit popsinger, America came first, indeed. There exists a music group called "Shanti Shanti" who is claimed to be the "first" Sanskrit rock band. See the homepage: <http://www.shantishanti.com/home.html>
