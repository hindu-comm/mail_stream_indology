Thanks, Dominik, for this information.  I downloaded the .tif files for this book from the DLI web-page.  They also have the other older edition of 1861.

Hi, Madhav.

The Digital Library of India has this entry:

 Sanskar Kaustubh Marathi Bhashantarasahit., 99999990103033. . 1980. marathi. . 167 pgs.

Likely to be of interest?
