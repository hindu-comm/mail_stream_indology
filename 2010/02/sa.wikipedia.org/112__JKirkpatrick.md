Please.....what are "sockpuppet" violations?

Even more interesting, if you get a history list of people who
edited those pages ranked by number of edits, almost all the top
ones are the VF people, and almost all of them have been banned
from using Wikipedia, mostly for "sockpuppet" violations.

Maybe we should give up the idea of our own FAQ, and just use
Wikipedia?

Has anyone else got ideas on why the INDOLOGY FAQ hasn't been
used?  Is it too fussy to get a password, perhaps?

Best,
Dominik
