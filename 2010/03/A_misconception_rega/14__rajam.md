Just wanted to make sure that we understand the principle behind the  
acronym PDF ( "Printable Document Format").

So, if we want to have a searchable PDF, we should ask the powers  
that are in the IT industry to develop something like an  
"SPDF" ("Searchable Printable Document Format").

Hope you can understand what I mean.

Best,
