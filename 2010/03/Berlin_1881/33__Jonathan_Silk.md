Friends,

I wonder if someone who has the proceedings of the Fifth International
Congress of Orientalists held in Berlin in 1881 on his or her bed-side table
(!) would be willing to look up something for me (it appears that while our
library has the volumes for the 4th and 6th, we don't have the 5th). Is
there  a list or index of attendees/participants? I know that the Japanese
scholar Bunyiu Nanjio (Bunyu Nanjo) attended, along with his teacher Max
MÃ¼ller. What I am interested to know is if Hendrik Kern was also there. I
think he must have been, but at least the bibliography I have does not list
a publication of his lecture (as it does for example for his contribution to
the 6th meeting of the same congress). I am trying to find out if the two,
Nanjo and Kern, might have met there. (Sadly, the correspondence files of
both respective scholars were destroyed, so I can't track any letters they
would have exchanged.)

With best thanks in advance, Jonathan
