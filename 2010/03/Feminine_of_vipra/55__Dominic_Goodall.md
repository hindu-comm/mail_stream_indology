It seems to occur in accounts of miscegenation, for example this one  
from the end of the Vaikhaanasag.rhyasuutra:

amba.s.thaad vipraayaa.m naavika.h, samudrapa.nyamatsyajiivii  
samudrala"nghanaa.m naava.m plaavayati.

etc.

Also Suprabhedaagama, kriyaapaada 2:60ab, this time with a different  
job-description:

amba.s.thasya tu vipraayaa.m jaato vaapakav.rttika.h|
