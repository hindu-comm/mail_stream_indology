Asunto: Bibliography of Indian Philosophy

Dear List Members,

Please excuse cross postings. I have been asked by Oxford University Press
to compile an online bibliography of Indian Philosophy to be part of their
Oxford Bibliogrpahy Online project. It is not supposed to be long: max 7500
words. It will include entries on: 


. Classical darsanas (including selected tranlsations),
. Textbooks,
. Anthologies, 
. Secondary works that focus on specific darsanas (Nyaya, Vaisesika,
Jainism, Vedanta etc.,). 


If any one would like to make literature suggestions to me for any of these
sections, please do so off list. I am very happy to hear from authors who
would like me to include their work. If you are a self promoter, please do
not feel shy. I cannot guarantee that I can include every suggestion sent to
me, but I would be greatful for any and all suggestions. Also if you have
any strong opinions about how such a bibliography should be organized, I
would love to hear from you.

I am particularly interested in finding out about new secondary material and
anthologies. 

Best wishes,
Shyam
