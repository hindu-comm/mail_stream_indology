> I hope all is well with you; and, once again, thanks for your hospitality

> your offer of more hospitality, due to lack of time.

> When we met there you mentioned that you might be able to provide me with 
> some sort of copy (hard or PDF) of your Raghuvamsa book which, shockingly, 
> we don't have in our library here. As I intend to use it for a kavya 
> course next quarter, it would be great to have one, if it's still 
> available.

> Thanks again,
