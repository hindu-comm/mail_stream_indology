I was sent this email and it's outside my area of focus by 1-2000 years so I thought I'd pass on the request. Of course, the questioner seems to have some misunderstandings about the nature of the Vedanta-Buddhist dialog over the centuries but I'm sure y'all or your sources will deal with that.
Best,
Dean
