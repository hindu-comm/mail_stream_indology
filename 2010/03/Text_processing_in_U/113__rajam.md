This may also happen based on the specific operating system. I use an  
old OS X (10.4)-based Mac PowerBook G4.

I copied a small paragraph and have pasted it below. It seems to have  
turned out fine (except for a couple of minor glitches -- with  
respect to the letters r and ai). The latest OS may have resolved  
this problem:

==================

As for searching, the typing into the search field may pose a  
problem, since the keyboard may be different and the ASCII values are  
not properly read-in. The best way is to copy an instance of the  
desired item and paste it into the search field and hit the Enter/ 
Return key as we go along.

Best,
