Dear All,

first thanks to all who helped me with the upodghātaḥ verse.

I am now in search of a Sanskrit parallel for the verse  from the  
Vajirabuddhiṭīkā cited below, or for a list of the five terms  
saññā nimittaṃ kattā parimāṇaṃ payojanaṃ. The only source  
for these five terms up to now is Candrakīrti (see Steinkellner,  
"Remarks on Tantristic Hermeneutics", Csoma de Körös Memorial  
Symposium, 1978), where they come under the first of the seven  
alaṅkāras, i.e. upodghataḥ, which form a group of exegetical  
tools used in interpreting Tantras.

verse from Vjb 1,17-18

saññā nimittaṃ kattā ca parimāṇaṃ payojanaṃ
sabbāgamassa pubbeva vattabbaṃ vattuṃ icchatā ti

the meaning of the terms in Vjb is as follows:

saññā = name of the text
nimittaṃ = motive for writing the text
kattā = author
parimāṇaṃ = extent, length of the text
payojanaṃ =  purpose of the text


According to a v.l. in Vjb this verse is said for every Tantra  
(pavuttā sabbatantānaṃ)

Every hint is welcome,
Petra
