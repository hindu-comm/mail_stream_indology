Hello,

Vamana has something to say about the word in his Kavyalamkarasutra with a
Paninian citation, but I'm not sure if its exactly what you are looking
for.   This is the text from GRETIL:


*trivalīśabdaḥ siddhaḥ saṃjñā cet // VKal_5,2.14 [*VKal_5,2.13] //*

trivalīśabdaḥ siddho yadi saṃjñā / *diksakhye sa.ñjñāyām*(Pā_2,1.50) iti
saṃjñāyāmeva samāsavidhānāt //14//




All the Best,
Victor
