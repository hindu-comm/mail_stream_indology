Dear Indologists,
The Sanskrit words,both Vali and Trivali are synonymous.It endsin short /i/.According to the Amarakoșa ,valih̦ prān̦yan·gaje striyām.Vali means the three lines in shrunk stomach.Here a gan̦asūtra(No.49)on 4.1.45 itah̦ prān·yan.gāt applies.n·īs. suffix is prescribed after a Prātipadika meaning an organ of a living being and ending in short /i/.Consequently vali + n·iș = valī.The same view has been expressed in the Nyāsa and Padamañjarī too.
Thanks,

Dear List Members,

Can anyone help finding a reference in Paninian literature for the
lengthening of the final vowel of trivali to trivalI in compounds?

MW says "f. in comp. the 3 folds over a woman's navel (regarded as a beauty)
VarBṛS. lxx , 5 Ṛitus. GarP."

I have looked in P. 6.3.114-139, which appears to be the relevant section,
but may have missed something.

With thanks,
Oliver
