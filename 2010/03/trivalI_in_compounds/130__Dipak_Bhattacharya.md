After Jayāditya’s explanation of P.2.1.51 taddhitārthottarapadasamāhāre ca when, of a compoundformed after 2.1.50 the final meaning is that of a taddhita suffix or when a third word (uttarapada) follows the compound or when an ensemble is meant one gets a tatpuruṣa compound. This uttarapada compound is different from the uttarapadalopin compound commonly illustrated with siṃhāsana ‘lion (marked) seat ie a throne’. Naturally trilokanātha (Kumārasambhava 5.77) has been explained by Mallinātha as an uttarapada compound. This is implied also in the explanation of trilokasaundarya (5.41).
trivalī is neither an uttarapadalopin nor an uttarapada compound. An ensemble is meant. Naturally 2.1.50 and 51 are sufficient for forming the compound without invoking the concept of uttarapadalopin. The gaṇasūtra 50 appended to 4.1.45 takes care of the long ī of words like trivalī.

Dear List Members,

Can anyone help finding a reference in Paninian literature for the
lengthening of the final vowel of trivali to trivalI in compounds?

MW says "f. in comp. the 3 folds over a woman's navel (regarded as a beauty)
VarBṛS. lxx , 5 Ṛitus. GarP."

I have looked in P. 6.3.114-139, which appears to be the relevant section,
but may have missed something.

With thanks,
Oliver
