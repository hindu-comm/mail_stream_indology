A quick Google search brought up this verse, from the beginning of folio 2a in Tisaṭa's Cikitsākalikā with commentary, in number 947 (Chambers 711) on page 293 of Verzeichniss der Sanskrit-Handschriften, volume 1 of Die Handschriften-Verzeichnisse der Koeniglichen Bibliothek (Berlin, 1853).  The book is available on Googlebooks. 

upo]dghātaḥ padaṃ caiva padārthaḥ padavigrahaḥ vāsanāpratavasthaānaṃ vyākhyā tantrasya ṣaḍvidhā

Cikitsākalikā has been published together with a commentary by his son Candraṭa, but I do not have volume in my personal library. The verse, which evidently is cited in Candraṭa's commentary, does not appear in the excerpts from the commentary in Julius Jolly, Zur Quellenkunde der Indischen Medezin 4..., ZDMG 60:413-468.

Words like upogghāta, pratyavajjāna, vyākhyā used in this verse make it probable that Vajirabuddhi based himself on some Sanskrit source.
