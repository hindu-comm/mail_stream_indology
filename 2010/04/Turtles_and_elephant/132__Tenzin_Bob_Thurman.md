There's a famous golden turtle in Tibetan astrology and divination. 
Manjushri out of his concern for the Chinese, who are interested in 
time, astronomy, and divination, emanates himself as a golden turtle, 
then slays hisemanates turtle self and his shell comes up with the eight 
trigrams [same as those of the I Ching] for divination, and perhaps 
other geometrical patterns. In the same series of actions, he creates 
his earthly pure land at Wu Tai Shan in Shansi province
