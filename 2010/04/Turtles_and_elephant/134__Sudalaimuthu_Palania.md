I have a few somewhat related questions. Does the myth of the tortoise/turtle supporting the world have anything to do with the hibernating behavior of the tortoise? Is that why in Agnicayana a tortoise is buried under the altar? For two Indology posts related to this issue, see:

But then not all species of turtles/tortoise hibernate. I do not know if there are any tortoises/turtles in north India that hibernate. If not, could the myth have originated outside India where tortoises are known to hibernate?

Regards,
Palaniappan

Pitalkhora and Karle in the western caves have elephant plinths, and the Maha-stupa at Anuradhapura has a spectacular one all around it. In all cases the elephants face the viewer and support the structure on their backs.

From the existence of these I would suggest that elephants were an early (as early as we have sculpture of them) marker of the division between the mundane and the attained worlds.
