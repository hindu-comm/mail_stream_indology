Steven Collins' Nirvāṇa and Other Buddhist Felicities (Cambridge 1998)
is a sustained reflection on the idea of utopia in the Theravada

There is a Wiki article "Uttarakuru" with inadequate source citations (and multiple misspellings) but which at least directs one to the names of the texts mentioning them, and a few chapter and verse citations. Standard books on ancient cosmology and geography would presumably mention them and give sources better. So would dictionaries and perhaps books on ancient Indian political thought.
