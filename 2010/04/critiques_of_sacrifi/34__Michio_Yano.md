One of the interesting sources is the Buddhist
text ZaarduulakarNaavadaana (ed. by 
Mukhopadhyaya, Santiniketan 1954, page 19),
where Brahmanical sacrifice is critisized as
being performed by those who want to eat the
meat of sacrificail animals.

lines 15-18:

braahmaNai raudracittais tu paryaayo hy eSa cintitaH/
maaMsaM khaaditukaamais tu prokSaNaM kalpitaM pazoH//
