Hi Axel c.s.,

Please look at M. Sparreboom, Chariots in the Veda, Leiden: Brill, 1985,
especially pp. 89-90 and the indices. You will find a lot of references
and discussion, and other publications quoted or mentioned.

good luck and don't fall off your horse without or even with them,

Frits

> Does anybody know the Sanskrit or any Prakrit term for "stirrup" (the
