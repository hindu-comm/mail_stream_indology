I've just switched the list's default behaviour to "Reply to Sender" rather
than "Reply to List".  Let's see how we like it.

In the 20-year history of this INDOLOGY list, this topic has of course come
up before.  In the past, the consensus has been that "reply to list" is a
greater convenience, and "reply to sender" is not what most people want for
most postings.

Anyhow, let's see.  Times change.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
