For a while now I've been keeping a list of about 180 periodicals with
material on Classical Indian and Buddhist Studies:

 Indica et Buddhica - Tabulae
 Tabulae: Tables of Contents for Indology and Buddhology
 http://tabulae.indica-et-buddhica.org/

Here is the site map:

 Tabulae - Site Map

A few links to material on the Journal Asiatique can be found here:

 Tabulae - Journal Asiatique
 http://tabulae.indica-et-buddhica.org/periodica/j/journal-asiatique



Kind regards,

 Richard


P.S. This listing is incomplete so if anyone knows of material that
isn't included please feel free to suggest it and I put up additonal
pages. This form may be helpful:
