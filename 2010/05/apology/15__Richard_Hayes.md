I started using e-mail so long ago that new users were then given courses by the IT department at my University on how to use this new tchnology. One piece of advice has always stuck with me (even though I have occasionally failed to observe it): "Never say anything in an e-mail that you would not wish to appear on the front page of the NY Times."

I strongly second Professor Lindquist's strong urging. Of the many lists I receive, this Indology list results in by far the most red-faced apologies for messages sent here by mistake. (By the way, Steven, are we still on for lunch today?)
