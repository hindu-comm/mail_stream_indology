Patrick,

Actually, Boehtlingk and Roth says "2) Elle, das Maass vom Ellbogen bis zur Spitze des kleinen Fingers", the shorter Boehtlingk says "2) Elle, die Entfernung vom Ellbogen bis zur Spitze des kleinen Fingers, = 2 Prādeśa oder 24 Aṅgula", and Monier-Williams follows this in his definition "a cubit of the middle length, from the elbow to the tip of the little finger". These agree with Apte and Basham. The problem is that the usual term for this measure in English is cubit, while in English the 45 inch measure is an ell. In German , Elle may mean cubit, or ell (if the dictionary I consulted may be trusted).

> Friends: here is a question. I am trying to get the measurement of the Sanskrit aratni. Both M-W and Bohtlingk gives the old measurement "ell" -- which is said to be 45 inches (1.14 meters). This surely cannot be if the measurement is from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Apte gives the measurement as 24 angulas (i.e., about 47 cms.). The latter is also the measurement given by Basham in his Wonder.
