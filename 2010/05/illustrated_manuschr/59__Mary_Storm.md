Dear Indologists,

Greetings from Delhi, where it is hot enough to melt a brass door knob.

Benoytosh Bhattacharyya in The Indian Buddhist Iconography, second ed. 1958, refers to the existence of illustrated manuscripts of the Bodhicaryāvatāra (p. 5). Has anyone on this list seen such a text, and if so, do you know where it might be or where a copy might exist?

Thanks so much!
Mary
