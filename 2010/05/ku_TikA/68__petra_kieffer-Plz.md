Dear All,

in an old commentary (from a Buddhist context) of about the first  
century AD, and probably of South Indian origin, i.e. in the  
Andhakaṭṭhakathā, I have the statement that after burning a  
corpse a hut (kuṭikā) is erected (karīyati) for the ashes and the  
bones.

Does anybody know whether this is some general habit or perhaps a  
local custom or perhaps restricted to a specific time.

Any suggestions are welcome,
Petra
