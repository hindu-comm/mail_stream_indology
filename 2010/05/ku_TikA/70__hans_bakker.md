In some Gandharan reliefs discussed in:  de Marco, G. (1987). T/he Stupa 
as a funerary monument. New iconographical evidence./ East and West,
37, 191–246,  funerary monuments are depicted that are described as  ` 
hut.'  (p. 232).  The matter is discussed again in my
/Monuments to the Dead in Ancient North India  /in Indo-Iranian Journal  
(2007) 50: 11–47, especially pp. 29f.
