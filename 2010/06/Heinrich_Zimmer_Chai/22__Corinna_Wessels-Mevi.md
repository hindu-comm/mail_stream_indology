Dear All,

Many of you would be aware of this already - I wasn't
until I found a note in Wikipedia (German WIKI, "Heinrich Zimmer", Indologist) just
five minutes ago. The event is so important that I thought of making it
known to others. Watching it via livestream is a wonderful opportunity
at least. Here is the shortened url of the information page:
