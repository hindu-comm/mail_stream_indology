Thanks Dr. Pant! But if it is राल and राड़ in the inscriptions, should not राढ़ be excluded? I cannot tell about the source, but sometime I saw a similar problem rising with लाटदेश from where Vijayasimha is said to have come to Sri Lanka.
Best wishes for all

Dear Professor Bhattacharya

Your transliteration intoNagari is correct, though a minor correction in the second line is necessary: kaDaaDa is to bechanged into karaaDa.

Regards.
