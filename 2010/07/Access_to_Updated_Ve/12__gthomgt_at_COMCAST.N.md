Dear List, 



My latest computer crash has cost me access to a a few valuable resources, which I had thought would be easily available online, so I didn't make backups of them. 



One of these is the updated version of Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance [which I own in its book version]. This updated version was done by Marco Franceschini in 2005. In my google searchesfor this I get only pages that say that this documentis no longer freely accessible. 



Is this correct? 



Thanks for any help. 



George Thompson
