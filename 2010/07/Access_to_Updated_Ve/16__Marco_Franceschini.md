Dear list members,

a new Vedic Concordance has been published in 2007 in the HOS series 
(no. 66), two volumes and CD (Unicode compliant files also). With 
respect to the 2005 version, the HOS one had been enhanced by the 
inclusion of some 11,000 mantras taken from Baudhayana Srautasutra.

Anyhow, you can download the old, free 2005 version at:

Please note that all the files are now Unicode compliant: they work 
both on Mac and Windows machines and there's no need to install 
special fonts any more.

Best wishes,

Marco Franceschini
