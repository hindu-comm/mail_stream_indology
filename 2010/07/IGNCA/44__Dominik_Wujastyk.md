This is a situation where answering to the group would be better than
(auto-)answer to me personally, because I've had almost as many different
answers as kind respondents.


   1. Dr. Dipti S. Tripathi (Director of NAMAMI last March)
   2. Dipti Tripathy one of the professor of Sanskrit from Delhi University
   is the successor of Dr. Gayacharan Tripathy.
   3. Shri Chinmaya R. Gharekhan.
   4. Dr.Jyotindra Jain.

My understanding, from 2009 was that the director of NAMAMI was  Dr. Vijay
Shankar Shukla.  Has he *already* been replaced by Dr Tripathi?

Aha: the NAMAMI website <http://www.namami.org/Missiondirectory.htm> is a
bit more transparent than the IGNCA one: Tripathi is Director, Shukla is
senior research officer.

So, NAMAMI is clear.  What about IGNCA.

Answers on a postcard, please, to INDOLOGY at liverpool.ac.uk
First prize for the lucky winner will be universal admiration.
