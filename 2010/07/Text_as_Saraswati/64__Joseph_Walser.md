I have noticed that at least among Tamil Brahmins, if someone touches a 
book with his or her feet, she quickly touches the book and touches her 
eyes. The explanation I have heard is that this is to apologize to 
Saraswati who resides in the print. Can anyone tell me how widespread 
this practice is? Does anyone know of any early references to or 
scholarly discussion of this practice?
Best,

Joseph
