The pot is a god.  The winnowing
fan is a god.  The stone in the
street is a god.  The comb is a
god.  The bowstring is also a
god.  The bushel is a god and the
spouted cup is a god.

Gods, gods, there are so many
there's no place left
for a foot.

        There is only
one god.  He is our Lord
of the Meeting Rivers.

The explanation I have heard is that this is to apologize to Saraswati who resides in the print. Can anyone tell me how widespread this practice is? Does anyone know of any early references to or scholarly discussion of this practice?
