Dear Stella,

This is news to me! I've never seen a gold toe ring in my old  
environments! It shows how disparate things can be in India at a  
given time in similar social ethnic backgrounds!

Thanks for the information, and I will check it with my living  
"antique" family members! :)

Regards,
Rajam
