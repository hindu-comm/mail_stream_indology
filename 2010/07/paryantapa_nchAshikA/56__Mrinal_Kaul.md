Dear Friends,

I would highly appreciate if someone could let me have any information regarding the Mss of the above mentioned text in any of the Ms libraries around the world. After a very exhaustive search I have only been able to find a single palm-leaf Ms in Malayalam script in Trivendrum. This Ms was also used by Dr. V. Raghavan for his edition of the Paryantapañcāśikā (1951). I would highly appreciate any information about this. Thank you very much in advance.

Yours sincerely,

Mrinal Kaul
