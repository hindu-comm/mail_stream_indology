Friends~



The idea that ananda or bliss is not individual but universal is deep in the Indian tradition.



The Buddhists draw on this in their concept of nirvana.



The shanti path which says "sarve skhina bhavatu etc" does enunciate this concept. 



Is there any other sutra that defines ananda as being universal?



Regards.



Harsha.
