Hi all,
I have updated the modules for Hindi and Marathi. Since the previous
release a few small bugs were found and fixed. Marathi rules now exist
also in transliteration and a module with merge rules for nuktas was
developed. Documentation was updated, the transliteration script is
documented via POD. Feedback still required, mainly from a Marathi
native speaker. Addition of Nepali support requires help of a Nepali
native speaker.

In order to be compatible with xindy it was decided to license the
package under GLP V2+.

The URL of the package is http://icebearsoft.euweb.cz/xindy-devanagari/
