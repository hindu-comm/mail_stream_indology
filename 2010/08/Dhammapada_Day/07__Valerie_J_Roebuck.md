Dear Colleagues

This is to let you know that the Centre for the History of Religion in Asia, Cardiff University, is hosting a Dhammapada Day on 14 September, as a launch event for my new translation. If you would like a programme, please contact me off-list.

The book is to be published on 26 August: it's on the Penguin website at <http://www.penguinclassics.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140449419,00.html?The_Dhammapada_Anonymous>
