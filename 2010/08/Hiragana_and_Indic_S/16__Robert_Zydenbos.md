Apart from what Dan Lusthaus has already mentioned about the  
established view on the origination of the kana scripts, one should  
note that Siddham is very 'Indian' in its structure: like all the  
Brahmi-derived scripts, Siddham is of the script type known as  
'abugida' (in which a basic syllabic sign is modified by means of  
secondary vowel signs to indicate that the vowel of the syllable is  
not 'a'), and the kana scripts are fundamentally different.
