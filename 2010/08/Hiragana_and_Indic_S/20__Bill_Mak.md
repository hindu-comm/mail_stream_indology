Dear Peter,

The most authoritative work on the subject is Mabuchi Kazuo日本韻学史の研究 / 馬渕和夫
(1962)'s Nihon Ingakushi no kenkyuu 日本韻学史の研究. The three-volumed masterpiece
contains numerous references to the questions you raised together with a
bewildering mass of materials that worths a lifetime's study.

Materials in English on this subject are largely preliminary both in scope
and depth, starting with Van Gulik, followed by Chauduri as others had
mentioned.

Best regards,
Bill Mak
