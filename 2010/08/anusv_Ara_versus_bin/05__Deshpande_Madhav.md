Dear Indologists,

     I recite the Gaṇeśaa Atharvaśīrṣa everyday since my childhood, but I had not previously thought about some of the lines in it:  gakāraḥ pūrvarūpam / akāro madhyamarūpam / anusvāraś cāntyarūpam / bindur uttararūpam / nādaḥ sandhānam / saṃhitā sandhiḥ /.  While the anusvāra is considered to be antya, the bindu is considered to be uttara.  Is there any (tāntric?) explanation to split the anusvāra and the bindu.  I always thought that bindu is simply a graphic representation for the anusvāra, as is seen in some grammars of Skt:  upariṣṭād bindur anusvāraḥ.  How would one distinguish antya from uttara in these lines?  Any suggestions?
