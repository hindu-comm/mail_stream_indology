Prayers vary from region to region. Still, the setting makes it appear that the first three sentences pertain to the mātr̥kā but after that, from anusvāra, the prayer pertains to the process ie the significance of anusvāra etc. If this is correct bindu is the thing and not the written representaion. In Ṥāktāgama bindu is the neuter unconscious element of the triratna.

Dear Indologists,

 I recite the Gaṇeśaa Atharvaśīrṣa everyday since my childhood, but I had not previously thought about some of the lines in it: gakāraḥ pūrvarūpam / akāro madhyamarūpam / anusvāraś cāntyarūpam / bindur uttararūpam / nādaḥ sandhānam / saṃhitā sandhiḥ /. While the anusvāra is considered to be antya, the bindu is considered to be uttara. Is there any (tāntric?) explanation to split the anusvāra and the bindu. I always thought that bindu is simply a graphic representation for the anusvāra, as is seen in some grammars of Skt: upariṣṭād bindur anusvāraḥ. How would one distinguish antya from uttara in these lines? Any suggestions?
