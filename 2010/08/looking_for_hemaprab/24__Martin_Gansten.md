I have been trying for some time, so far unsuccessfully, to procure a 
copy (printed, photocopied or scanned) of the Trailokyaprakāśa by 
Hemaprabha Sūri. Apart from the edition mentioned by Pingree (New Delhi 
1967), I am aware only of a 1980 edition (with Hindi translation) 
published by the Jamnagar Jain Sangh.

Even more elusive is the Tājikatantrasāra (aka Gaṇakabhūṣaṇa, aka 
Karmaprakāśikā, aka Mānuṣyajātaka) by Samarasiṃha. Here I know of only 
one edition (with Nīlakaṇṭha's Tājikanīlakaṇṭhī, Meraṭha 1866).

Any help with locating either of these texts would be greatly appreciated.
