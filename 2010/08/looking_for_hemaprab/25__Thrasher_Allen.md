It also can be requested via Interlibrary Loan.  Or one can just buy the fiche from our Duplication Services < http://www.loc.gov/preserv/pds/ >.  The latter might be quicker and no more expensive.  There is also a copy in the Bibliotheque Nationale, according to WorldCat.  I have no idea if these are the same work attibuted to different authors.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Looking for Hemaprabha Sūri's Trailokyaprakāś a (etc.)

I have been trying for some time, so far unsuccessfully, to procure a copy (printed, photocopied or scanned) of the Trailokyaprakāśa by Hemaprabha Sūri. Apart from the edition mentioned by Pingree (New Delhi 1967), I am aware only of a 1980 edition (with Hindi translation) published by the Jamnagar Jain Sangh.

Even more elusive is the Tājikatantrasāra (aka Gaṇakabhūṣaṇa, aka Karmaprakāśikā, aka Mānuṣyajātaka) by Samarasiṃha. Here I know of only one edition (with Nīlakaṇṭha's Tājikanīlakaṇṭhī, Meraṭha 1866).

Any help with locating either of these texts would be greatly appreciated.
