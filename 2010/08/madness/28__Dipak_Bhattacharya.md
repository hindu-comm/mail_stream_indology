I think AAyurveda is not meant. It extensively deals with madness .

Dear List,

Does anyone know if the diagnosis & treatment of madness/ mental illness is
prescribed in the dharmaśāstra corpus?

I am interested in any *legal* definition and its application which may be
separate from any mention in the Ayurvedic aṅgas of bhūta vidya and
manovijñān.

Thanks,
