Discussion proposal: an accessable standardized, comprehensive and searchable corpus of Sanskrit 
texts is urgently needed like the humanists/greek scholars have it for example (indeed they have 
some for running software over etc.). Forces have to be bundled. I think that SARIT is the most 
promising approach so far.

Greetings,
