Dear List, 

My access to JSTOR currently isn't working. I would like to download an article by Keith which appears to deal with the development of Vedic Shakhas. I am interested in particular in the development of the Mandukeyas, for a festschrift paper that I am trying to write, with a deadline hanging over my head. 

Does anyone have a pdf of this article, or can anyone easily & readily get it [without much trouble!]? I would of course be most grateful for your help. 

And if anyone else has any insights into the obscure origins of the Mandukeyas, I would like to hear about them. 

Best wishes to all, 

George Thompson
