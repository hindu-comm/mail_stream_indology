Hi Jonathan,

I've found it best to consider it as a collation,
rather than a critical edition. It is useful
primarily in that it records - fairly well in my
experience - the variants in the different editions
it uses. But if one were preparing a critical edition,
one might wish to cross-check.

as ever,
Matthew
