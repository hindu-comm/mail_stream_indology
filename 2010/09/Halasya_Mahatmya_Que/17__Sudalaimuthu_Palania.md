In his article, "The "Periya Puraṇam" Frieze at Tārācuram: Episodes in the Lives of the Tamil Śaiva Saints",  Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 42, No. 2, In Honour of Thomas Burrow (1979), pp. 268-289, J. R. Marr says on p.281, "He made a number of royal journeys on pilgrimage, and in Maturai met the musician Pattiraṉār, referredto both in P[eriyapurāṇam] and Tiruvilai[yāṭal Purāṇam] as Pāṇanār Pattiraṉār. This does not stop Āṟumuka nāvalar, C. K. Cuppiramaṇiya Mutaliyār and Veṅkaṭacāmi Nāṭṭār referring to this devotee as Pāṇapattirar, perhaps based on Skt. Bāṇabhadra.

I would appreciate if anybody with access to Sanskrit Hālāsya Māhātmya could check if the name Bāṇabhadra occurs in the episode dealing with Śiva selling firewood in Madurai and give the reference.

Thanks in advance
