Dear scholars,

Might someone have a digital copy of the Malayalam text on viṣavaidya called Jyotsnikā they would be willing to share off-list?  It is quite rare and I am unable to get it by interlibrary loan or online.  If someone on the list has a paper copy of an edition, or even a manuscript, I would be happy to pay for a reproduction of it. 

Thank you,

Michael Slouber
