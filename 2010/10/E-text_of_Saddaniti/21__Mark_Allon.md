Dear Madhav,

This was recently brought to my attention on another list (Pali Study
list):

Vol. 1:     http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/2699.pdf
Vol. 2:     http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/2700.pdf
Vol. 3:     http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/2701.pdf
Vol. 4:     http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/2702.pdf
Vol. 5: 	http://asi.nic.in/asi_books/2665.pdf

It appears that Vol. 5: parts 1 and 2 (index of Pali words) are missing.



Regards
Mark
