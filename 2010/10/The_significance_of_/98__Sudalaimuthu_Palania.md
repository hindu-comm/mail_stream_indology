Dear Scholars,




There are Classical Tamil poets whose names contain the component 'mOci' and there have been questions about the significance of 'mOci' and the social status of poets like mOci kIran2Ar. The following text in inscription ARE 97/1927-28 in Tiruppukalur shows that most probably mOci was a gotra name and mOci kIran2Ar was a brahmin.
