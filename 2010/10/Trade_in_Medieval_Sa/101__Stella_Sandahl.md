Dear Patrick,
This is a bit on the side, but there's an article by V.S. Agrawala  
about a ritual at a well preceding sea voyages for trading purposes in
Agrawala, V.S.: “The Seven-Sea Gift in the Matsya Purana” in    
Purana . Bulletin of the Purana Department. All India Kashiraja  
Trust,Vol. 1, No. 2 Feb. 1960, pp. 206-212.
Best
Stella
