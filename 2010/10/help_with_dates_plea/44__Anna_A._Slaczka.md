Yes, these are bhUtasaMkhyAs.
I would suggest searching in the Monier-Williams first. Many bhUtasaMkhyAs are listed there. Then look at glossaries of editions of some zilpazAstras and Agamas where the bhUtasaMkhyAs occur very frequently. See for example the Mayamata edition by Dagens and the publications of the French Institute of Indology in Pondicherry.
