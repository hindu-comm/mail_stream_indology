Dear Colleague,

An excellent student of Sanskrit, Mr Aung Than of Sydney, has asked for some help with dates:

"I would like to ask you some questions if you can help me. Some time we can find some writing for year or date as below, where can I find the information about the numbers used in the word form.

sindhu bindu veda candra shAka
bAna bAna veda candra shAka
mahi sindhu bhuta indu shAka
shAka = shakabdA (shAka era)
I could guess sindhu (sapta sindhu) = 7, bindu (dot) = 0, veda (catur veda) = 4, bhuta (panca bhuta) = 5,
indu = candra = ?
bAna = ?
mahi = ?"

Is there some kind person out there who can help out?

Yours

McComas
