Dear list,
I would be thankful for any bibliographical hints on the position of the study of "pa~ncavidyaa's" in the Buddhist monasteries in India and (!) Tibet. So far I could only find some passing references to this matter here and there. Would be grateful for any pointer to a systematic study (or a treatise among  primary sources)

Best, 
Andrey Klebanov
