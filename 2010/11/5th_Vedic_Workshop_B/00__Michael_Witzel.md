Dear List Members,



The Centre for Eurasiatic and Afroasiatic Studies (CEAS), Bucharest,

has the pleasure to invite you to the fifth International Vedic Workshop

to be organized on September 20th- 23rd 2011 in Bucharest, Romania.



Suggested topics include:

–      The formation of the Vedic canon: from family books to Vedic  
śākhās, from Traividya to Caturveda;

–      Vedic schools and Vedic “dialects”: śākhās and  
prātiśākhyas;

–      The relation between śākhās and caraṇas of the same or  
different Vedas (Rg, Sāma, Yajur, Atharva): borrowing, citation,  
supplementation, usurpation (YV hautra);

–      Vedic śākhās and caraṇas in the performance of Vedic  
ritual: compatibility, incompatibility, competition and cooperation;

–      Sources for the localization and history of the śākhās and  
their promoters (inscriptions, manuscript colophons, literary  
sources, etc.);

–      Self-reflexivity of the Vedic tradition and its śākhās:  
anukramaṇīs, the (Yajur) vedavrkṣa;

–      A recourse to svaśākhā: the medieval and modern prayogas  
and paddhatis.



Speakers will be invited on the basis of submitted abstracts of  
proposed contributions (before 30 January 2011).

Prof. Dr. Shrikant Bahulkar
