Friends~

Is it right to say that when one uses the word 'Deccan', particualry when one is talking about the arts, that it applies to the 5 kingdoms that sprang up after the collapse of the Vijaynagar Empire?

One does not use the word 'Deccan' when one is talking about the Cholas and the Nayakas and the Chalukyas.

Is this correct?

Regards.
