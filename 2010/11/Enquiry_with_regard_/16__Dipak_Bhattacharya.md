The Aalankaarikas beginningwith Bharata speak of the individual colours pertaining to particular rasas. Another source will be the dhyaanas of deities in the Tantric manuals.

Dear Colleagues,

An undergraduate student recently asked me about colour symbolism in Hindu Traditions.

I realised very quickly that I knew very little about this.

Can anyone suggest readings (primary and secondary) on this topic?

With Thanks and Best Wishes,
