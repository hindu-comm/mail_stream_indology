I highly recommend the study
Damais, Louis-Charles: Études javanaises. III. A propos des couleurs symboliques des points cardinaux. In:  Bulletin de l'Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient. Tome 56, 1969. pp. 75-118.

[I myself have a problem downloading articles from this site recently, and got a blank file when I tried this one a few months ago; hopefully that problem is resolved now; in any case, the article can be consulted and searched online.]
It is presented as an 'étude javanaise', but in fact contains many properly indological data, and in any case, the Javanese tradition is equally a Hindu Tradition.
