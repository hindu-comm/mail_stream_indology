I haven't had the chance to go back and check, 
but I believe that interesting issues of
colour symbolism may also be found in
some works on tantric yoga such as the
.sa.tcakranirupa.nam, as well as 
musical works of the raagamaala type.
(On the latter, Klaus Ebeling's 1973 study
might be a good place to start, on the former, there's
of course "Arthur Avalon's" The Serpent Power, but
also a more recent French translation and study
by Tara Michael.)
