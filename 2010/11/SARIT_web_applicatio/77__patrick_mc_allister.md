Dear Richard,

the site's technical parts are currently being maintained by me. For
more general matters (adding texts to be searched, etc.), Dominik
Wujastyk should be contacted.

It would be very helpful if you could send me a list of things that
broke or changed since the `upgrade'. Actually, anyone with such
observations should please write to either Dominik or me.

Thanks in advance,
