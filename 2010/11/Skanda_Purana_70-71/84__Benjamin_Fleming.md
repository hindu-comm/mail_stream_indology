Dear All,
I have quickly received a copy of the text; no need for further help on this!

> Does anyone have a copy of Kṛṣṇaprasāda Bhaṭṭarāī's edition of the early Skanda Purāṇa, chapters 70-71, that they might be willing to scan for me? My copy of this text appears to be missing these chapters for some reason. Chapter 71 deals with the myth of Śarabha and Narasimha, I believe. I am missing from 70.59 to the end of chapter 71. I would be grateful if anyone could provide this for me off-list.
