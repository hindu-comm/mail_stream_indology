As for Buddhist:

@article{funayama:prayojana,
  author =	 {Toru Funayama},
  title =	 {{A}rca\d{t}a, \'{S}\=antarak\d{s}ita,
                  {J}inendrabuddhi, and {K}amala\'s\={\i}la on the Aim
                  of a Treatise (\emph{prayojana})},
  journal =	 wzks,
  volume =	 "39",
  pages =	 "181--201",
  year =	 1995,
}

I am not aware of studies on the Brahmanical side, but I find Kumārila's Ślokavārttika, Pratijñāsūtra 11–25, the beginnings of Nyāyabhāṣya/Nyāyavārttika, to be relatively early treatment of the issue.

Interesting is the beginning of the Vaiyākaraṇamahābhāṣya where those terms, though padārtha instead of abhidheya, are used but in a different context.
