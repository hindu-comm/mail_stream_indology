In RaamaayaNa 3,22,1 "a rumbling storm cloud" (mahaameghas tumulo),  
"ruddy as the wild ass" (gardabhaaruNaH, not "mule-gray" as translated  
by Pollock 1990: III,133), "rained water red as blood" (zoNitodakam  
abhyavarSat). This is one of many ominous portents mentioned in this  
context.

Best regards, Asko Parpola
