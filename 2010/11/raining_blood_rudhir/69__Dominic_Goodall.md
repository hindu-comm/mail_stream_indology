Raining blood (along with earthquakes, the weeping of images and many other portents) is included in an account of Adbhutaśānti in the Pūrva-Kāraṇāgama (p. 714 of edition of 1921 [Kaliyuga 5023]):

It seemed quite closely related to the little studied genre of “Tantric meteorology” such as can be found in the Bhairavīyameghamālā, that it might even be best identified as a separate genre: Tantric agriculture (?). I remember seeing an MS of this in the Wellcome Institute in London but cannot now find my photocopies of it.
