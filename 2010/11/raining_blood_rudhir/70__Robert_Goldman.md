Although the exact terms vary, the raining of blood is mentioned  
frequently in the Yuddhakāṇḍa of the Vālmīkirāmāyaṇa as one  
of the portents of calamity for the warrior to whom they appear. See  
the following verses in the critical edition:  6.26.22; 6.31.5;  
6.41.33; 6.83.33; 6.94.15. The most common expression is vavarṣa  
rudhiram...
