>From the Karaṉ Vataip Paṭalam (Āraṇiya Kāṇṭam), Kamparāmāyaṇam:

69. 3040

Hearing those words, a Rākṣasa came
     whose name was Akampana, of great learning
and one among them who had good to him,
     and he said, “Lord! Let me say something.
It is right to be very fierce in battle,
     O you who are most virile among
all heroes!  but around this action
     we pursue, there have been evil omens.

70. 3041

“The clouds have been roaring, pouring down
     a very great rain of blood
and the Sun God, look at him,
     he is surrounded by a halo!
Notice how there are flocks of crows
     that hover above your flag
and fight each other, fall, cry out,
     and fallen roll on the earth...."

The relevant Tamil is:
kuruti mā maḻai corintaṉa
	mēkaṅkaḷ kumuṟi

No doubt there are other instances in Kampaṉ, since he was following Vālmīki.  I have not found anything in Sangam Literature.  George Hart

> Although the exact terms vary, the raining of blood is mentioned frequently in the Yuddhakāṇḍa of the Vālmīkirāmāyaṇa as one of the portents of calamity for the warrior to whom they appear. See the following verses in the critical edition:  6.26.22; 6.31.5; 6.41.33; 6.83.33; 6.94.15. The most common expression is vavarṣa rudhiram...

It seemed quite closely related to the little studied genre of “Tantric meteorology” such as can be found in the Bhairavīyameghamālā, that it might even be best identified as a separate genre: Tantric agriculture (?). I remember seeing an MS of this in the Wellcome Institute in London but cannot now find my photocopies of it.
