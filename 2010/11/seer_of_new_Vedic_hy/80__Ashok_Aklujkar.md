Dear Allen,

The pressure of other commitments is keeping me away from participating in some of the list discussions. 

The information you need is probably:

Daivaraata Brahmar.si. 1968. Chando-dar;sanam daivaraataar.seyam. ;Srii-kaavya-ka.n.tha-ga.na-pati-muni-viracita-vaasi.s.thaanvaya-bhaa.sye.na pari.sk.rtam. Bombay: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.

Later on, the same 'seer' person probably edited the following collection of Vedic passages bearing on vaac.

Daivaraata, Brahmar.si/Mahar.si. 1971 = sa.mvat 2028. Vaak Sudhaa. Calcutta: Madana-gopaala Poddaara Cairi.tii .Trasâ€ a [= Charity Trust].
