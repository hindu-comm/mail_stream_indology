Dear Colleagues, 

I have a question that Randy Kloetzli has asked me to communicate to INDOLOGY: "Is there some scholarship regarding the number known as the  koti? Its value is 10 to the 7th power or 1 followed by 7 zeroes. Monier-Williams says only that it is the largest of the old order of numbers." 

If a conversation emerges here, I will communicate it to Randy. Or you could write him offline at catrandu at comcast.net.

Thanks, Alf
