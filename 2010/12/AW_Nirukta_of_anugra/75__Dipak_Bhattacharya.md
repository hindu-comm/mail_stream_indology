To avoid misunderstanding I should add that, as explicitly in the Kauś.S, the sense of anu in the Rgveda too is more of the sequence (colouring the verb) than of favour. The literal sense prevails. The future might have been in shape but was not yet accomplished.

Dear All,
The semantics of 'favour, promote, take care' is the one and only for the
composite verb ánu+gra(b)hi, attested since the RV; please refer to my Verba
IndoArica (Vienna: Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1997) I/403 (no. 506S).
> From this verb the action noun anugraha/anuggaha- 'favour etc.' is formed
according to productive rules in the late Vedic Suutra / Early Buddhist
period, as a look into Vishva Bandhu's Vaidikapadaanukramako;sa and the
Critical Pali Dictionary will make clear to everybody.
With my best wishes for the second decade of the 3rd millenium
Chlodwig H. Werba

The sense of ‘favour’ in anugraha – anu-g?h originally ‘to accept
subsequently’, cf., Kausika S.56.14 --does not appear to be old, at least
not Vedic. The sense of favour could have grown by way of its employment as
an antonym of nigraha ‘obstruction’ Yaska, N.1.3, ‘rebuke’, ‘tormenting’,
Nyaya-S. 1.2.20. The pair of antonyms may be found the Bhakti and
Pratyabhijña literature.

Dear esteemed colleagues,

In an inquiry apropos to the holiday season, I wonder if any of you have
ever seen a nirukta or nirvacana of anugraha, explaining its derivation,
since there is no obvious connection (that I can see) between anu + grah and
the meanings of anugraha.

thank you,
Chris
