Harisvāmin’s commentary on the Śatapatha-Br.1.8.1.2 aughá imāḥ sárvvāḥ prajā́ḥ nirvvoḍhā runs as : sa imāḥ bhāratavarṣanivāsinīḥ prajāḥ nirvoḍhā niḥśeśaṃ deśāntaraṃ prāpayitā. The word will be found in all the major Purāṇas in Jambudvīpavarṇanam. Cf.,Matsya-P.122.te bhāratasya varṣasya bhedā yena prakīirtitāḥ . Emperor Asoka knew only the word Jambudvīpa.

Dear esteemed colleagues,

Happy holidays. I am reading and translating a very late ha.tha-yoga text
called the Yoga-Kar.nikaa, the date of which can possibly be determined by
its use of the phrase* sarvatiirthe.su bhaarate*. Does anyone know the
earliest usage of Bhaarata in the meaning "India"? I am guessing 19th
century, but I really don't know.

thank you,
Chris Wallis
