Thanks for the additional information, Gautama-Mahodaya,

I read your article in its entirety. You are right about the context  
of the parī-śāsa requiring the assumption of a single item, and you  
may be right that it is a horn (even though that's an interpretation).  
However, cutting out one horn from an antelope does not require the  
assumption that the animal has only one horn — there isn't anything  
in the context which would establish that we are dealing with a one- 
horned animal. That there would be two such items for the ritual (the  
parīśāsau) would, of course, make sense, given your interpretation  
of the instrument as consisting of two horns; but again, neither the  
situation nor the grammar requires that the source for these two horn  
be two different animals, rather than just one.

So, much as I would not want to disagree with you, I cannot say that I  
am convinced.

Best wishes/sapraṇāmam

Hans
