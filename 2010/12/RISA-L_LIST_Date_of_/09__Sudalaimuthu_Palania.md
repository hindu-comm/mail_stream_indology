If I remember right, the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata is dated between 400BC - 400CE. The date of the Hāthīgumphā inscription of Khāravela falls within a narrower range, possibly 2nd half of 1st century BC. According to Jayaswal and Banerji, Khāravela has used Bharadavasa (Skt. Bhāratavarṣa) to refer to the plains of north India. (See EI, vol. 20, p. 78)
