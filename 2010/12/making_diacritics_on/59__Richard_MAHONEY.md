A long while ago I put together a file that enables Emacs users to
input utf8 characters -- and yes, thanks again to Stefan for showing
me how such a thing was possible. It works by using `postfix
modifiers' and is completely configurable depending on what one
prefers. All one needs to do is alter the file, adding keystrokes that
are convenient. For Emacs users out there, I'm attaching a copy.

There are also more details here:

 UTF-8 input framework for GNU Emacs: utf-8-input.el.
 http://indica-et-buddhica.org/sections/repositorium-preview/materials/software/emacs-utf8-input-framework


I have used this system for years on various UNIX systems. I take it
that it should also work with Emacs under Linux, Windows and on Macs.



Kind regards,

 Richard
