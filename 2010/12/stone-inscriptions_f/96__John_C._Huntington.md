These are interesting, in that there seem to be at least four of them as Michael Witzel's image adds a fourth.

It is important that they are either "from"or "currently in" Sichuan as they reflect art of the Da Li kingdom of Yunnan rather closely  and I presume had their origin in Da Li or near by. 

A very important although less well know painting, Now in the National Palace Museum, Taipei by Chang Sheng-wen (Flourished ca. 1160-1190) demonstrates both the sanskrit inscriptions and some of the cap types of the figures in the four inscriptions.

The Scroll is about the Nan Zhao State Talisman, the "True Image of Avalokiteshvara" and associated iconographics

Most of the scroll is posted on the Huntington Archive website
