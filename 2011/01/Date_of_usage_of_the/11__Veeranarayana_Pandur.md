there are few verses can be quoted here for a rethinking
(I am not sure of exact location or numbers of references quoted)

अत्रापि भारतं श्रेष्ठं जम्बूद्वीपे महामुने।
यतो हि कर्मभूरेषा ह्यतोन्या भोगभूमयः।।  विष्णुपुराणे quoted in वीरमित्रोदय

अहो बतैषां किमकारि शोभनं प्रसन्न एषां स्विदुत स्वयं हरिः।
यैर्जन्म लब्धं नृषु भारताजिरे मुकुन्दसेवौपयिकस्पृहात्मभिः।।
कल्पायुषां स्थानजयात् पुनर्भवात् क्षणायुषां भारतभूजयो वरः। भागवते

भारतद्वीपदेशो वै दक्षिणे बहुविस्तरः।
एवमेकमिदं वर्षं बहुद्वीपमिहोच्यते।। वायुपुराणे 48.42

संप्राप्य भारते जन्म सत्कर्मसु पराङ्मुखः। बृहन्नारदीये 3.65-71

निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
