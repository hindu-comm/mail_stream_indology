A very happy new year to all.
Could anyone help me by putting me in touch with teachers at Sanskrit
schools in the West, or letting me know the names of such schools.  I know
of St James' in London and John Scottus in Ireland - and have contacts there
- so am looking for any schools other than these two.
This is in connection with the Sanskrit Book Fair that is being held in
Bangalore this week.  The organisers are hoping to understand why schools in
the West teach Sanskrit.
Thank you very much in advance for your help.
Best,
Venetia
