I know of the following two translations of Shakespeare into Sanskrit:

1. A Midsummer Night's Dream: Krishnamachari,R. "Vasantikaswapnam: An 
Adaptation of Shakespeare's Midsummer-Night's Dream" (Madras, 1892).

2. Hamlet: Sukhamoy Mukhopadhyay, D카n훮rkar훮jakum훮ra-Hemalekham (Delhi: 
Motilal Banarsidass, 1971).

Does anyone know of other examples?

Thanks

Richard Salomon
