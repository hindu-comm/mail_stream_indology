Thanks for the image, Madhav.

Seems to me a conflation of all things "sciency" -- (i.e., linguistics, writing, math (as numbers),  astrology).  An ahistorical valorization of "ancient wisdom," I suppose.

>From a practical point of view: the numbers and sun serve to frame the central image (the numbers thematically next to other numbers on one side -- 5 Rs and year; bhārat/India, swāstika, sun, and name on the other side).  The sun, the manuscripts on the ground, and bhārat/India especially keeps the overall image from being "left heavy".  More perfect symmetry might put "India" further down (or Pāṇini himself more towards the center), but visually that might look overly contrived.
