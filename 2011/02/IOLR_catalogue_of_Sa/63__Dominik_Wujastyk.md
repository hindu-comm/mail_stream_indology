The following volume is a fine piece of bibliographical scholarship, and
still an essential guide to the IOLR's printed collections (now amalgamated
in the BL collections, but mostly not yet added to the OPAC).*

*
*Catalogue of the Library of the India Office, vol. 2, part 1: Sanskrit
books*.
Natha, P., Chaudhuri, J.B. and Napier, C.F.
London, 1938-1957.
4 vols.

Does anyone know of a scanned version?  I don't see one in archive.org or
the DLI.

Thanks,
Dominik
