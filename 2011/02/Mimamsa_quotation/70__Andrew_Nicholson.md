Dear Indologists,

Can someone please point me to the source of the following quotation:

viSayo vizayaz caiva pUrvapakSas tathottaram /
nirNayaz ceti paJcAGgaM zAstre 'dhikaraNaM smRtam //

There is a similar sloka in Khandadeva's Bhattadipika (comm. on Jaimini
1.2.7), but I have not found the source of this precise quote from the
pandit I was working with. Other versions of the sloka would also be
welcome.

Thanks!

Andrew
