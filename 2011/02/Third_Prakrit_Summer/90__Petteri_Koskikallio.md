Dear list,

We are pleased to announce the 3rd Prakrit Summer School (July 26 - August
6, 2011) in Ghent, Belgium. A similar introductory course in
Jaina-Maharastri took place in Finland in 2007 and in WÃ¼rzburg in 2009. The
PSS is also this time going to focus on the Jain epic and narrative
material.

For details see:

Please inform any students who may be interested in participating.


With best wishes,
Eva De Clercq (evadeclercq at gmail.com)
