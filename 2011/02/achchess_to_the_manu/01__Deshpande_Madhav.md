Dear Indologists,

     I am currently reading the Madhyamakahṛdayakārikā of Bhāvaviveka with a student, and, among the related published material, have a photocopy of the manuscript-photos as published in "Papers in Honour of Prof. Dr. Ji Xianlin on the  Occasion of His 80th Birthday".  However, these photos are almost unreadable even with a magnifying lens.  I was wondering if anyone on this list has access to better quality images of the Sanskrit manuscript?  Any suggestions are welcome.  Best,

Madhav
