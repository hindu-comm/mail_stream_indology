Dear Colleagues,

A local gentleman, a California winemaker by profession, visited me  
today to ask me about a book in his possession that had belonged to  
his late grandfather.  Upon inspection I found it to be a two volume  
set consisting of a handwritten English translation of the Adhyātma  
Rāmāyaṇa with an introduction by one Anand Ghan who describes  
himself  as "A Member of the College of Brahmins at Benares" and who  
claims that he translated the text from "Sanscrit into Persian" and  
"Again translated from the Persian into English".  It is dated 1804  
and appears to have been purchased in India, perhaps by the  
grandfather for Rs. 8.

The book is in quite good condition. The handwriting is quite clear  
and the English excellent.

The owner was reluctant to leave the book with me but  I was able to  
take  two images from it that I snapped with my mobile phone. One is  
of the title page of the first volume and one is from a randomly  
opened page to show what the text itself looks like.

I would be interested to know if any of you know anything about  Pt.  
Ghan or the history of his double translation.



Best wishes.
