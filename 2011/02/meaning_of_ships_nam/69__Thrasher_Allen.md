Don,

Thanks for the tip.  The Wiki article says the ship was out of Surat.  I have paged two eds. of the trial proceedings and will see if they throw any light on this issue.

Allen,

Just a shot in the dark, but both names look to me as if they could both be permutations of Dravidian kuTaku/kuTakam=Coorg.  It is possible that the ship and man come from this region of South India?

Best, Don
