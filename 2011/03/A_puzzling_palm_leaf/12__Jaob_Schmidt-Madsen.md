Hi Dan

That's the third vote I get for scribal exercise, and none for the others,
so a pattern definitely seems to be emerging. However, one thing I would
like to ask you, and everybody else, is how such a sheet might have been
kept with the manuscript since it is not fitted with holes for binding. I
only have six stray leaves (five of them holed), but somehow they have
survived together.

Thanks for the input,

Jacob
