Dear List,

I have a request from a dear friend and colleague who is not a Vedicist, who
seeks access to B's concordance.  I have tried to download my pdf file of
this to her but my email programs are not able to send such large
documents.  Can someone help me help her to gain access to this very useful
concordance?

Thanks in advance.

George Thompson
