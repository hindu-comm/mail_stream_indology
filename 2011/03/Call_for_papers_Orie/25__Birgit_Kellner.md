Dear colleagues!

At the University of Salamanca we have decided to commemorate with an
International Conference of Orientalists the fact that 700 years ago 
Pope Clemens II urged through a "canon" the universities of Salamanca, 
Bologna, Paris and Oxford to teach oriental languages, thus giving the 
first impulse to Oriental Studies in Europe.

The conference will take place at Salamanca the 28th-30th September 2011.

We attach You our "Call for papers", and we would greatly appreciate You
to communicate this event to other colleagues of Indian Studies.

Best wishes

Ana Agud
Universidad de Salamanca
