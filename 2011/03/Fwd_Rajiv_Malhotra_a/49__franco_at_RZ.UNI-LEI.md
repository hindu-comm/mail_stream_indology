Dear McComas, on Halbfass's stance on Orientalism see also his  
introductory essay in "Beyond Orientalism" ed. Franco/Preisendanz.
Best,
Eli

Zitat von Philipp Maas <phmaas at ARCOR.DE>:

> Dear McComas,
> I read your article on Mythology Wars and found it for the most  
> part well written and informative.
>
> I would, however, suggest considering to change the passage we  
> cannot deny that Oriental Studies was the handmaiden of colonialism  
> and imperialism into a less general statement. As it stands, it is  
> (at least) a gross oversimplification of the complex motives and  
> methods of early oriental studies. I dont know if you read  
> Halbfass India and Europe. If not, I strongly recommend it to  
> you. I am sure you will enjoy the reading...
>
> All the best,
>
