This is really bad news - Persée is a truly invaluable resource; I've 
downloaded many articles from there (just search for Bareau, Filliozat, 
Lamotte, Levi, and the riches are just pouring in, particularly 
interesting because they also include publications in journals that are 
harder to find in libraries outside of France).

The link that Dominic sent out also includes a link to an online 
petition to keep Persée alive, which I would encourage everyone to sign.

Best regards,
