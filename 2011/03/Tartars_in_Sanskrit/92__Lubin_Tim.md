I have always been led to believe that 'Tartar' was a European corruption of 'Tātār' (as in Persian), perhaps by association with Latin Tartarus.  In that case, I would have expected a Sanskrit rendering to be begin taataar- or taatar-, no?  Or are matters less clearcut than that?  Perhaps you can give us the relevant snippet.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tartars in Sanskrit?


I should be very interested to know of any instances of terms like 
tārtīya or tārtīyaka, with the meaning 'Tartar', in (late) Sanskrit 
literature. I have come across a single occurrence, in the Tājikabhūṣaṇa 
(16th-17th cent.), where this seems to be the only reasonable meaning of 
the word (it is definitely not related to tṛtīya); but I haven't found 
it in any dictionary.
