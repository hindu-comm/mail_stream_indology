By the way, I ran the term "homonym" past my students today.  Most of them,
of course, didn't have a clue about what it meant.  But a few of them did
know that a homonym was a set of words  that sounded alike but that meant
different things.

Are these students, art school students with no pretensions to being
linguists, actually better linguists than Singleton of Doniger?

Well, I wouldn't know....
