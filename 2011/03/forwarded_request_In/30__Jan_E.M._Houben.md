From: Viktoria Lyssenko <vglyssenko at yandex.ru>To: indology at liverpool.ac.ukDate: Sat, 19 Feb 2011 17:08:16 +0300Subject: a paper from Indogaku Bukkyogaku Kenkyu, 1 4.Dear all!Does anyone have access to an electronic copy of Kajiyama Yuichi's paper "Controversy between the sakara- and nirakara-vadins of the Yogacara school - Some materials", published in Indogaku Bukkyogaku Kenkyu, 1 4, 1965, p.26-37. I have looked through the on line-archive of this journal but this paper was not there.Any other enlightening materials on this difficult subject are also welcome! I am trying to write an entry about this subject for the Encyclopedia of Buddhist Philosophy which is under preparation in my Institute, but the more I read the less I understand: those whom I believed to be nirakaravadins seem to be sakaravadins, and vice versa.Best regards,Victoria LysenkoResearch Professor,Institute of PhilosophyRussian Academy of SciencesMoscow
