Dear Dominic,

An early attestation for the terms in the context of praa.naayaama is the
Nyaayaagamaanusaari.nii of Si.mhasuuri (C6th?), the commentary on the
Dvaada"saaranayacakra of Mallavaadin. The terms occur in an important
passage on .Sa.da"ngayoga, clearly referring to a "Saiva tradition of yoga,
thus confirming your hypothesis. The passage (p.332, ll. 18--20, edition
Jambuuvijayajii) reads as follows:

praa.naayaamas trividha.h -- recaka.h kumbhaka.h puuraka iti| tatra recaka
aantara.m vaayu.m bahir ni.skraa"sayati naasikaadvaare.na| puuraka.h baahyam
anta.h prave"sya puurayati| kumbhaka.h puur.nakumbhavad aspanda.m vaayu.m
saamiipyenaavasthaapayati|

I don't know of an earlier source for these terms than Kau.n.dinya's work.

Best wishes,
Peter
