Dear list,

I hope you won't mind a another terminological discussion related to yoga !

Is it known when the terminology of recaka, pūraka/pūraṇa, kumbhaka first started to be used for prāṇāyāma ?

It seems that the Yogasūtra (2.49) and Yogabhāṣya speak rather of śvāsa and praśvāsa (in 2.49).  

In the tradition of commentaries on the sūtras perhaps it is the Yogabhāṣyavivaraṇa which first uses the recaka-pūraka-kumbhaka terminology ?

Kauṇḍinya’s Pañcārthabhāṣya (on Pāśupata 1.16) refers to recaka and pūraṇa. Are there other attestations likely to be earlier than the Yogabhāṣyavivaraṇa ?
