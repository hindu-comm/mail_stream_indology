Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Can someone share with me the following edition of the Svāyambhuvatantra in a PDF form ? I would highly appreciate your help. You may write to me off-list. Thank you very much in advance.

<<Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṃgraha edited by: Veṅkaṭasubrahmaṇya śāsrtī, Mahīśūradharmasaṃsthāna, Mysore, 1937.>>

Yours sincerely,

Mrinal Kaul
