Dear members of the list,

I am having trouble trying to obtain copies of the following two doctoral
theses:

Miśra, Adya Prasada (1966). *Prakriyākaumudī-vimarśaḥ* (=Sarasvatī Bhavana
Studies 15). Varanasi: Vārāṇaseya Saṃskṛta Viśvavidyālaya. [A Vārāṇaseya
Saṃskṛta Viśvavidyālaya doctoral dissertation from 1964].

Saini, R. S. (1965). *Post-Pāṇinian systems of Sanskrit grammar, with
special reference to their technique and scope*. Delhi. [Unpublished].

Would any of you know from where I might be able to obtain copies of these
or, perhaps, have a reference to someone who might know?

Many thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Jesper Larnæs
