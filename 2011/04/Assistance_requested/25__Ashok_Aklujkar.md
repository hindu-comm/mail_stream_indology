The first doctoral dissertation is also published. It is written in Skt. The details of publication are almost all the same as given by Jesper Larnæs. Only the series volume number should be "16" instead of "15". I have a copy of it. I would expect many North American libraries to have it, too. Perhaps the publisher also can still supply a copy.
