This volume is available here:
http://ia600301.us.archive.org/34/items/indischestudien07gesegoog/indischestudien07gesegoog.pdf

Internet Archive has quite a number of volumes:

These are mostly from Google, but not all of them are still available from Google directly, and people outside the U.S. often cannot get access to the free Google books, but Internet Archive has their own archived copy of the pdf under the link:

Can anyone point me to or supply to me pdf of Hermann Oldenberg's edition of the "Saa"nkhaayanag.rhyasuutra that appeared inIndische Studien 15(1878), or, better still, to a complete set of the Indische Studien (if this series has already been digitized completely)?
Many thanks!
