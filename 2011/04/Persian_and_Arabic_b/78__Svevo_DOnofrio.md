Dear colleague,

one the earliest instances (11th century) of a Sanskrit text incorporating several Perso-Arabic loanwords in a Sanskritized form is the Buddhist Kālacakra Tantra. 
John Newman's article Islam in the Kālacakra Tantra, "Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies", vol. 21, no. 2, 1998: 311-371 gives several examples and even has a list (p. 333) of such words.

Best,
Svevo D'Onofrio

However, this list does not quite tally with the examples I have seen in Sanskrit astrological works dating (probably) from the 13th century or earlier. One obvious possible explanation is that pronunciation had changed over the intervening centuries.
