Dear Colleagues/Friends,

A student of mine is looking for the original Sanskrit text for the

ZaaGkhaayana AaraNyaka ("Saa'nkhaayana Aara.nyaka)

The English version was written by

Keith, A. B. K. 1908. "Saa'nkhaayana Aara.nyaka with an Appendix on  
the Mahaavrata. London: The Royal Asiatic Society.

If anyone knows how to access the original Sanskrit, I would  
appreciate the information.
Thanks and best wishes to all
Stella Sandahl

P.S. You may respond directly to bryanl at guidelinesad.com  or  
bryan.levman at utoronto.ca
since I will not have access to my computer until April 22nd.
