 My son is looking for an intensive program in Sanskrit this summer,
hopefully more than a couple of weeks. He's had 4 years training, but is a
bit rusty and would profit from a 3rd year or very intense 2nd year (say
reading the epics or dharmasastras with commentaries). Does anybody know of
anything like that? I'm aware of the Wisconsin program but not others. He is
not currently enrolled anywhere.

A second question. He might profit from a year in India, just as a special
student in Sanskrit and other Indian cultural areas (music, etc.). Any ideas
of institutions that might accept an independent scholar for such purpose?
