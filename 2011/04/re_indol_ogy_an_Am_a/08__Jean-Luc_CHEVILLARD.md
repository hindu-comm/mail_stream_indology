Greetings from Pondicherry,

the comparison is apparently also found in the Teevaaram,
a collection of Tamil hymns to Siva,
possibly dating back to the 7th and 8th centuries.

See:
"http://www.ifpindia.org/ecrire/upload/digital_database/Site/Digital_Tevaram/U_TEV/VMS5_072.HTM#p2"
<http://www.ifpindia.org/ecrire/upload/digital_database/Site/Digital_Tevaram/U_TEV/VMS5_072.HTM#p2>

The text reads:
"kaiyil aamalakak kan_i okkumee"
(teevaaram, 5-72, 2)

The normal Tamil name of that fruit is "nelli"

-- Jean-Luc Chevillard (EFEO/CNRS)
