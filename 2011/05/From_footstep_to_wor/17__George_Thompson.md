Dear List,

I have been asked for a copy of my paper From ‘footstep’ to ‘word’
in Sanskrit, an old article of mine which I myself do nothave access
to [!!!].

It is:

>â€‰From ‘footstep’ to ‘word’ in Sanskrit, which was published in Semiotica 1995.

Is this something that someone can easily pass on to me, as a pdf?

And isn't it absurd that an author of a paper has to ask for this kind of help?

George Thompson
