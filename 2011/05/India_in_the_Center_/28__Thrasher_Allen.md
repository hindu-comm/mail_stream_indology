I discovered this project < http://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/history-of-emotions/focus-india > from an email announcement to the membership of the South Asia Microform Project (SAMP) at Center for Research Libraries, Chicago, that the Center of the History of Emotions has just joined SAMP.  This is the first institution to join SAMP outside of the U.S. and Canada.

SAMP's homepage is < http://www.crl.edu/area-studies/samp >.  Perhaps other non-North American institutions might consider joining, even in the current stringency.
