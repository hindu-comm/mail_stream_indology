Indologists--

I have a student (from New Delhi, actually) who is interested in writing his undergraduate thesis on Astrology.  I would appreciate your bibliographic suggestions, since I'm not sure how much material will be accessible to him (in English or Hindi) that is not overly technical.  I know of Martin Gansten's book on Nadi Astrology.

Thanks for any references.
