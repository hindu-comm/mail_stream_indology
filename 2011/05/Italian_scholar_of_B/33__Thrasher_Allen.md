I have received a request from a municipal library in Italy asking for guidance in assembling a small collection of Bengali books.  Are there any scholars of Bengali literature in Italy to whom I could refer the librarians for guidance?  (I am also of course suggesting some other routes.)

Thanks,

Allen
