Richard Schmidt: Nachträge zum Sanskrit-Wörterbuch (1928), p. 194 lists 
jhakaṭaka, "Streit" (quarrel); Jhakaṭakasāra, proper name; jhagaṭaka. He 
does not have an entry bhakaṭaka.

Google Books gives some results, too. E.g., Abhijit Ghosh: Non-Aryan 
linguistic elements in the Atharvaveda: a study of some words of Austric 
origin. Calcutta: Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 2000, p. 158 (for jhakaṭaka).

Hope it helps
