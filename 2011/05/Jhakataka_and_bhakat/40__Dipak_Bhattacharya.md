Dear Friends,
By appearance jhakataka is of onomatopoeic origin, like cakacaka and cikacika, both attested and capable of giving rise to derivatives
like cākacakya and alikes. Also look into the NIA adverbs jhakjhak and taktak ‘shining’ ‘exquisite’. 
But please examine the available cases because I myself have not and am not
in a position to do. I have no desire of unintentionally misleading.
Best wishes
DB

Excellent -- thank you very much! Bha- may, of course, easily be a 
misreading for jha- in some scripts.
