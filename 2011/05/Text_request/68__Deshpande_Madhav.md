Dear members of the list,
I need to find a copy of Sanskrit text 'śakunārṇava' = 'śakuna' of Vasantarāja (11 century) for my master's theses.
The text was published 1940, Mumbānagara, 1963, Bombay, reprinted 1987, Mumbaī .
If anyone has access to an electronic version, please share the link. Or may be it can be ordered from a library.
Thank you

Anna Kavaleuskaya
