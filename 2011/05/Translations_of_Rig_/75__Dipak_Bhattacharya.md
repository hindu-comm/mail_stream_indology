Dear
Colleagues,

I
regret that I forgot to mention the following study extensively dealing, inter
alia, with the relation between RV 1.164 and the Avāntaradīkṣā/Pravargya. A
worthwhile reading the approach of the author is marked by scrupulous avoidance
of mystery-mongering and convincingly establishing the ritual connection, with what
one may call a no nonsense approach without fanfare.

Best

DB

A colleague asked me for recommended translations of the Rig Veda Suparna Sukta (RV I.164).

I've been meaning to get around to working with it myself but, like so many things, I haven't gotten around to it.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Best,

Dean
