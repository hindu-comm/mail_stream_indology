Dear Indologists,

Could anyone of you share with me Adhyāyas 17 and 18 of the
 Cidambaramāhātmya or direct me where to find them? The copy of the 1971 edition I have received through interlending service (the only accessible library copy in Germany) is missing these.

I would be very grateful indeed.
