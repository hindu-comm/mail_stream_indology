Thanks for appreciation. The Harvard/Kyoto (or if you like: Kyoto/Harvard) input was part of TeX
Live before (and might be already on you computer).

I've just added another IAST.map, there are already others around (like Somadeva's). The whole
packet still needs some improvements, the need for "manual" Virama here is very ouch. Wanted to ask
ZdenÄ›k Wagner if he wouldn't donate his Velthuis map, that would make a wrap (is even somewhat
orphaned at the other packet). So, next revision is coming up soon.

If you like, please follow improvements at:

Greetings,
Daniel
