Dear colleagues,

A student recently asked me if I could recommend some clear, beautiful,
accurate recitation of Sanskrit Å›lokas or other verses or even connected
prose.  He has about two years Sanskrit under his belt, but hasn't got the
language strongly in his ears yet.

Can you recommend any easily-available recordings, videos, or other media
(free?) that would fit the bill?

Many thanks
Dominik
