there is a journal called "drk" fully dedicated to critical evaluation of
modern samskrita literature. it is published from Allahabad. most of the
contemporary critics and poets publish their critiques and poetries therein.
it is edited by Banamali Biswal who can be contacted by , "banamali biswal"
<banamali7 at gmail.com>.
offcourse there are many a seminars organised on this subject by many poets.
you can contack prof. Tarashankara sharma on who organised/part of some of
these seminars. he can be contacted prof.tspandeya at gmail.com, whose father
Pandit Mohanlal sharma, is a recipient of many awards in poetry like Padmini
etc.
since I have nothing to do with poetry, I have no biblio records on hand.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि।
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः।
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
