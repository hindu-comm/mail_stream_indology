Subject: RE: [INDOLOGY] Contemporary Sanskrit poetry

There is a 1963 Marathi book by Shridhar Bhaskar Warnekar titled Arvachin Samskrita Sahitya giving a detailed survey of modern Skt lit.  A massive volume of Warnekar's own poetic contribution was also published after he passed away.  His epic poem on Shivaji titled Shivarajyodayam is a wonderful example of a modern poet who in some ways rivals Kalidasa.  There are other surveys of modern Skt lit including those by Ramaji Upadhyaya in Hindi.  I don't know of any significant work in English, and the western research in general is under the illusion of "Death of Sanskrit."
