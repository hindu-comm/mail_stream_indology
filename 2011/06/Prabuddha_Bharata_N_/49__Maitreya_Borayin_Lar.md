Dear list,

Would anyone have access to a copy of the "Prabuddha Bharata" N° 68 (July,
1963). This is the journal from the Advaita Ashrama. I am looking for a
short article by M. P. Pandit entitled "Guru-Sishya Tradition" that appeared
there (pp. 389-92).
If anyone has access to it could you please send me a copy off-list?

Further reading suggestions on the topic* guruśiṣyasambhandha* are also
welcomed.
Thank you all.

Best wishes,
