A colleague who is not on Indology has asked me a question to which I do not have a ready answer. So I promised him that I will post it on Indology, which generally elicits great answers from the pandit-network worldwide. The question relates to any studies done on the contrasting themes of "paśubhāva, vīrabhāva, and divyabhāva" -- I assume within the Śaiva-Tantrik traditions. Thanks for any leads.
