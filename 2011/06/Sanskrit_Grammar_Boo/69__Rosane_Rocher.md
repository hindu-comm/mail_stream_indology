I don't know of electronic copies - hard copies are, of course, 
available in the British Library.
Note, however, that Colebrooke's incomplete grammar was published first, 
in 1805, and was already printed in 1804 as shown on his own 
pre-publication, preface-less copy in the BL.  Carey's grammar came out 
second, in 1806.  Forster's, the third of three Sanskrit grammars that 
were under preparation at the same time in Calcutta, followed in 1810.
