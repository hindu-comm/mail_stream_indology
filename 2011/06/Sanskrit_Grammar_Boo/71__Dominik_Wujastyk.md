Dear Richard,
Is the full digitised text available to you from the Hathi trust?  When I go
to that link, it says it's under restricted copyright and won't let me see
the book, only search for snippets.  Your record says it's in the public
domain (which it is).

Keep thinking of you with the new earthquake.  How are you and your family?

Dominik
