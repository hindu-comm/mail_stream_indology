Many thanks to George Cardona and Gary Tubb for their learned corrections
and clarifications on the "dviṣam dviṣam" issue.

 Dear Dominik, When you suggest taking dviṣaṁ dviṣam as an iterated gerund
with -am, I suppose you mean the type accounted for by Pāṇini's *ābhīkṣṇye
ṇamul ca* (3.4.22).  However, this would then be *dveṣaṁ dveṣam*, like *bhojaṁ
bhojam*.  I suggest that the phrase in your text has iteration as accounted
for by *nityavīpsayoḥ* and means 'every single one who hates them'.
 Regards, George
