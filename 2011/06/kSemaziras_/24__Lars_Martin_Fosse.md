Dear members of the list,

I have come across an expression in the Kamasutra which leaves me completely
dumbfounded. In KS 5.6.25, I find the following:

( anyaizca jalabrahma+kSemaziraH+praNItairbAhyapAnakairvA ). 

This seems to be a marginal comment. I am unable to come up with a
translation of kSemaziras. Would anybody have a suggestion?

Best regards,

Lars Martin Fosse
