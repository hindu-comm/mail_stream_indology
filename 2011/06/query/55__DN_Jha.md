Dear List,
One of my former students is seeking bibliographic information on
poisons and their treatment in ancient India. Since I am familiar with
literature on the subject I am giving below her request for help:
 "I am looking for material for a paper on poisons, anti-venom drugs and
treatment in ancient India. I haven't come across too many secondary
writings on this."
