My book _The Roots of Ayurveda_ contains a translation of the first two
chapters from the kalpasthana of the Susrutasamhita that deal with with
attempts at poisoning a king and with poisons of vegetable origin.  In the
introduction, I discuss the history of poisoning in India, the Venomous
Virgin, and the spread in the medieval ME and Europe of Indian poison texts
such as the pseudo-Canakya "Kitab al-Sumum," and the Venomous Virgin motif
especially through through the Arabic Kitab Sir al-Asrar, the Latin Secretum
Secretorum, and the popular Gesta Romanorum.

Best,
Dominik
