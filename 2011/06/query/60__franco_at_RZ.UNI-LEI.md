There are multiple references in Buddhist and Nyāya literature to the  
power of mantras to cure snake bites, etc. This generally accepted  
“fact” has become the standard example for the visible results of the  
Vedic rituals and is used to infer the general validity of the Veda.  
See for instance V. Eltschinger, Dharmakīrti sur les mantra et la  
perception du supra-sensible. Wien 2001.

> such as the pseudo-Canakya "Kitab al-Sumum," and the Venomous Virgin motif
> especially through through the Arabic Kitab Sir al-Asrar, the Latin Secretum
> Secretorum, and the popular Gesta Romanorum.
