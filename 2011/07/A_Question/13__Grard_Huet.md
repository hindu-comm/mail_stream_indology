"Les inscriptions d'Asoka", traduites et commentées par Jules Bloch. Paris, Les Belles Lettres, 1950. 
This contains the decipherments of the inscriptions, in standard romanization with diacritics, according to various epigraphists. For some inscriptions, there are as many as 6 versions according to the various sources, with ample linguistic notes comparing the forms to pali and buddhist sanskrit cognates. A rather literal French translation is provided.
It has been reprinted in 2007, but the Amazon price is stiff - $65.46
