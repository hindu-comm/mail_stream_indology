Dear List,

I would be most grateful if one of you might be able to help me to
gain access to the following article:

Paul Kiparsky: "The Vedic Injunctive: Historical and Synchronic
Implications," 2005 volume of the *Yearbook of South Asian Languages
and Linguistics.*

I do not have access to this yearbook and the price to private payer
for this 15 page paper is USA $40.00!

Thank you in advance,

George Thompson
