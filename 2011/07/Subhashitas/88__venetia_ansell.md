Can anyone help a friend with the query on subhashitas below?  Thank you
very much


To judge from anthologies, it seems that in practice the sanskrit
subhashita is always considered to consist of a single verse. I have
been told a few subhashitas that define the subhashita, but none of
them mention that a subhashita should consist of a single verse. I
wonder if this criterion is made explicit in any sanskrit text.
