> Subject: [INDOLOGY] Chanting of ślokas or kāvya
>  
> Dear colleagues, 
> 
> A student recently asked me if I could recommend some clear, beautiful, accurate recitation of Sanskrit ślokas or other verses or even connected prose.  He has about two years Sanskrit under his belt, but hasn't got the language strongly in his ears yet.
> 
> Can you recommend any easily-available recordings, videos, or other media (free?) that would fit the bill?
> 
> Many thanks
> Dominik
