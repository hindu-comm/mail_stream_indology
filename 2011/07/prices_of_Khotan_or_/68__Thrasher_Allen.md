If anyone is aware of the prices of recently purchased or recently appraised Khotan mss (in Sanskrit or Khotanese) or early (pre-18th c.) mss from Nepal, could they please contact me off-list ASAP?  Also, asking prices would be of interest, whether realized or not.

I have searched the ArtFact database.

No, none of our South Asian mss are missing, but we have been asked about the very most valuable ones.

Please feel free to forward.

Thanks very much.
