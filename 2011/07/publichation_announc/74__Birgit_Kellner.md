Dear colleagues,

it is my great pleasure to announce that the proceedings of the Fourth 
International Dharmakīrti Conference just appeared in print (and I 
humbly apologize for cross-posting):

Krasser, Helmut; Lasic, Horst; Franco, Eli; Kellner, Birgit (eds.): 
Religion and Logic in Buddhist Philosophical Analysis. Proceedings of 
the Fourth International Dharmakirti Conference Vienna, August 23-27, 
2005. Vienna 2011: Austrian Academy of Sciences Press (Beiträge zur 
Kultur- und Geistesgeschichte Asiens 69). ISBN13: 978-3-7001-7000-6. (69 
EUR).

Copies can be ordered online: 
http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/products/Sachgebiete/Asienforschung/Religion-and-Logic-in-Buddhist-Philosophical-Analysis.html

The volume contains 36 essays on the Buddhist logical and 
epistemological tradition in India and Tibet, addressing its cultural, 
philosophical and religious significance. A number of contributions 
report on the remarkable (and very important) newly discovered Sanskrit 
texts by Dharmakīrti and his followers that have become available in 
recent years; the critical reception of Dharmakīrti's work in 
non-Buddhist traditions is likewise dealt with in several essays. And 
last, but most certainly not least, the volume also contains Ernst 
Steinkellner's opening speech at the conference: "News from the 
manuscript department".
