In Tamil and Malayalam some words with original ḷ are hypercorrected and pronounced with ḻ. 


Examples include the following


Ta. Āḷvār>Āḻvār (See http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~chevilla/FestSchrift/supa_9d.pdf)
Ta. kēḷvi > kēḻvi (See Comparative Dravidian Phonology by Kamil Zvelebil, 1970, p. 141)
Ma. *āḷcca > āḻcca (DEDR 5157)


Given that Jaiminīya Sāma Vedic pronunciation by Malayalam-speaking Nambudiri brahmins has iḻā, I wonder if the Sanskritists would consider that to be a case of hypercorrection for original iḷā. 


Thanks in advance.


Regards,
Palaniappan
