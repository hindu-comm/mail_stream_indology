Please pardon x-posting.

I previously announced the SARII/Asian Studies' "Alternative Ramayanas: Variations in an Epic Tradition" conference at Southern Methodist University on Sept. 24th, 2011.  This email is to let you know that free registration is now open.  Flier and abstracts are also available.
