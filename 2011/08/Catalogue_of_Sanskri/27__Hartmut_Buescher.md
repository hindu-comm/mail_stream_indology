Dear colleagues,

it is a pleasure to inform you that, with a short delay, my 
Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts: Early Acquisitions and the Nepal Collection
has now appeared as volume 7 in the series Catalogue of Oriental Manuscripts, 
Xylographs, etc. in Danish Collections (COMDC)
(http://www.niaspress.dk/books/catalogue-sanskrit-manuscripts).

It describes three of the Royal Library's (http://www.kb.dk/en/index.html) 
Sanskrit collections; these were concisely characterized in the Spring '11 issue
of the IIAS Newsletter, No. 56, p. 40 (http://issuu.com/iias/docs/iias_nl_56).


Kind regards,

Hartmut Buescher
