Dear list,

the DCS now offers the possibility to search for Sanskrit words based on 
their meanings found in the MW:
 * Activate the field "Search for meanings" on the query page (http://kjc-
fs-cluster.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=abfrage).
 * Type, for instance, *tree* to find all Sanskrit lexemes that may have to 
do something with a tree.


Please note that the results of this function do NOT prove that any of the 
meanings is also referenced in the DCS! 

Best regards,

Oliver Hellwig
