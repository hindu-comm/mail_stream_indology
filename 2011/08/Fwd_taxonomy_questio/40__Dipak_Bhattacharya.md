Asoka was a reformer breaking with the past. See Rhys David's (Buddhist 
India) remarks on how through out the ancient world the ancient 
religions of customs and ritual were replaced by new ones based on 
ethics. Asoka represented this emergent ideology.

Well, let me quit boring the participants of this list with my
konstant karping re Aśoka Edicts.

But, one more question.

If "idha na kiMci jIvaM ArabhitpA prajUhitavyaM" reflects Aśoka's will
that all earlier (Vedic) sacrifices involving killing animals be
stopped altogether, then - in what way would be his successors' power
legitimized? Aśoka's claim to power is based on his participation in
the Vedic ritual of royal consecration (abhiSeka).

Regards,

Artur Karp
