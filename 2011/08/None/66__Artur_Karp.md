Exactly.

But there is this legendary Vaishali Pillar Edict which "records King
Asoka building hospitals for both humans and animals"

See:

My sources might be already antiquated, but --- am I mistaken in
remembering that the pillar in question (The Lion Pillar of Vaishali)
carries no inscription?
