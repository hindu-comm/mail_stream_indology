Mailer Daemons seem to defend AÅ›okan veterinary hospitals. Let me
repeat my message:



No trace of your intervention, Dominik ---

at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine#History:

<<One of the edicts of Ashoka reads: "Everywhere King Piyadasi (Asoka)
erected two kinds of hospitals, hospitals for people and hospitals for
animals.>> - illustrated by the photo of the Vaishali Pillar: A pillar
in Vaishali, India, displaying edicts of Emperor Asoka>>.

Best,

Artur
