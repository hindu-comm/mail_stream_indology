In Brahmasūtra commentaries, in the section on the ineligibility of śūdras to attain Vedantic knowledge, does any commentator use the story of Śambuka (who was killed by Rāma) as an example? If not, what could be the reasons? I would appreciate any comments or references.



Thanks in advance.


Regards,
Palaniappan
