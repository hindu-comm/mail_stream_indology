Dear James and Stefan,

I should have mentioned that Prābhākara authors explicitly deny the  
existence of "spontaneously born" bodies —since they are nowhere to  
be seen (the appeal to common sense is the standard device of  
Mīmāṃsā authors).

As for your question, L. Schmithausen's work (see references in A.  
Thrasher's post) seems to confirm the idea that plants were admitted  
as a class of living beings in early India (including the earliest  
layers of the Buddhist Pāli Canon) but then a general tendency to  
rationalisation excluded them from the field of living beings in the  
śāstric literature. This might have happened at an earlier stage in  
Buddhist *texts* (due to the historical circumstances of its being a  
"new" religion and of relegating myth often outside the precincts of  
its reflection), whereas in "Hinduism" traditions favouring the  
inclusion of plants have been preserved in epics, Purāṇas, etc.

I cannot really understand what you mean by "since yoni
> here serves as the cover term they were evidently not meant to be
> covered"

Could you explain further?
