Dear Elisa,

thanks for explaining and for the reference!

In the Buddhist sources (e.g., Saṅgītisūtra and commentaries,
AKBh), yoni is not a synonym of the jarāyu kind of birth, but all
four items are considered ‘yonis’ in a more general meaning of
‘kind of birth.’ This generalization of the term for a generative
organ from the animal (and human) kingdom suggests that plants
were not a concern of the creators of this variant of the list.

All best,
Stefan
