"A sixties issue of the Polish Great Encyclopedia presented AÅ›oka, quite consistently, as a builder of the hospitals for animals. But not only. In this famous entry he was also a builder of the hospitals for plants."



Presumably only for potted plants, since digging up and moving would put a strain on plants in the ground.  Or did Maurya bureaucrats, like their British Indian successors, in anticipation of transfer do their gardening in pots so their favorites could move with them to the next station? ;-)
