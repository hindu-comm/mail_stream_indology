Thanks Adheesh, I'd forgotten about "carācara" (mobile/immobile), and thanks
for the reference.

Can we state then that what we modern folks call inanimate objects, as well
as plants, fit the acara category, and then all animals and humans fit the
cara category?  Or are there other distinctions?

My linguist colleague has clarified that she's looking specifically for the
linguistic taxonomy of this.

Cheers
James
