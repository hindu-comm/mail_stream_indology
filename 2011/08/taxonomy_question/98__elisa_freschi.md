Dear James,

I would add the distinction between "born from an uterus" (yoni-ja or  
jarāyuja), "born from an egg" (aṇḍaja), "born from sweat/ 
warmth" (svedaja) and born from water (udbhijja). The latter group  
includes all sorts of plants. The four groups seem to include all  
living beings in common understanding, but some philosophical schools  
(I am thinking now of Prābhākāra Mīmāṃsā texts specifically)  
oppose the view that also the latter ones are living beings and claim  
that they are just like stones (crystal may also grow, but are  
nonetheless non-living).

yours elisa freschi
