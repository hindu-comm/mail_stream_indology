Dear Indologists,


I need the article, "The Socio-Political Implications of Kulaśēkhara Āḻvār's Bhakti," published in the Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Bhubaneshwar, 1977. I would really appreciate if anyone with access to the article can email me a copy.




Thanks in advance.


Regards
Palaniappan
