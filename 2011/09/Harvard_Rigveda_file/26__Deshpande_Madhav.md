Hello Colleagues,

Has anyone converted the text files of the Rigveda [that were distributed with the Harvard volume of the metrically restored RV by van Nooten and Holland] to Unicode Romanization?  Would appreciate any information about such converted files and how to access them.  Thanks.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Publication Announcement

Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce the publication of my monograph:

Religion, Narrative and Public Imagination in South Asia: Past and Place in the Sanskrit Mahābhārata

London: Routledge, 2012.

ISBN:978-0-415-55863-1 (hbk)
ISBN: 978-0-203-850512-1 (ebk)

This book takes up the origin, form, content and impact of the Sanskrit Mahābhārata in early South Asia (by exploring the Sanskrit text as well as first millennium epigraphy and wider literature). It also includes, as an epilogue, a study of the Hindi televisual Mahābhārat.

I hope those who are interested enjoy it!

With All Best Wishes,

James Hegarty
