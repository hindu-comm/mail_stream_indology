In a similar vein, does anyone know if there is a downloadable transliterated unicode version of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (accented, in either recension)?  I am aware of GRETIL's version of M (no accents), JR Gardner's vedavid.org version, and the TITUS accented version of M (which is what I often use, but it is not downloadable as far as I can tell; K is listed as in preparation).

I hadn't searched for this in a long time, but in doing so now I was pleased to find that archive.org has a full scan of Eggeling's translation.

Best,

Steven
