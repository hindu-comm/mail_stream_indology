Dear Colleagues,I am looking at various Hindi words for secularism.â€˜sarva dharma samabhava' was I believe coined by M.K. Gandhi in 1930, but do any of you know if it has any earlier provenance?The other terms I am looking at are dharmanirpeksha, the most ordinary Hindi term, and 'panth nirpeksha' the term which is in the Hindi version of the constitution.Does anybody know where I can find the story of how the Hindi version of the constitution ended up with the term panth nirpeksha?Peter
