Not very long ago my wife and I started our own little publishing enterprise for Indological (and related) work (www.manyaverlag.de). My translation of a modern Kannada novel (Vikshepa by Shantinath Desai) was done in (La)TeX, and we're about to bring out a study of the Jaina pilgrimage centre Śatruñjaya by a Tübingen anthropologist, also in LaTeX.

Our main reasons for using LaTeX are the near total transparency of the commands you are giving the computer to carry out, the ease (or perhaps rather: trustworthiness) of using diacritics and the ease of maintaining a uniformity of formatting in large documents.

I also regularly use LaTeX and ConTeXt for preparing shorter documents for use in my classes, but that's probably not the sort of use Mr Bazargan was thinking of.
