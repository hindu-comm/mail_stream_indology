I came across this post in a Yahoo site just now.  It made me gasp aloud.

Jennifer asks,

What is the difference between sanskrit and Arabic?

In fact, Jennifer has received five informative answers, setting her
straight, one even explaining Panini and the Astadhyayi.  The correspondent
"Z" makes an unassailable truth claim by asserting "I am arabic."

The conclusion we must draw is that tatoo parlours badly need more
Indologists.  And Arabists, and Egyptologists.
