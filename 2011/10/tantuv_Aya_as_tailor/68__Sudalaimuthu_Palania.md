According to K. V. Subrahmanya Aiyar (Travancore Archaeological Series vol. 4, p.109), in the Sanskrit work Bālarāma Bhāratam, the author Bālarāmavarman Kulaśekhara-Perumāḷ uses the word 'tantuvāya' in the sense of 'tailor'. (See attachment). Has the word 'tantuvāya' been used in the meaning of 'tailor' anywhere else in Sanskrit? 

A related question is: what is the etymology of Skt. tunnavāya?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Palaniappan
