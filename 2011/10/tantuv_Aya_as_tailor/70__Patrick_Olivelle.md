Dominic is absolutely right. See tunnavāya also at Arthaśāstra 4.1.8, which clearly means weaver; and tunnavāya, compared to wahermen/dyers, at 4.1.25.

Subrahmanya Aiyar (Travancore Archaeological Series vol. 4, p.109), in the Sanskrit work Bālarāma Bhāratam, the author Bālarāmavarman Kulaśekhara-Perumāḷ uses the word 'tantuvāya' in the sense of 'tailor'. (See attachment). Has the word 'tantuvāya' been used in the meaning of 'tailor' anywhere else in Sanskrit?
