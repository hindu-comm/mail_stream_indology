Dear all,

The email address on BORI's website <http://www.bori.ac.in/contact.html>,
bori1 at vsnl.net, doesn't work.

Similarly, most parts of the website of the Oriental Institute in Baroda
<http://www.msubaroda.ac.in/oriental/>do not function.  Nor does the email
for its director, Professor Wadekar, mlwadekar at hotmail.com.

Does anyone have confirmed, recent contact email details for these two
august institutions?

Thanks,
Dominik
