Dear Artur,

A shish-kabob is pieces of meat on a skewer, intended for the grill.
Valmiki, the presumptive author of the Ramayana? 
Perhaps the cultural barrier is about making silly jokes rather than anything else.

Best wishes,
Joanna

Dear Joanna,

I guess there must be a cultural barrier at work here. I don't seem to understand your comment, not with Valmiki cast in the role of a shish-kebab inventor.

Regards,

Artur K.
