Yes, rishi Vishwamitra.

But I find the combination of the picture and the text below much more
interesting, culture-wise.

While celebrating the divine Vivaha,

<<Let us take higher.
Eden Hashish Centre
Oldest &  Fovourite Shop in Town Serving you the Best Nepalese Hash & Ganja
(Available Wholesale & Retail)
Come Visit Us Any Time For All Your Hashish Needs>>

We shouldn't talk about "multiple Ramayanas", but we can, it seems,
freely link the Ramayana tradition to the local narco-business(es).

Regards,

Artur
