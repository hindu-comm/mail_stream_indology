You will find an overview in Jacques Waardenburg: Classical approaches to the study of religion : aims, methods and theories of research. Vol. 2: Bibliography. The Hague, Paris : Mouton, 1974, pp. 184 seqq. (compare URL: <http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya9b6dOEPT4C&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA184#v=onepage>)

Waardenburg refers to two older bibliographies: one by Winternitz (1893) and another one by Michael Johan de Goeje, in an obituary published in 1902. 

If you do not already know it: Nirad C. Chaudhuri: Scholar extraordinary : the life of Professor the Rt. Hon. Friedrich Max Müller, P. C. / by Nirad C. Chaudhuri. - London : Chatto & Windus, 1974 (an Indian edition came out in 1974 by Orient Paperbacks, reprinted in 1996) contains a small bibliography on p. 385 seq.

Hope it helps
