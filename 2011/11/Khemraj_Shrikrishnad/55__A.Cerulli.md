Dear Colleagues,
I am trying to check on permissions for an image (a black & white drawing)
I'd like to reprint that came out in an edition of the Caraka Samhita with Shri
Venkateshwar Press in 1898.


I wrote to the press using an online contact form at the Khemraj
Shrikrishnadass website, but received no response.
Does anyone on the list have a contact at this press who might be able to
help me?


Also, re copyright laws, does anyone know if after a certain number of
years an image in a book becomes part of the public domain?



Thanks in advance for your assistance.



All the best,

Anthony Cerulli
