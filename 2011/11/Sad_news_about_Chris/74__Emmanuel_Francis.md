Dear list members,

I have the sad duty to let you know that Christian Bouy has passed
away on November 3.
His funeral took place today November 8 in Paris.

Christian Bouy was Maître de conférences d'études indiennes at the
Collège de France and a specialist in Indian philosophy.
He was well known to the users of the Bibliothèques d'Extrême-Orient
at the Collège de France, where he supervised the cataloguing of the
collections of the Institut d'études indiennes.

His CV and list of publications are available at
