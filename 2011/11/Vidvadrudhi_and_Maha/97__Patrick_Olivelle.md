rūḍhi is, of course, the conventional meaning of a word, such as Brāhaṇa being a group of people or caste. yoga is viewed as the etymological meaning: such as, brahmavid brāhmaṇaḥ. What the first terms of the compounds are, I am not sure. vidvadrūḍhi could mean conventional meaning among the learned.

While commenting on VT's ma;ngala;sloka, Raamaacaarya uses two technical terms which I haven't been able to find a good interpretation for. They are "vidvadruu.dhi" and "mahaayoga". I assume that these are technical terms of grammar, but I am not should what the precise distinction is between them. I would be grateful if anyone could clarify.
