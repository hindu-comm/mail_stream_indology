Dear Colleagues

A very talented 3rd year Sanskrit student, Andrew Ritchie, has created this wonderful mock Greek drama or 'satyr play' to provide a humorous 'back-story' to Kālidāsa's Abhijñānaśākuntalam.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. I am sure Andrew would appreciate receiving your feedback:
