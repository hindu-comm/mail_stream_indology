I have been trying to access the electronic Vedic concordance
(http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/VedicConcordance/ReadmeEng.html).
 This link takes me to a page that has the bold face statement:
"Access Forbidden."  Is there another way to get to this (does it
still exist?)

Or, perhaps it senses I am not a vaidika?

Thanks for any direction on this...
