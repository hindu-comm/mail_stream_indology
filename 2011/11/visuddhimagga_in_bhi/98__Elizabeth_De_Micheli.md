Dear All,

a piece of information that may be of interest to yourselves and your students:

Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga - The Path of Purification: The Classic Manual of Buddhist Doctrine and Meditation, translated by Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (4th edition) is available for free dowload here:

www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/PathofPurification2011.pdf

And btw the site's 'file not found' page is quite fun:

best wishes

Elizabeth De Michelis
