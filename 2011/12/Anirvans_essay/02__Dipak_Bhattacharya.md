If this Anirvan is the same as the recluse of Calcutta who died in the eighties, Professor Gauri Dharmapal might be contacted. She has all the publications of Anirvan with her family.

Dear Colleagues,

A student of mine that is looking at the concept of buddhi in a variety of contexts is having difficulty in obtaining the following publication. Even inter-library loan has let him down. The reference is (though it looks a little odd, I give it as he sent it to me):

Anirvan, Buddhyoga of the Gita and other Essays. New Delhi: Biblio Impex Privat 1981.

Can anyone help?

With Thanks and Best Wishes,
