Dear list members,



Ive been trying to use the devanagari package together with ledmac and
ledpar to produce facing page output and it works fine for prose texts
(though I have some doubts on how many text chunks should be handled at each
Pages environment) , but when a I try to write verse ---either with the
\stanza or {astanza} environments---, it doesnt work. Could anyone give me
a hand on that?

Best wishes
