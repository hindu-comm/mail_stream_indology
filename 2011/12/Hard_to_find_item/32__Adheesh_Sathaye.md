Hello James,

It seems that he's missing an "i" in the title which might account for the difficulty. It should be "Buddhiyoga of the Gita..."

a search on worldcat reveals the following:

http://www.worldcat.org/title/buddhiyoga-of-the-gita-and-other-essays/oclc/670102526?referer=br&ht=edition

Looks like it's available in the BL.

good luck! 

cheers,

Adheesh
