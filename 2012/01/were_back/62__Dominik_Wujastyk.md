The INDOLOGY.info website is back again, after the blackout yesterday in
solidarity with Wikipedia and others.

And SOPA and PIPA are dead, or at least sleeping.

For full discussion, see

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act
and
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act


99% / 1% calculation:
PIPA alone provides for creating 48 new jobs specifically for enforcing the
new law.  The budget assigned for that is $47,000,000.  That's a million
dollars per job.  That is enough to endow 48 permanent professorial
positions in Indian studies.


Best,
Dominik
