Dear Arthur and List,
/
Śivadharmottara Purāṇ/a 8, 26-52 describes the different stages of the 
conception, formation and development of the embryo, up to the point 
when the /jīva /acquires consciousness and remembrance of his past 
sorrowful incarnations, pledging to put an end to such course in his 
life soon to begin through the study of /śivajñāna/! (a pledge, alas! 
soon to be forgotten because of the hellish tortures inflicted by the 
/yoniyantra /and of the agony of childbirth).

The relevant passage (28-29) apparently contemplates three main phases, 
marked by three different terms (which do not include /kaṭhina/): 
/kalala/, /arbuda /(/budbuda/ in another MS) and /peśī/.

/tac chukraṃ raktasaṁyuktam ekāhāt kalalaṃ bhavet
     pañcarātreṇa kalalam arbudākāratāṃ vrajet
arbudaṃ saptarātreṇa māṁsapeśī bhavet tataḥ
     dvisaptāhād bhavet peśī raktamāṁsacitā dṛḍhā/

Greetings from likewise snowy Milan,
