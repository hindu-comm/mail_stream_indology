I have retired and use either alanus1216 at yahoo.com or allen.w.thrasher at gmail.com. Our AOC recommended gmail but I am now worried about Google's privacy policies and wonder if I should disassociate myself from it. But for the time being use either.

Does anyone have contact information for Allen Thrasher?
