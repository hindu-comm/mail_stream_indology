Dear colleagues,
I read in BEFEO 1911, p. 267, that Ḍāmareśvara would be a name of Avalokiteśvara. This concerns a Buddhist inscription of Campā which actually seems to read rather Ḍamareśvara. Either way, I cannot confirm the idea that this would be an alias of Avalokiteśvara. Can anyone help me confirm or reject this identification? 
Thank you. Best wishesm
