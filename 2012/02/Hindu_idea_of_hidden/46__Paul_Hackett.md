This is a standard story found in Buddhist tantras -- the Kalacakra-tantra and Guhyasamaja-tantra being two of the more notable ones.  In these accounts, longer discourses were given in various 'heavens' or other locations of uncertain identity, while only abbreviated versions of the teachings are transmitted to the human realm.
   The stories relating such, are found in the commentarial literature to those tantras.
