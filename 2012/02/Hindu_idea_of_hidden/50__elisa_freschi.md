Just a marginal addition: a comparable idea is also found in  
Pāñcarātra and in Viśiṣṭādvaita, when it is claimed that there  
used to be a single original Veda (ekāyanaveda), of which we only  
possess fragments. Some texts claim to be fragments of this  
ekāyanaveda and the whole theory probably aims at claiming a Vedic  
status for the Pāñcarātra (Marzenna Czerniak-Drożdżowicz spoke  
about the ekāyanaveda in the last WSC).
The ekāyanaveda-theory  is sometimes found in connection with the  
Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā claim that beside the Veda we know there is  
another Veda which is nityānumeya (always only inferable [through  
other works which are too good not to be rooted in the Veda]). Since  
this is only inferable, it does not exist as such in heaven or in any  
other "world".

Best,
