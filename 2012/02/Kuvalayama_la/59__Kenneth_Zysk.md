I should like to enquire if someone has a copy of the edition of the Kuvalayamālā by Uddyotana-suuri, i.e,  vol. 1 of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhava edition from 1959. I should greatly appreciate it if I could be directed to a website where it can be download, or if some could provide me with a pdf. version.
Many thanks,
Ken
