Dear List Members,

Has anyone by chance access to a pdf of Nick Sutton's "Asoka and
Yudhishthira: A Historical Setting for the Ideological Tensions of the
Mahabharata?" (Religion/Academic Press, vol 27, no.4, pp. 333-341,
October 1997)?

I would be very grateful for the possibility to get acquainted with it.

Artur Karp
