Dear Johanna,

While still residing in the womb (/garbhastha/) the embryo is said to be 
pressed by the /chorion/ like one squeezed down by mountains; soaked by 
the amniotic fluid like one fallen into the sea; “cooked” by digestive 
fire like one thrown into a hot brass pot; and experiencing eight times 
as much suffering as one pierced by red-hot needles. The suffering 
inflicted by the dreadful contraption of the vagina (/yoniyantra/) at 
deliverance is, however, 10 million times as much as that experienced in 
the womb. The /dehin/ who has finally “thickened” (/sammūrchita/!) and 
is ready to be born is thoroughly crushed like a cane by a grinder, his 
head pounded by a nasty hammer while he is helplessly blown out by the 
powerful winds of childbirth. Crushed by the /yoniyantra/, the newborn 
body is as sapless as a sugar cane driven through a grinder. Then the 
text goes on to expatiate on the impurity of the bodily frame by 
detailing its filthy components.

As a consequence of the agony of childbirth the newborn baby is seized 
by a violent fever which erases the memory of past lives and the 
embryo’s former resolve to attain liberation through /śivajñāna./ It is 
indeed as a remedy for such forgetfulness that the present /śāstra 
/(i.e. the /Śivadharmottara/) has been proclaimed by Śiva, in order to 
denounce the evils of /saṁsāra/ and make for heaven or liberation.

All this surely stands in stark contrast to Western psychoanalytic views 
of a prenatal “paradise lost”! What about East Asian views?
