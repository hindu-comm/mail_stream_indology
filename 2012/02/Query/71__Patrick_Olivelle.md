Dear All:

A colleague who is not on Indology asked me this question. I wonder whether the paṇḍitas out there would be able to identify a source for the verse. 

Patrick

>> A verse that comes in a number of Buddhist rakṣā texts, svastivākya, and inscriptions is:
>> 
>>> sarva satvāḥ sarve prāṇāḥ sarve bhūtāśca kevalāḥ
>>> sarve vai sukhinaḥ santu sarve santu nirāmayaḥ
>>> sarve bhadrāṇi paśyantu mā kaścid pāpam āgamat
>> 
>> 
>> 
>> This verse in modified forms appear to be found in the Hindu tradition as well. Someone has given these verses from a prayer/blessing
>> 
>> 
>> Om sarvesham swastir bhavatu
>> Sarvesham shantir bhavatu
>> 
>> Sarvesham poornam bhavatu
>> Sarvesham mangalam bhavatu
>> 
>> Sarve bhavantu sukhinah
>> Sarve santu niramayah
>> 
>> Sarve bhadraani pashyantu
>> Maakaschid-duhkha bhaag bhavet
