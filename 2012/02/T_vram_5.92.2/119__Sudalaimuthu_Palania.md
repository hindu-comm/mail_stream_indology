I wonder if published Tēvāram 5.92.2  (from http://www.ifpindia.org/ecrire/upload/digital_database/Site/Digital_Tevaram/U_TEV/TM5_92.HTM) has an error.


naṭukkattuḷḷum, nakaiyuḷum, nampaṟkuk
kaṭukkak kallavaṭam _iṭuvārkaṭkuk
koṭukkak koḷka _eṉa _uraippārkaḷai
_iṭukkaṇ ceyyappeṟīr, _iṅku nīṅkumē! 


I am specifically referring to 'k' at the end of 'koṭukkak'. The traditional explanations for 'koṭukkak koḷka' do not seem satisfactory. Without the extra 'k', the meaning is far clearer. The verse would also be similar to "koṭumiṉ koḷmiṉ" as Toṇṭaraṭippoṭi says in Tirumālai 42. 


Has anybody looked into this? Are there editions that do not have this extra 'k'?


Thanks in advance.


Regards,
Palaniappan
