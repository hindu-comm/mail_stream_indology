Dear List,

A few minutes ago I sent a private message to Dean making the same
recommendation. I sent it to Dean alone because I added a few private,
personal, notes to him, as well as a brief review of Staal's book that
I had written for JAOS.  I think that we still are unable to send
attachments to the list, right?
