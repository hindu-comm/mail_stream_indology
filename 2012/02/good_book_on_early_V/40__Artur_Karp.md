Dear List,

I'd definitely recommend Prof. Upinder Singh's "A History of Ancient
and Early Medieval India. From the Stone Age to the 12th Century",
Pearson-Longman, 2009. Chapter V:Cultural Transitions: Images from
Texts and Archaeology, c. 2000-600 BCE, pp. 182-255 (Chapter outline:
Perspectives from texts; Archaeological profiles of different regions
of the subcontinent, c. 2000-500 BCE; The problem of correlating
literary and archaeological evidence; Conclusions).

Also:

S. W. Jamison and M. Witzel, Vedic Hinduism, 1992. Text available on
the Net, to be had from:
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/mwbib.htm, at #95.
