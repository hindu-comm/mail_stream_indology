Dear colleagues




This verse was recited in kathā performance in Mumbai in 2009:





saṁsāra-sāgare magnaṁ dīnaṁ māṁ karuṇanidhe



karma-moha-gṛhītāṅgaṁ mām uddhara bhavārṇvāt




It was said to be from the Bhāgavatapurāṇa, but I have been unable to locate it in that work. I am wondering if any scholar recognises it from another source, or is it perhaps part of an oral tradition.




Thanks in advance




McComas Taylor
