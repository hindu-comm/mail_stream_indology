Dear All, 

I just received the sad news that my old friend, the famous Indologist Frits Staal, has passed away peacefully, today Sunday 2/19/12, at his home in Chiangmai, Thailand. 

His niece, Karin Staal, is visiting him from Holland and reported the sad news to us. He will be missed by many. Luckily, some of us saw him last at the great Atiratra Agnicayana at Panjal in Kerala, April 2011, which he first recorded in 1975 and published in 1983 ("Agni"). 

Michael
