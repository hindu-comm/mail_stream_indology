Dear Colleagues,



** The Mangalam Research Center for Buddhist Languages, in Berkeley, will
be offering two language intensives this summer, one in classical
Sanskritand one in literary Tibetan. Both intensives run for seven
weeks, from June
11-July 27. Each intensive program is the equivalent of a first-year
undergraduate course, and will prepare students to enroll in second-year
language courses.  Each course meets 4 hours a day, 5 days a week.



The Sanskrit course will be taught by David Mellins, Ph.D., and the Tibetan
course will be taught by Alberto Todeschini, Ph.D. Dr. Siglinde Dietz,
visiting scholar in residence at MRC this summer, will oversee both
programs.



Application forms and information about costs, housing options, etc. are
available at www.mangalamresearch.org. Please note that the application
deadlines have been extended to April 9, 2012. notification of acceptance
will be sent out by April 23, 2012.


Apologies for cross-postings.



Jack Petranker, Director
Mangalam Research Center for Buddhist Languages
