If you want your audience to see the fonts or layout of something you write, you have to send a bitmap or PDF (with embedded fonts). There are many screen-capture or screen snapshot programs that make this quite easy. Otherwise, if you just write an email and send it, target machines will likely as not interpret and change what you send, adapting the text to their locally available fonts, etc.
