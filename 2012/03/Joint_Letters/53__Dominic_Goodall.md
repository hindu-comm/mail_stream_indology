Dear all,

A few attestations of kūṭa, kūṭākṣara, kūṭabīja are mentioned in volume 2 of the Tāntrikābhidhānakośa.

Another term that has not been mentioned in this discussion is piṇḍa/piṇḍākṣara.  This too is an old tantric usage, but it is not restricted to tantric literature, for we find it also in Vāmana’s Kāvyālaṅkārasūtra (4.1.7) and in some anonymous verses he quotes in his auto-commentary.  Now the word piṇḍa clearly does refer to things having being lumped together, and so such usages suggest that the same idea of “heaping or lumping together" might indeed be at the root of kūṭa, kūṭākṣara, etc.

Today, the expression most commonly heard is perhaps saṃyuktākṣara, which may sound as though it might have been a calque upon “conjunct letters" or the like, but it is in fact some centuries old (it is used, for instance, in the Kāmadhenu commentary on the Kāvyālaṅkārasūtra).

The reason I am asking this is this. The the word for a conjunct letter in Tamil is kUTTezuttu which according to Tamil Lexicon is:

Is this terminology especially likely to be used when the consonants are many  in number (say, more than three) and are hard or virtually impossible to pronounce?
