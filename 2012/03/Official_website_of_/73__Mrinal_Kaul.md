I am happy to be able to share with all of you that the Department of Libraries and Research of the Government of Jammu & Kashmir has launched a comprehensive website listing all their activities and functions. What is important is they have also mentioned the details of the rare books and manuscript collections available with them. There is an online catalogue for the books and the catalogues of the manuscripts preserved with the Government of Jammu & Kashmir. It also says that the copies of the manuscripts are available on payment basis. I hope many of you find this information useful.
