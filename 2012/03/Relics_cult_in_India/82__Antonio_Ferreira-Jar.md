Dear Dr Karp,

It would seem that the article was revised and republished as a
monograph by Sircar in 1973 by MLBD.

According to Worldcat, a copy is available in Poland via NUKAT:
http://www.worldcat.org/title/sakta-pithas/oclc/749345928&referer=brief_results

I hope that helps.

Kind regards,

Antonio
