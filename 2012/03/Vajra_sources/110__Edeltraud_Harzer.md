Hello Jarrod,

RE: "Erwiderung auf B Schlerath: "Vedisch vajra-  'die Keule des Indra.' " 
I have the following information:
In: Orbis XXV, 1976, no 2 [1978], pp.356-358. Almost the same what you have, but 'no.2 [1978]' may be helpful to the librarians.

Rau's Metalle und MetallgerÃ¤te im vedischen Indien is on its way shortly.

Traude Harzer
