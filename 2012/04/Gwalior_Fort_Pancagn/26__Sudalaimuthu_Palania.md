Dear Indologists,


It has been reported that there is a Pancagni Tapa Paravati sculpture in Gwalior Fort temple in which Parvati is shown with a lion and blackbuck as in many DurgƒÅ sculptures in Tamil Nadu. I would appreciate very much if anybody with a picture of the same could send me a scan online or offline.


Thanks in advance.


Regards,
Palaniappan
