Dear Indologists,

Does anyone happen to know where this hero stone is now located? It used to be at the Subramanya Temple, in Mallam, AP, at least it was in 1905 when it was photographed by the ASI. I have been to Mallam, and the stone is gone. I have also looked in the Chennai Museum and the Hyderabad Archaeological Museum, without luck. 

I would be very grateful for any help!

Kindest Regards,

Mary
