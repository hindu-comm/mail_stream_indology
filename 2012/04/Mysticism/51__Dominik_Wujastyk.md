But as always with such queries (like last year's 'What's the Sanskrit for
"go with the flow"?'), one has first to ask whether there is a Sanskritic
concept that might correspond to English "mysticism."   And, most probably,
there isn't, quite.  Much interesting work has been done on
incommensurability in translation theory.
