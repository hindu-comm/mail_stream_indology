The announced volume is a collection of textual studies on various  
features of the history and culture of Kashmir. It is mainly based on  
revised versions of lectures delivered at a “Kashmir panel” held on  
the 22nd of September 2010 at the 31st German Oriental Conference  
(Deutscher Orientalistentag = DOT) in Marburg.

It deals with the transfer of India's sacred geography to the  
highlands of Kashmir in a miniaturized form (Walter Slaje), a  
previously unnoticed recording of an appearance of Halley's Comet in  
Kashmir by the poet-historian Śrīvara (Walter Slaje), the historical  
traces of vocal and instrumental music (saṅgīta) in Kashmir  
(Advaitavadini Kaul), as well as with the poetical figure bhāṣāśleṣa  
(simultaneous expression of different meanings in two or more  
languages) as a peculiarity of Kashmiri writers and critics (Michael  
Hahn). Further subjects are the formation of a specifically Kashmiri  
literary genre -- the Kashmiri kathā -- and the development of a  
special style connected to it (Luther Obrock), and the question, when,  
where and why did Bhaṭṭa Jayanta write his Nyāyamañjarī (Walter Slaje).

The last four contributions are about different aspects of the  
Mokṣopāya/Yogavāsiṣṭha literature: John Shore’s lost translation of a  
Persian version of the so-called Laghuyogavāsiṣṭha which he already  
wrote in 1784 (Jürgen Hanneder), the special character of the fourth  
book (Sthitiprakaraṇa) of the Mokṣopāya (Roland Steiner), and the  
meaning of single words (araghaṭṭa, saṃsāracakra, kośakāra) used in  
the Mokṣopāya (Martin Straube). A reply to a review of a partial  
edition of Bhāskarakaṇṭha’s Mokṣopāyaṭīkā along with general remarks  
on the “indological culture of debate” (Jürgen Hanneder and Walter  
Slaje) completes the volume.

Kind regards,
Roland Steiner
