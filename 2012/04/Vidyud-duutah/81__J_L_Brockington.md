Dear Colleagues,

I am forwarding this message and its attachment on behalf of Jayandra  
Soni, Secretary General of the IASS:


"For lovers and readers of Sanskrit, for the 5-10 minute break in  
between your tight schedule, in the hope that you will enjoy it with a  
cup of coffee or tea.

I appreciate very much, thanks to the contributors, that it could come  
out on the first of April, without being a joke!

With best wishes,
Jayendra"
