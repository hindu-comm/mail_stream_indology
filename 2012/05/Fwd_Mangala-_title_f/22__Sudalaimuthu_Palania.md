In EI 30, p. 43, n. 5. Sircar refers to an article of his entitled, "The Ambashṭha Jati" in JUPHS, vol 18, pp. 148-61. He refers to some of his observations in other references.


So far I have not come across any Tamil inscriptions mentioning ambaṣṭha in the 7th century. The early Vaidya inscriptions I have seen are from the 8th century. There is a 11th century inscription mentioning an ambhaTTan2 <sic>. I would like to see the references Sircar is referring to.

In a 1953-54 article in EI, D. C. Sircar noticed a plate that mentions Ambaṣṭhas of Tamil Nadu, and DCS suggested that they were Vaidyas

who moved from S. India to Bengal and helped to crystallize the Bengal Vaidya tradition.  There is a long history to the Ambaṣṭhas, going back to the Pāli Canon at least.  I'm not aware of a specific study of this group (and would be grateful for any reference), but they are routinely considered to be barber-surgeons, pretty much in the same mould as the European barber-surgeons.
