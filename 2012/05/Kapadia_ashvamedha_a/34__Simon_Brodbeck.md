Dear colleagues,

I wonder whether anyone is in a position to send me a PDF of the following article:

B. H. Kapadia, 'Asvamedha, the King of Sacrifices', in the Journal of the University of Bombay, vol. 30, part 2 (1961).

I would be very grateful! 

Yours faithfully,

Simon Brodbeck
Cardiff University
