It's hard to imagine a culture in which debate was so deeply ingrained and 
practiced with such relish and passion would have failed to come us with 
words for "challenge." Indeed Monier-Williams offers no less than 20.

1 abhigraha (challenge)
2 abhyāhve (challenge)
3 ākṣip (challenge)
4 ākṣepa (challenge)
5 āhve (challenge)
6 āhava (challenge)
7 āhvāna (challenge)
8 utsṛ (challenge)
9 upahūti (challenge)
10 upāhve (challenge)
11 tik (challenge)
12 pṛtanāhava (challenge)
13 pratyarth (challenge)
14 pratyākruś (challenge)
15 pravāda (challenge)
16 saṃcud (challenge)
17 samabhigarj (challenge)
18 samāhve (challenge)
19 samāhva (challenge)
20 samāhvaya (challenge)

(and search in the "english" box for "challenge"; NB. a search for 
"mysticism" yields zero hits.)

Apte's Eng-Skt Dictionary draws a blank for "challenge" -- a caution against 
relying on it for more than rudimentary suggestions. (Apte also has zero 
hits for "mysticism")

Similarly we have another word which does probably does not find a match in
Sanskrit - CHALLENGE!

what could be the sanskrit term for this ? Do we have any word even in other
Indian Languages?

shrivara
