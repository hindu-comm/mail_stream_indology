Secondary class students of Sanskrit are taught two examples
on Pāṇini 1.3.31 spardhāyām āṅaḥ‘ā hve takes the middle ending
when challenge is meant’ : Mallo mallam āhvayate ‘the wrestler
challenges (his rival) wrestler i.e. throws down the gauntlet.’ And chātraś
chātram āhvayati ‘the students calls (another) student’ So spardhā fits
the bill. Another Vedic word is śṛdhyā in yaḥ śardhate nānudadāti śṛdhyām.

Similarly we have another word which does probably does not find a match in Sanskrit - CHALLENGE!

what could be the sanskrit term for this ? Do we have any word even in other Indian Languages? 

shrivara
