Dear Dermot, Jim and members of the list,

please allow me to clear up an inaccuracy which found its way in my book, and was echoed by Jim as expressed in his email below.

As Jim points out, I stated that Vivekananda played a pioneering role in defining rājayoga
asYogasūtra-type meditative practice as opposed to
other forms of yoga,and especially haṭha. Georg Feuerstein correctly pointed out in a
review of my book(http://www.traditionalyogastudies.com/reviews_yoga_modern-yoga.html)that such a distinction, and in the same terms, is
already made byVijñānabhikṣu in his Yogasārasaṃgraha (which as many of you will know is a work attempting to summarise and and explain the Yogasūtra and Vyāsabhāsya). The translationof that passage (:55 in English; : 39 in Sanskrit in the same book) goes:

"We do not enter into the details of Postures,
because our subjectmatter is _Raja-Yoga_ (in which postures occupy only a
secondaryposition). For a full treatment of all forms of
postures and thepurification of the veins and arteries we refer the
reader to works on_Hatha-Yoga_. Postures have been described."

Here are the full biblio details of the book from the
Bodleian Library(Oxford) records:

I plan to correct the above, and integrate the latest research on the this and related topics (such as Jim's and Jason's) in a second edition of my _History of Modern Yoga_ which is under discussion with the publishers.

With all good wishes,

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Rajayoga

Dear Dermot and other members of the list,

As Prof. Slaje points out, my colleague Jason Birch's recent article is a fine survey of the use of the word haṭha in the context of yoga. Since haṭha is almost always found in conjunction with rāja yoga, Jason's article discusses rājayoga too.

The compound rājayoga suffers from the ambiguity inherent in the word yoga itself: it can mean both the practice of yoga and the goal. In the majority of its occurrences in haṭhayogic literature (which is, I think, the only type of Sanskrit literature in which it is found) it means simply samādhi. Occasionally it does refer to a specific type of yoga practice. In these instances it is meant to denote the best variety of yoga and so its use is comparable to that made popular by Vivekananda et al. - "my yoga is better than yours". (By the way, according to my notes - I don't have the books with me - Singleton 2008:84, referencing de Michelis 2004, writes that it was probably M.N.Dvivedi in a Yogasūtra translation of 1890 who first popularised the equation of rājayoga with Pātañjalayoga.) Thus in the Amanaska, which Jason is editing, it refers to a technique said to bring about the no-mind state. But in the Haṃsavilāsa, for example, rājayoga is
 a practice that involves ritual sex (and is said to be much better than haṭhayoga, which Haṃsamiṭṭhu, like many other medieval/early modern authors, sees as including Patañjali's yoga).

The Yogatattvopaniṣad (c.17th-century) passage you cite is taken directly from the Dattātreyayogaśāstra (c. 13th-century), as is most of the rest of the YTU.

Re the mahīpālavidhi: since the first attestation of the compound rājayoga (of which I am aware) is not for another thousand years or so, it seems unlikely that there is a connection between the two. The one nirukti of rājayoga of which I am aware (but Jason may know of others) does not understand it as meaning "the yoga of kings": rājatvāt sarvayogānāṃ rājayoga iti smṛtaḥ | rājānaṃ dīpyamānaṃ taṃ paramātmānam avyayaṃ | dehinaṃ prāpayed yas tu rājayogaḥ sa ucyate (Amanaskayoga 2.4).

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim
