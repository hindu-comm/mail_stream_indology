Dear Colleague,
Vidyāpati
of Mithila – Vaiṣṇava devotional poems
If kāvya
is meant then one may count 
Bāṇabhaṭṭa – Kādambarī and Harṣacarita-- prose romance, Viśākhadatta – Mudrārākṣasa -- drama. Eastern UP is culturally akin
to Bihar. This region too produced poets like Vatsabhṭṭi. 

Best
DB

Subject: [INDOLOGY] poets from Bihar?


Dear list,
Is anybody aware of Sanskrit poets from the area that is now Bihar? I imagine there may have been some well known poets from Pataliputra whose works have survived, and perhaps from other places and periods too.
I would be grateful for any leads or ideas.
Thank you
Venetia
