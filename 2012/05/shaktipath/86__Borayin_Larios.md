Dear Patrick, 

Christopher Wallis has written his dissertation on the topic and is widely available on internet. The title is: Shaktipat The Descent Of Power In Kashmir
He also wrote this article which is available through Springer: http://www.springerlink.com/content/233g5j8143147314/
I am sure there is more, but this is a start. 

Best, 
B.M. Larios
