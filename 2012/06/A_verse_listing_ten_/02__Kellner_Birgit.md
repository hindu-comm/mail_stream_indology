Dear colleagues, 

this is a question for the Vaiyākaraṇas. In his Vyākhyāyukti, Vasubandhu cites a verse which lists ten instances where the present tense is used - and these all might be instances where the present tense is used for something past. The text is only preserved in Tibetan translation, and I was wondering whether anyone knows where the list might be from. It is followed by examples for each of these uses. My understanding of the ten uses is: 

(1) Incompletion, (2) proximity to the present, (3) capability, (4) continuity, (5) disposition, (6) general state of affairs, (7) repetition, (8) becoming, (9) desire, (10) perfection. 

The Tibetan reads: 

ma zin ñid daṅ ñe ba ñid /
/ nus daṅ rgyun mi 'chad ñid daṅ /
/ de ṅaṅ (corr. : daṅ) chos ñid yaṅ daṅ yaṅ /
/ srid daṅ 'dod rdzogs rnams la 'byuṅ /

Help would be greatly appreciated, 

all the best, 

Birgit Kellner
