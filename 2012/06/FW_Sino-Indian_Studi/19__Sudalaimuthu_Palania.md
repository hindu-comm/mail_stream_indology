Dear Arlo,

On page 83 of the article, the name of the king is Śrī Māra. Has not somebody already noted the connection between this name and the name Māṟaṉ of Tamil Pāṇṭiya dynasty? (I am unable to recall the reference.) A Pāṇṭiya king Muṭa-t-Tiru Māṟaṉ has authored two Classical Tamil poems. The Sanskrit form of Tiru Māṟaṉ will be Śrī Māra. The name of a a later Pāṇṭiya king was Śrī Māra Śrīvallabhaṉ. 

According to R. C. Majumdar (Study of Sanskrit in South-East Asia, p. 25), a Sanskrit inscription was discovered in a place called Vat Luong Kau dated to be of the second half of 5th century AD. "It begins with an invocation to Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva and then refers to the great king (maharājādhirāja) ŚrI Devānīka and compares him with Yudhiṣṭhira, Indra, DhanaJjaya, Indradyumna, Śibi, Mahāpuruṣa, Kanakapāṇḍya(?), the great Ocean and Meru."

Has the possible Pāṇṭiya connection to Southeast Asia been explored by scholars after K. K. Sarkar?

Thanks

Regards,
Palaniappan
