Deat Palaniappan,

Yes, the idea of a Pāṇṭiya connection of Śrī Māra has been proposed by J. Filliozat. See his article in BEFEO 55 (1969).

http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/befeo_0336-1519_1969_num_55_1_4856

I believe there have been counterarguments but I don't now remember what they were and who has adduced them.

I don't know if the specific theme of Pāṇṭiya connections with Southeast Asia has been explored exhaustively and in detail in recent decades, but occasional observations, e.g. inspired by the occurrence of a king called Pāduka Śrī Mahārāja Rājādhirāja Parameśvara Śrī Vīrākaṇḍagopāla Śrī Sundarapāṇḍyadevādhiśvara Vikramottuṅgadeva, in an East Javanese inscription of 1323 CE, are found in the works of various scholars.

Best wishes,

Sorry, there was a typo in my earlier post. Śrī Māra Śrīvallabhaṉ should actually be Śrī Māṟa Śrīvallabhaṉ.

On page 83 of the article, the name of the king is Śrī Māra. Has not somebody already noted the connection between this name and the name Māṟaṉ of Tamil Pāṇṭiya dynasty? (I am unable to recall the reference.) A Pāṇṭiya king Muṭa-t-Tiru Māṟaṉ has authored two Classical Tamil poems. The Sanskrit form of Tiru Māṟaṉ will be Śrī Māra. The name of a a later Pāṇṭiya king was Śrī Māra Śrīvallabhaṉ. 













According to R. C.
Majumdar (Study of Sanskrit in South-East Asia, p. 25), a Sanskrit inscription
was discovered in a place called Vat Luong Kau dated to be of the second half
of 5th century AD. "It begins with an invocation to Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva
and then refers to the great king (maharājādhirāja) ŚrI Devānīka and compares
him with Yudhiṣṭhira, Indra, DhanaJjaya, Indradyumna, Śibi, Mahāpuruṣa,
Kanakapāṇḍya(?), the great Ocean and Meru."




Has the possible Pāṇṭiya connection to Southeast Asia been explored by scholars after K. K. Sarkar?
Thanks
Regards,Palaniappan

I forward the pdf file which may be of interest to some others on the list, and which is mercifully light-weight.

Best wishes,
