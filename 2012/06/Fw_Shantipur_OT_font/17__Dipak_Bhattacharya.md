The email did not work with me too even after (at) was corrected to @. Something happened to this mail of mine that I am sending for the second time.

Hi Dominik,

   Does this font have some special features? If it does, may be I would like to have it as well.

Thanks, I now have a copy. Took less than 5 minutes, I think.

Amazing thing, this network of generous colleagues.

Best,
Dominik

I'm after Shantipur OT, not Shantipur 99.
