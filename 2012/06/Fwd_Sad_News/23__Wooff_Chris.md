Joseph T. O'Connell, noted scholar of world religions, passed away
suddenly on May 6th in Lenox Hill Hospital, Manhattan, surrounded by his
loving family.   Born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1940, he was educated at
Holy Cross College and Harvard University, where he specialized in the
religions of South Asia, completing his Ph.D. thesis on Caitanya Vaisnavism.
Joseph taught at St. Michael's College and the Centre for the Study of
Religion, University of Toronto from 1968-2000, and he and his wife
Kathleen, a Tagore scholar, made regular research visits to India and
Bangladesh. His distinguished academic career includes teaching appointments
at Oxford University, Visva-Bharati University, India and more recently at
the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where he has been instrumental in the
establishment of the  Dept. of World Religions and Culture for the past ten
years.
