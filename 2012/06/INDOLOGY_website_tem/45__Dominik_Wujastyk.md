 The  ISP from whom I rent space for the INDOLOGY.info
website<http://indology.info>has announced that it has to close its
servers for a few hours of
maintenance tonight.  They say they will be offline, or unreliable, during:

   - 26/06/2012 23:00:00 - 27/06/2012 02:30:00

These are Central European times.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
