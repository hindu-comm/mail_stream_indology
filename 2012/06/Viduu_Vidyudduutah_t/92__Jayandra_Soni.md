Once again it is my pleasure to flash the second issue, with many thanks
to the contributors Ram Karan Sharmajii, Juergen Hannederjii and Robert
Goldmanjii.

Hope you enjoy it again in between your tight schedule during a break with
a cup of tea or coffee.

Members of the IASS have already received this, so apologies for dual  
and plural postings.

With best wishes,
Jay
