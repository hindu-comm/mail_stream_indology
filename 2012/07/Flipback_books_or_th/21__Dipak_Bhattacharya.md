This is a serious matter like the attempt to extend copyright upon traditional herbs like neem. As is wellknown the attempt was foiled.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Flipback books or the Pothi form for Roman characters


Dear List,
In reading the article "Flipback books: new direction of dead end"
http://www.thisbloglife.com/2012/07/flipback-books-new-direction-or-dead-end/
I was astonished to hear that the Dutch publishing company "Jongbloed" (http://www.jongbloed.com/) had attached a copyright to theDwarsligger®book format (http://www.dwarsligger.com/ or http://www.dwarsligger.nl/) they pretend to have created in 2009 (see the interview of their international marketing manager athttp://laurastanfill.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/the-flipback-part-2/
or, in Dutch, of the general manager athttp://www.amboanthos.com/Uploads/pdf/090828%20boekblad%20artikel.pdf: "the greatest book-innovation after Gutenberg"), and which is known on the English speaking market as the Flipback format (Hodder
& Stoughton Publ.), or in French as "ultra- or hyper-poche" (La Martinière Publ.).
I wonder what's the difference with the Pothi form used in Indian printing since the 19th century and still in use in publishing houses like the Venkateswara Press in Mumbai (seethesmallest pocket Bhagavadgita available in
Flipback/Pothi form athttp://www.khe-shri.com/khemraj.htm). Can thisWestern (at least Dutch...)commercial capture (this is not very Christian for a Bible publisher...) of an Indian design remains without reaction?
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
