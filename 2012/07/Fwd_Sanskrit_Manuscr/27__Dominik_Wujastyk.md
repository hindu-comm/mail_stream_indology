PS

It may amuse you to know that at a talk I gave for SALG at Cambridge
in 1996<http://univie.academia.edu/DominikWujastyk/Talks/93498/Sanskrit_Manuscripts_on_the_Internet_Cambriidge_1996>,
I finished with the following words:

Can a modern library aﬀord to be left out?
What will happen if Cambridge, say, doesn’t digitize its world-class
Buddhist manuscript collection?

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
