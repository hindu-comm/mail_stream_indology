Hello Ben,

     The email address for BORI that you gave is the old/out-dated address.  Their new address is: bori at dataone.in.  I was in Pune most of June 2012 and been to BORI recently.  I think you can use this email address and direct your message to Bapat.

> Dear list,

> Does any one have experience ordering copies of manuscripts from the Bhandarkar Institute that have been microfilmed?
>
> The one time I collected manuscripts from them I went in person and had photocopies made, but I also know that some manuscripts are available on microfilm. I assume that it is possible to order copies of specific mss, but am unclear on how to go about it
>
> It has been a number of years since I was there and the people in charge have changed. I have not found the website helpful with respect to ordering copies.

> Any help as to the best way to receive copies in a relatively timely manner would be most appreciated!
