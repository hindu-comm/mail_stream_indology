Dear All:

A scholar not on our list has asked me a question to which I have no ready answer. The query is:

>> Have you seen the expression the "32 dharmas"? What are they? Some Tamil women have said to me that the making the kolam is one of the 32 dharmas. 


I have not seen a reference to this number in the literature I know. Perhaps it is from a Buddhist source. Any help would be welcome.

She also had a query about the Tamil custom of "feeding a thousand souls" -- any ideas about where this could come from?

Thank.


Patrick
