Dear friends,

I have on my hard drive a .pdf scan of H. C. Bhayani's article "The
Apabhraṃśa passages from Abhinavagupta's Tantrasāra and
Parātriṃśika-vṛtti", which runs pp. 1-18 of an issue of the journal Vidyā,
for which I lack a volume number or a year.  Could any of you provide me
with the additional bibliographic detail?

Thanks in advance,

Whitney
