Dear All,

This newly released documentary film may be of interest to those seeking materials on Aghorī sādhus:

Warning: there is some rather gruesome footage of cannibalism!

All the best,

Jim

I am only aware of some scattered notions, e.g. Axel Michaels (“Der Hinduismus”, Munich: Beck, 1998) mentions the Aghorī ascetic Pagalānanda who lived at the cremation ground close to the Paśupatināth temple in Deopatan. For Northern India, though, the situation is different: while in the accounts of the colonial administration the Aghorīs are stereotypically depicted as a public nuisance (cp. Balfour 1897, Barrow 1893, Crooke 1896, 1908), more recent research aimed at drawing a more differentiated picture. (American) Social Anthropologists worked mainly in Banaras on the tradition of Bābā Kīnārām Aghorī and its social reforms under Avadhūt Bhagvān Rām (which – at least from hearsay – had an impact on some Nepalese Aghorīs too). See e.g.

Both still deserve to be properly studied. Some more details on Kīnārām (and other Aghorī or Aughaṛ of his or of related traditions) and his literary work can be gathered from Indian publications, for example, Dharmendra Brahmacārī Śāstrīs Santmat kā Sarbhaṅg-Sampradāy (Paṭnā, 1953). Last but not least, over the last decades the Kīnārāmīs themselves have been publishing many pamphlets and books about their tradition.

To my knowledge, not much has been done on the tantric texts related to aghorasādhanā, which is only rarely referred to by the Kīnārāmīs themselves (an exception is Rāmdulār Siṃha et al. (ed.): Aghora granthāvaliḥ. Collected Works of Aghora Manuscripts. Varanasi, 1986). As I did not touch the topic for several years I might not be up to date. So if someone could provide further information on the tantric tradition on aghora I would be very thankful.

Actually, this question stemmed from a project I am pursuing in Lausanne, and which is starting to give some interesting results on the history of Vedic Ritual. I will post them on a website asap and advise the community. Thanks again.
