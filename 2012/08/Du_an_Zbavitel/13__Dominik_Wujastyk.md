Prague, Aug 7 (CTK) - Czech Indologist and translator Dusan Zbavitel died
at the age of 87 yesterday, his daughter Gita Zbavitelova has told CTK.

Zbavitel translated over 60 books and wrote one of the first textbooks of
Sanskrit.

Experts say the first Czech translation of the complete Upanishads is one
of the most outstanding works of his.

Zbavitel made it directly from the Sanskrit original and it was published
several years ago.

Dusan Zbavitel was born Kosice, east Slovakia, in 1925, and studied
Indology at Charles University in Prague.

> From 1954, he worked as a researcher of the South Asia Department of the
Prague Oriental Studies Institute and became its head in 1960.

He also taught Bengali at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University.

After 1968, he was forced to leave the post as he disagreed with the Warsaw
Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.
