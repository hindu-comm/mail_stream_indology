Could you forward this message to the Indology group? -- Thanks, Suresh.

*Prof. BhK is no more.*

Sad news. My mentor, guru, friend and a fatherly figure is no more. He has
been receiving treatment in the hospital for the last one month, and he
suffered a heart attack tonight (Aug 10) and breathed his last. He is 84.

Pro
f. Krishnamurti is a towering giant whose monumental contributions to the
study of Dravidian linguistics cannot be overstated. The breadth and depth
of his work, and his commitment to the study of Dravidian linguistics is
inspiration to many linguists across the world.


His spirit lives on through many of his disciples who were fortunate to
receive his teaching, guidance and friendship.

Suresh.
