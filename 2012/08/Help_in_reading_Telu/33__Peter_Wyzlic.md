Dear all,

On my desk I have a Sanskrit Mahatmya in Telugu script. The title reads:

Śrīmad-Āgneyapurāṇāntargata Tulākāverīmāhātmyam / 
Rāmānujapuram-Ānandaṇpiḷḷai-Ālaśiṅgarācāryeṇa pariṣkṛtam. (Mahatmya on 
the Tulakaveri feast, taken from the Agnipurana)

In the second part it is said that it was printed by the Sarasvati 
Bhandara Press (Tiruvavlikkeṇi-Sarasvatībhaṇḍāramudrākṣaraśālāyām 
mudritam), in the year 1874/1875 (Bhāvasaṃvatsare ...). What is puzzling 
me is the name Tiruvavlikkeṇi. Is this a place name? According to the 
India Office Library Catalogue, this work was printed in Madras. So, may 
I conclude that Tiruvavlikkeṇi is Madras/Cennai or a part of it? Please 
help me to throw some light on it.

I have put a scan of the title page under URL: <http://goo.gl/UZEYy>.

All the best
Peter Wyzlic
