Dear Peter,
This Wikipedia page suggests that it is a neighborhood in Chennai, also going by the name Triplicane and having a slightly different spelling.

> Dear all,
> 
> On my desk I have a Sanskrit Mahatmya in Telugu script. The title reads:
> 
> Śrīmad-Āgneyapurāṇāntargata Tulākāverīmāhātmyam / 
> Rāmānujapuram-Ānandaṇpiḷḷai-Ālaśiṅgarācāryeṇa pariṣkṛtam. (Mahatmya on 
> the Tulakaveri feast, taken from the Agnipurana)
> 
> In the second part it is said that it was printed by the Sarasvati 
> Bhandara Press (Tiruvavlikkeṇi-Sarasvatībhaṇḍāramudrākṣaraśālāyām 
> mudritam), in the year 1874/1875 (Bhāvasaṃvatsare ...). What is puzzling 
> me is the name Tiruvavlikkeṇi. Is this a place name? According to the 
> India Office Library Catalogue, this work was printed in Madras. So, may 
> I conclude that Tiruvavlikkeṇi is Madras/Cennai or a part of it? Please 
> help me to throw some light on it.
> 
> I have put a scan of the title page under URL: <http://goo.gl/UZEYy>.

> All the best
