There is a recent and very interesting study of Jains in Tamil literary histories by Christoph Emmrich: Journal of Indian Philosophy 39, no. 6 (2011): 599-646.  Although mostly concerned with twentieth-century histories, it discusses also precursors to them in the prefaces to nineteenth-century editions of Tamil works. 

Best wishes

Will
