Dear INDOLOGY forum colleagues,

Thank you for voting and sharing your reasoning about the best future for
the INDOLOGY forum.  It's clear by a large margin that the status quo suits
most people, so that's what I shall pursue.  There's no hurry, and our
friends at the University of Liverpool are only giving the gentlest of
advanced warnings that the day will eventually come when our forum will
need to think about beginning to explore the issue of starting to finding a
new home.  "This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end.
But it is the end of the beginning."  :-)

When that day comes, we'll continue with an email-based forum as at present.

Best wishes and thanks again,

Dominik Wujastyk
