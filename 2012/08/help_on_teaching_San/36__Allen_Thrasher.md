A young cousin who is going into graduate studies in comparative religion has asked me to teach him Sanskrit. He is a residential student at George Mason, about 40 miles away from me, so I do not imagine we will be able to get together more than once every couple of weeks. Does anyone have any experience or ideas about, first, which textbook might be most useful for teaching someone Sanskrit outside of the usual classroom format, and, second, about methodology for teaching it as it were remotely?

Any comments received with gratitude.

Allen
