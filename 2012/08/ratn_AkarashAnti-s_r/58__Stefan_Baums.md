Dear Ryan,

I checked Bandurski’s 1994 catalog of the Göttingen collection of
Sāṅkṛtyāyana’s photographs, and although it contains several of
Ratnākaraśānti’s works, this title is not among them. Could it be
listed under an alternative title? I sent you Bandurski’s indices
in separate email; the whole catalog can be had here:

   http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b15929794~S1

in the Berkeley library.

All best,
Stefan
