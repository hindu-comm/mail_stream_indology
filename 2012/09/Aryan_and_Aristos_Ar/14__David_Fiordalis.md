Dear Indologists,

I have a quick question the answer to which I don't have time to track down
myself, but I imagine someone on this list knows far better than I do.

Are the Greek terms for virtue, excellence (arete and aristos) connected
etymologically with Aryan?

Thanks so much to anyone who can shed some light on this for me.
