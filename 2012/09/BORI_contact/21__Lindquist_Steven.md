Someone (perhaps Madhav) shared this email address a few months back: bori at dataone.in

Best,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] BORI contact

Dear List,

Has anyone had success contacting BORI via email recently? Their email address <bori1 at vsnl.net<mailto:bori1 at vsnl.net>> is no longer active. I get this message: Recipient address rejected: USER IS SUSPENDED.
I know Arun Barve is the new Secretary, does he have a personal email address?

Be grateful for any suggestions,
Joydeep
