Dear Whitney,

There is so much Chinese material on yoga now that this should be no problem. Best to consult the Chinese students!
In any case, there are both Sanskrit-Chinese and Hindi-Chinese dictionaries in print that will provide that accepted
usage. 

best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Chinese transliteration of Sanskrit

Dear colleagues,

A friend has asked me whether there is a standard transliteration scheme for rendering Sanskrit into modern Chinese.  My friend does not need a properly scientific system--she is a yoga teacher working in China who is interested in transcribing some bhajans for her students' use.  Any suggestions would be much appreciated: please contact me off-list,

Best,

Whitney
