The chapter

@INCOLLECTION{golz-dati,
  author = {Karl-Heinz Golzio},
  title = {Zur Datierung des Kuṣāṇa-Königs Kaniṣka I},
  booktitle = {Bauddhasāhityastabakāvalī: Essays and Studies on Buddhist
Sansrkti
    Literature Dedicated to Claus Vogel by Colleagues, Students, and
Friends},
  year = {2008},
  pages = {79--91},
  editor = {Dragomir Dimitrov and Michael Hahn and Roland Steiner},
  publisher = {Indica et Tibetica Verlag},
  address = {Marburg},
}

was recently brought to my attention by my colleague Philipp Maas.  Golzio
surveys the early work on the problem of K's date, and also discusses the
key findings arising from the discovery of the Rabatak inscription and its
interpretation by Joe Cribb and others (incl. Sims-Williams and Salomon),
and the reinterpretation of the colophon of the Yavanajataka by Harry Falk
(Golzio refers also to the challenge to Falk's view articulated by
Bracey<http://www.kushan.org/essays/chronology/falk.htm>).
On p.89, Golzio sketches the remaining problems that surround the dating of
Vāsiṣka, that sits uncomfortably in contradiction to several sources.

Best,
Dominik
