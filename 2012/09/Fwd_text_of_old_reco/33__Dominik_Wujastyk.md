Subject: text of old recording from India
To: INDOLOGYCOMMITTEE at liverpool.ac.uk


  Dear members of the Indology list,

can anybody help me with a translation of the following text? We have an
old recording of this song here in the Phonogramm-Archiv of Vienna. It was
recorded in 1905 in Varanasi and sung by Madhusūdan Keśava Jośī. On the
protocol it is described as "Maratti-Song". But is it Marathi at all?

Best wishes,

Ulla Remmer
