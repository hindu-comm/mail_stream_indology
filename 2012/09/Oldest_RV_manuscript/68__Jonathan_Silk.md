dear Colleagues,

I was asked one of those questions which I think I *should* have been able
to answer by myself, but --am I just being lazy?-- it seems more reliable
and quicker to ask the śiṣṭas:

What is the oldest RV MS? I'm guessing (!) that it should be in śarada, and
I know that the oldest one in Pune is supposed to date to the 15th c. but I
doubt that it just happens to be the oldest overall.

Thanks in advance!  jonathan
