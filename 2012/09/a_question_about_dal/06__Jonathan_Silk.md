dear Friends,I was sent the following with a question whether it made any
sense. I am, let us say, suspicious, but since I can't categorically say
it's rubbish...


"According to James Massey, the term "Dalit" is perhaps, one of the most
ancient terms which has not only survived till date, but is also shared by
a few of world's oldest languages, namely, Hebrew and Sanskrit. Though they
differ in their grammatical and lexicographical connotations, both these
languages share the term "Dalit" with the same root and sense. It has been
said that the root word 'dal' in dalit has been borrowed into Sanskrit from
Hebrew." (www.csichurch.com/article/dalit.htm and see
