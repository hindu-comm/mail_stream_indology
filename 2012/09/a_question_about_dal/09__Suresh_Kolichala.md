Does that mean another assertion of James Massey that the first person
to use 'dalit' in the modern sense was Jotirao Phule of the 19th
century is also incorrect?

"The present usage of the term dalit goes back to the nineteenth
century, when a Marathi social reformer and revolutionary Mahatma
Jotirao Phule used it to describe the outcastes and untouchables as
the oppressed and broken [...]" (Massey 1991:9, Roots, a concise
history of Dalits)
