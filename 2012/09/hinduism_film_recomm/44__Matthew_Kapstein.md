Dear Vanessa,

Thank you for the fine idea of compiling a list of documentaries on Hinduism. Here are
a few starters:

Dans les brumes de Majuli
about the monastic communities in Assam founded by the 15th c. bhakti teacher Sankaradeva
is excellent, though I don't know if an English version is yet available.

Between the Lines
is a superb documentary on the hijras (transvestites and eunuchs) of the Bombay area,
with some very good coverage of the religious aspects of their world

Staal's Altar of Fire, now almost 40 years old, may still be recommended to introduce
aspects of Brahmanical traditions.

I look forward to seeing others' suggestions.

Matthew
