Colleagues,

One of my favorites, though now a tad dated, is the BBC film "The Fourth Stage," which documents the deliberations of a retired Deccan Herald editor as he tries to decide whether he should follow a family tradition and take samnyasa in his old age.  Included is his pilgrimage to Srngeri (where he has an interview the Sankaracarya) and Banaras (where he observes a ritual initiation into samnyasa), as well as a fascinating discussion with his family ("We're all against your idea!).  Now available on DVD. See:

Regards,

Lance
