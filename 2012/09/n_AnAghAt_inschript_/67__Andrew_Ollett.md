This inscription is no. 3 (pp. 5-16) in Mirashi's book (which Richard
Salomon referred to). He accepts Bühler's dating. Mirashi rejects the
argument that Suresh Kolichala referred to (about the Nāṇeghāṭ inscription
being paleographically later than the Besnagar pillar inscription of
Heliodorus) on p. 5 of part I ("Palaeographic evidence is not quite
reliable when the distance in time is not large").

I happen to have Ajay Mitra Shastri's "Age of the Sātavāhanas" here, and in
his article (p. 24-25) he suggests that the Nāṇeghāṭ inscription was put up
by Vediśrī during or after the reign of his father Sātakarṇi I (whom
Shastri dates to 12BC-AD44).
