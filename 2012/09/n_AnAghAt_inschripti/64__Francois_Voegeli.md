Dear Members of the List,

In 1883, Bühler edited and translated an inscription found in the Nānāghāt cave (Andhra Pradesh) in the Archaeological Survey of Western India, Vol. V, pp. 59–74.
On the basis of epigraphic evidence, Bühler concluded that this inscription was incised between 200 and 150 BC (op. cit. p. 73).
Has this dating been challenged since?
Also, has any secondary literature on this inscription been produced after Bühler's paper and where can I find it?

Many thanks in advance,
