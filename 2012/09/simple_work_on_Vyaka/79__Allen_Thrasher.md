I have a friend who teaches English grammar in a correspondence school. I would like to give him a notion of the glories of the Sanskrit grammatical tradition. Can someone recommend a good sketch for someone with no indological background of how Paninian grammar works, and of the tradition of grammar and philosophical grammar after him? I am thinking of something of the length of a chapter in a book or a pamphlet.

Thanks,

Allen
