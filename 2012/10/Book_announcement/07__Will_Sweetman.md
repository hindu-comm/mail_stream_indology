I'm pleased to announce the publication of a book which may be of interest to some members of the list.

The book, written together with R. Ilakkuvan, is a study of the library of Tamil manuscripts collected by Bartholom√§us Ziegenbalg, a Lutheran missionary in South India from 1706-1719. Further details are available here: http://www.ifpindia.org/Bibliotheca-Malabarica-Bartholomaus-Ziegenbalg-s-Tamil-Library.html

Best wishes

Will Sweetman
