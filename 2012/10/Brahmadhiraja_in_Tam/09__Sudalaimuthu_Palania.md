Dear Indologists,


I need the following article. 


"Brahmādhirāja in Tamil Nādu," by J. Sundaram in Sankaram: Recent Researches on Indian Culture (Professor Srinivasa Sankaranarayan Festschrift) edited by S. S. Ramachandra Murthy, B. Rajendra Prasad, and D. Kiran Kranth Choudary, Harman Publishing House, New Delhi, 2000, pp. 110-120.


I would really appreciate if anyone could email me the article offline.


Thanks in advance


Regards,
Palaniappan
