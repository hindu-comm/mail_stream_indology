Dear Colleagues,



Are any of you aware of works that take up commentators on the Vishnu
Purana?



I have been asked about commentaries on this text by a student and am
embarrassingly ignorant!



Should anyone have any texts of these commentaries (or references for them,
if printed editions exist), I would also be grateful.



The student reads Sanskrit well.



Thanks in Anticipation,



James Hegarty
