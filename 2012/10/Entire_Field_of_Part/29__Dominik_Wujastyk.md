My colleague and friend Thomas Kintaert brought this report to my attention
just now:
Entire Field of Particle Physics Is Set to Switch to Open-Access Publishing

A consortium has brokered an agreement with 12 journals to ensure that
nearly all particle physics articles are made immediately free on journal
Web sites

 By Richard Van
Noorden<http://www.scientificamerican.com/author.cfm?id=3221>and
Nature
magazine <http://www.scientificamerican.com/author.cfm?id=3044>

This is a very interesting and important development, and one that we
Indologists could consider emulating.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
