In the description
of the generation of sound, Pāṇinīyaśikṣā vss 6cd and 7ab state:
‘The mind hits the bodily fire, that sends the (bodily)
wind (=breath), the breath roaming in the breast generates
a charming svara.’ 
The place of the wind ie breast seems to indicate that
life-breath that is Prāṇa is meant. Not
itself svara it is held responsible for its generation.

Respected Scholars,

Iam looking for the earliest textualreferencesof"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e "praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for itin particular intantra literature.

Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
