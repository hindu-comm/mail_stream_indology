Thank you Sir very much for your valuable information. Wefind inYogic texts, Svara is used in term of praa.na. 

As you would know, there is a text availableknown as"svarodaya". I wonder why it iscalled svarodaya"saastra, why notpraa.nodaya.

As per avaialble materials we find in its colophon: iti umaamahe"svarasa.mbaade svarodayaj~naana.m sa.mpuur.nam. AfterI closely wentthrough available aagamas and puraa.nas Icould notfind its source text. I would be grateful forfurtherinformation and help on this subject.


Once again thanks to all of you for your valuable informations.

with Best Regards,

In the description of the generation of sound, Pāṇinīyaśikṣā vss 6cd and 7ab state:
‘The mind hits the bodily fire, that sends the (bodily) wind (=breath), the breath roaming in the breast generates a charming svara.’ 
The place of the wind ie breast seems to indicate that life-breath that is Prāṇa is meant. Not itself svara it is held responsible for its generation.

Respected Scholars,

Iam looking for the earliest textualreferencesof"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e "praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for itin particular intantra literature.

Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
