Dear All,

I use Mac and I've started to work with La Tex for the purpose of noting variants in texts.  I find La Tex a bit non-user-friendly, and I'm wondering if someone could recommend a good website for Indologist, Sinologist, etc. who are making critical editions, or (preferably) if anyone knows a better program that will allow for multiple footnote bars, margin notes, etc.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
