Dear List,

Does anyone have access to this paper: David M. Knipe*,* *The Vocation of
Vedam, the Selection of Srautam: Vedic Brahmans in Coastal Andhra.* The
paper was presented at the Meeting of the Asian Studies Association in
Chicago in 1997.

If anyone could provide me with a PDF or tell me where I can get it, I
would highly appreciate it.

Thank you!
