I wanted to respond to this posting earlier, but got tied up with  
other things. I'm glad George stepped in.


The usage "maṅkala makaḷir" in puṟanāṉūṟu 332 has a  
parallel in cilappatikāram where mātavi is referred to as a  
"maṅkala maṭantai" when she and kōvalaṉ give away a great deal  
of gold on the occasion of celebrating the birth of maṇimēkalai. It  
is not clear what the author meant -- mātavi was a participant in a  
charitable activity (which was also 'auspicious' considering the  
occasion of childbirth)? or, the cilappatikāram supports the view  
that the attribute "maṅkala" has some connection with courtesan(s).


Other contexts/phrases to consider from early texts: vāḷ  
maṅkalam, kuṭai maṅkalam, ēr maṅkalam, nāḷ maṅkalam,  
maṇṇu maṅkalam, and so on.


However, the tirukkuṟaḷ uses the term maṅkalam differently:  
"maṅkalam eṉpa maṉai-māṭci ..."


There seems to be a semantic shift in the usage of the term under  
consideration.

Regards,
Rajam
