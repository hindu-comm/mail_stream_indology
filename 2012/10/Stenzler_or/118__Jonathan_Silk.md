dear Colleagues,

I have a colleague who is a classicist, whom I may be convincing it would
be great to study Sanskrit. I'm not sure what would be the best book to use
for someone who is entirely at home in Greek (and Latin) but doesn't know
an Indic language. I thought of Stenzler, but then, which edition? Or is
there a better choice? It may be disloyal given where I teach, but I
consider Gonda to be impossible as anything other than a list of forms...

thanks so much in advance for the advice, jonathan
