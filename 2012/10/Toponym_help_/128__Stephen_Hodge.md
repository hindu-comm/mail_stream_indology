Dear Colleagues,
        In the the alchemical text, the Rasārṇava, there are the following lines, mentioning several toponyns. I presume the author is alluding to real places, so if anybody can help with identifying the locations etc of the places mentioned, I would find it very helpful for a long-standing puzzle arising from other research.

asti martye mahāpuṇyā pavitrā dakṣiṇā-pathe |
nadī godāvarī nāma prasiddhā jāhnavī yathā || Ras 12.236 ||
dakṣiṇe ca taṭe tasyāḥ kadalī-nagaraṃ param |
tasya dakṣiṇataḥ śailaḥ sarva-lokeṣu viśrutaḥ || Ras 12.237 ||
nāmnā kṛṣṇa-giriś ceti dṛśyate sarva-maṅgale |
suprasiddhâmbikā nāma grāmas tasyāsti saṃnidhau || Ras 12.238 ||

These are the places I need suggestions / help with:

kadalī-nagaraṃ (of course, not the Kadali near the Andhra coast, just north of the Godāvarī delta)
kṛṣṇa-giriḥ
ambikā

Best wishes,
Stephen Hodge
