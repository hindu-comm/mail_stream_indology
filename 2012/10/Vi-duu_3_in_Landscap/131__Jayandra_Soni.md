Dear List Members,

It is a pleasure to flash the next issue of Vi-duu, Vidyud-duutah, the  
E-Messenger, this time in Landscape format, with many thanks to the  
authors for writing their pieces especially for this issue.

Once again it is hoped that you can enjoy it during a short break in  
between your tight schedule, with a cup of tea or coffee.

Members of the IASS already have this, so apologies for the file in  
dual and/or plural numbers.

With best wishes,

Jayendra
