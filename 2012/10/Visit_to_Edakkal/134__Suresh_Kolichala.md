Very interesting analysis, Palaniappan. This inscription has assumed
significance as some readings claim that the language represented
early-Malayalam, and thus proving the antiquity of Malayalam. It would be
interesting to know the opinions of the distinguished epigraphists on this
list about your analysis.

I would also like to know what the scholars on this list think about the
Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions of Adichanallur and Porunthal which some believe
belong to the 6th century BCE and 5th century BCE respectively.

Regards,
Suresh.
