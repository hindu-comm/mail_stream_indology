Dear list members,

I am currently attempting to identify instances of the andhagajanyāya in
classical South Asian literature and would greatly appreciate your help.

Despite its popularity today, the maxim seems rarely attested in classical
works. So far, I have been able to identify only nine works (see below),
in which the maxim is mentioned. I would be very thankful if you could
refer me to any other instances of the maxim or to secondary literature,
in which it is discussed.

Thank you very much and

with best regards

Himal Trikha
