Dear Indologists,

I would like to trace the original source of the following Sanskrit verse 
which is said to be by Hemacandra. As you may know, it is widely quoted and 
well-known but where it originally came from remains unknown. Please let me 
know if you have any clue. 

प्रमाणसिद्धान्तविरुद्धमत्र यत्किंचिदुक्तं मतिमान्द्यदोषात् |
मात्सर्यमुत्सार्य तदार्यचित्ताः प्रसादमाधाय विशोधयन्तु ||

Many Thanks in advance,

Best wishes
Rohana Seneviratne
