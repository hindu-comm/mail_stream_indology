This is maybe not relevant, but a recent film,  "Papilio Buddha" by Jayan K. Cherian, dealing with a group of Dalits in Kerala embracing (Ambedkar neo-)Buddhism, is at the moment suffering censorship in India. See:

>> Dear colleagues,
>>  
>> A few weeks ago, I asked for film recommendations for an introduction to Hinduism course and received a flood of wonderful suggestions. As promised, I am sending you here the results of that discussion thread. I am sure many of you will find the list of recommendations useful for your own classrooms as well.
>>  
>> I mentioned in the email that a similar discussion took place on H-Buddhism a few months back and a number of you asked if you could see the list of sources that circulated as a result of that discussion. I have asked Sarah Jacoby, the scholar who offered to compile the suggestions into one file, if I could share her file with this list and she happily agreed. I am therefore attaching here for you two  documents – recommendations for Buddhism and recommendations for Hinduism. If I can figure out, I will also post these on the Indology FAQ.
>>  
>> Best wishes,
