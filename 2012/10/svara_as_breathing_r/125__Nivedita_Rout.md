Respected Scholars,

Iam looking for the earliest textualreferencesof"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e "praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for itin particular intantra literature.

Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
