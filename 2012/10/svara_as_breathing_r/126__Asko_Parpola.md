The phrases prāṇaḥ svaraḥ and prāṇo vai svaraḥ occur many times  
already in the Sāmavedic Brāhmaṇas, cf. respectively  
Pañcaviṁśa-Brāhmaṇa 7,1,10; 17,12,2; Jaiminīya-Brāhmaṇa 1,301 & 307,  
and PB 24,11,9; JB 1,123.140.164.215; 2,168; 3,194.229. However, in  
these phrases svara means 'tone' rather than breathing, see W.  
Caland's translation and comments on those text places.

With best regards and wishes, Asko Parpola
