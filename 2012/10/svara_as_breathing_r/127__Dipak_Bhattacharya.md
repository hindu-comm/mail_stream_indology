In the description
of the generation of sound, Pāṇinīyaśikṣā vss 6cd and 7ab state:
‘The mind hits the bodily fire, that sends the (bodily)
wind (=breath), the breath roaming in the breast generates
a charming svara.’ 
The place of the wind ie breast seems to indicate that
life-breath that is Prāṇa is meant. Not
itself svara it is held responsible for its generation.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] svara as breathing/respiration


Respected Scholars,

Iam looking for the earliest textualreferencesof"svara" used in term of "breathing" apart from Yogic texts. 
I find close evidences i.e "praa.na is svara" in Upanisads.Still I look for itin particular intantra literature.

Thank you all in advance for your help and suggestions!
Regards,
