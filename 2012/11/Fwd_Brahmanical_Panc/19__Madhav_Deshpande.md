Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Brahmanical Pancarohani festival?
To: "Walser, Joseph" <Joseph.Walser at tufts.edu>


Hello Joseph,

     The Pali expression paccorohanii almost certainly corresponds to
Sanskrit Pratyavarohaṇī, rather than Pañcarohani.  The verb pratyavarohati
(Ardhamagadhi: paccoruhai) is commonly found in the Brāhmaṇa texts like the
Śatapatha.  I am not so familiar with all the  ritual literature, but there
may be a ritual in the Brāhmaṇas that is referred to by this name.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
