Dear List,
In trying to enter in contact with Gwendolyn Layne a few days ago (see her "e-home" at http://members.aceweb.com/gwenlayne/index.html), I heard about her death, a year and a half ago, from her husband Clinton Seely. I got from him a cd with the .pdf of the translation of Kaadambarii plus two articles by her wife ("Kadambari, and the Art of Framing Lies: A Study in Storytelling," Jadavpur Journal of Comparative Literature, vol. 18-19, 1980-81, pp. 98-118, and "Sanskrit Fantasy Literature," in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy Literature, ed. John Clute and John Grant, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1992, pp. 814-15). He told me to be free to pass it along to any of the colleagues who might be interested in Baa.na and Layne's work. So with the help of a friend I made new "searchable" .pdfs: they are now available for download (gathered into one file  "Pour_Christophe.zip", 144769174 bytes) for 14 days. You can click on the link below to download the file: <https://transvol.sgsi.ucl.ac.be/download.php?id=8e39b4262fe13902>
With best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
