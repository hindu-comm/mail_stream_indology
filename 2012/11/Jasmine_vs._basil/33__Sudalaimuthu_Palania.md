There is a famous Namputiri brahmin household called Svarṇattu Maṉa near Kochi. It is supposed to be a 12-keṭṭu (i.e., it has three courtyards each of which is a nālu (4)-kettu). According to tradition, Ādi Śankara is supposed to have composed the Kanakadhārā Stava there. In any case, what I found interesting in the main courtyard is that it has the mullai (jasmine) plant rather than the usual tuḷaci (basil) plant. According to Mr. Narayanan Nampūtiri of that household, jasmine is considered more auspicious than basil. This reminded me of the CT usage 'mullai cāṉṟa kaṟpu' Is this a tradition specific to Kerala? Is this tradition also found in any Sanskrit literary sources?


Thanks in advance


Regards,
Palaniappan
