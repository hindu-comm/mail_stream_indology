Dear Colleagues,
I am wondering if anyone happens to have a scan handy of the following:
Katre, Sumitra Mangesh, and P. K. Gode. 1954. Introduction to Indian textual criticism. Poona: [Published by S.M. Katre for the Deccan College Post-graduate and Research Institute].
It appears to be available at my library only in the highly inconvenient 'reading room only' type of situation.  In any case, perhaps someone who has recently been to AIIS in Pune can help me out!
Thanks!!Charlie
