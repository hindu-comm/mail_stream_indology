Subject: [INDOLOGY] m-/b- alternation in Burushaski


The list may recall our discussion onNarmada and Narbada alternation, and the possible sound change where intervocaliclabialnasal transforms to become an oral stop along the following lines:-m- > -β̃- > -v/b-.

However, I was surprised to find a word-initial alternation of m and b in one of the famous papers Witzel wrote in 1999 (he was very prolific in that year). He says the following in this paper (http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/MT-Substrates.pdf):

North of this area, at the northern bend of the Indus (Baltistan/Hunza), Burushaskiis spoken. However, the language and the tribal name are indirectly attested in this generalarea ever since the RV: *m/bruža (mod. burušo) > Ved. Mūja-vant, Avestan Muža.

Is such m-/b- alternation a known Burushaski phenomenon? Witzel seems to suggest thatMruža was thethe ancient self designation of the Burusho- people but, unfortunately, without any helpful references.


I appreciate any information or pointers on such transformation.

Thanks,
Suresh.

It is interesting that Brahui, a Dravidian language now found in the southwestern corner of Pakistan, also shows a similar transformation:

*mē(l)- 'over, above' > Br. bē-
*miṭ- 'to leap'>Br.*biṭ-'to throw, let drop'

However, this change is apparently conditioned by afollowing front vowel (Dravidian nasals in Brahui, Krishnamurti 2001:121-126), and perhaps unrelated to the above alternation.
