Friends:

I have what appears to be a citation from a Buddhist work by Medhātithi, the great commentator of Manu. On Manu 2.6 (Jha's ed. p. 57) he cites: "paśyāmy ahaṃ bhikṣave divyena cakṣuṣā sugatiṃ durgatiṃ ca."

Jha reads "bhikṣūṇāṃ", but this is probably an error. I have emended it following five manuscript readings given in the Gharpure edition.

Thanks for any leads. Best,

Patrick
