Dear colleagues,

I am very grateful for the many nice messages we received. Since many among you lamented the fact that it would have been preferable to know about the conference well in advance, here is the website of the CBC project. Everyone is welcome to propose ideas, contribute to the existing projects, suggest contributors or just surf through the wiki:

The 2013 CBC  will take place in September, in Turin:
