Dear Indologists,


The online Malayalam Dictionary by Gundert at the following site does not seem to have the pages proving the key to abbreviations. 


http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/gundert/


I would appreciate very much if someone could send me offline a scan of the pages with the key.


Thanks in advance


Regards,
Palaniappan
