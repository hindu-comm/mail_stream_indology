> up the Mahabharata files donated by Prof. Varakhedi following the TEI
> Guidelines, and the e-text was published on the SARIT server yesterday.

The URL for the devanāgarī encoded version has changed (due to
slightly modified indexing behaviour):

   • http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/navigate.pl?indologica.0

The easiest way to find all SARIT texts is to hit Search with an empty
search string on http://sarit.indology.info/.
