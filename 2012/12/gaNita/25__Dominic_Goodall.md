Dear Jean-Michel,

Regarding the other question,

>> Another query : I am looking for ancient numerical inscriptions (i.e. showing figures, numbers in decimal notation), either in Indian locations or in good copies, books, articles, etc.

this article of Dominique Soutif seemed to me both very interesting and very useful :

2008 « Dénombrer les biens du dieu ; étude de la numération du khmer ancien (vie-xiie siècle çaka) », Siksâcakr 8, p. 51-80 [paru en 2010 ; traduction khmère, p. 172-206].

The first image is quite clear, but does anyone know the meaning of the second ? What exactly is intended by the "jewels of the snake" and in what other source could we find this figure ?
