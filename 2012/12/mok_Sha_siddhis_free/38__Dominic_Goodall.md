Dear colleagues,
Alex Watson has just asked me to forward this query to the list.  Any leads?
Dominic Goodall


Dear Colleagues

I remember that Tuvia Gelblum, in a talk at SOAS about the Yogasūtras, elaborated the difference between the pursuit of mokṣa and the pursuit of siddhis as a difference between a search for 'freedom from' and a search for 'freedom to'.

Has anyone seen someone in print applying this dichotomy between two kinds of freedom to the distinction between mokṣa and siddhis?

Yours Alex
