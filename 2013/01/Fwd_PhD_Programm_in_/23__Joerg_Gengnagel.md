*The Graduate Programme for Transcultural Studies welcomes applications 
for eight doctoral scholarships. The application system is now open 
until March 15, 2013.*

The programme offers a monthly scholarship of 1.200 Euro. It further 
supports scholarship holders in framing their research through advanced 
courses and individual supervision and mentoring. The scholarships start 
in the winter term 2013/14 and are granted for two years with the 
possibility of an extension for an additional year. Half of them are 
reserved for young scholars from Asia.

Applicants are expected to propose a doctoral project contributing to 
the general research framework of the Cluster of Excellence “Asia and 
Europe in a Global Context. The Dynamics of Transculturality”. They must 
hold an M.A. or equivalent in a discipline of the humanities or social 
sciences with an above-average grade. Applications, including a CV, a 
letter of intention, a project proposal, a schedule for the 
dissertation, and recommendations are accepted *until March 15, 2013, 
via the Online Application System 
<https://vjc.w2system08.de/intern/start_start_for.php>*.

After an initial evaluation and selection, applicants will be asked to 
get in contact with possible supervisors at the Cluster of Excellence to 
discuss their project proposal. The most promising applicants will be 
invited to present their projects to the selection committee in 
Heidelberg. Subsequently the scholarship holders will be selected.
