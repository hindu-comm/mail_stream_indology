Thank you Robert for this valuable information. Perhaps you could explain a bit about the type and quality of evidence we have pointing to the correct state of the mulapatha and the corrupted state of the pracalitapatha.
Many thanks,
Howard Resnick

These two traditions are linked with caste distinctions within the Mādhva community: the mūlapāṭha with the original Taulava Mādhvas (Madhva himself was a Taulava) and the pracalitapāṭha with the Deśastha Mādhvas (Jayatīrtha was a Deśastha).

The best edition of Madhva's collected writings, by Bannañje Govindācārya, is based on the mūlapāṭha (mainly on a manuscript by Hṛṣikeśatīrtha, a direct disciple of Madhva), which was printed some time in the 1970s, if I recall correctly. Govindācārya is at present working on a new edition of the Mahābhāratatātparyanirṇaya together with a new commentary (by himself) in Sanskrit.
