Dear colleagues,

	Let me bring your attention to a seminar on Sanskrit syntax and discourse structures we are organizing in Paris, June 13-15, and to a workshop on computational Sanskrit syntax to follow it, 17-21 June.  We invite interested scholars to submit presentation proposals.  Please see the details at the following link:

	Please pass the announcement on with reference to the above link privately and to relevant list-servers.

Thank you.
	Yours,
	Peter
