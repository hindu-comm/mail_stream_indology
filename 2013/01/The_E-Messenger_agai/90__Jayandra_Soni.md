To Readers and Lovers of Sanskrit,

It is a great pleasure to release the next issue of Viduu,  
Vidyud-duutah, the E-Messnger with a special stanza on the occasion of  
this the first day of the New Year. It is hoped, again, that you will  
enjoy it in your tight schedule during a tea or coffee break.

With best wishes,

Jay Soni
