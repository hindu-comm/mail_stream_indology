Richard Gombrich writes (in his Boden inaugural, "In Being Sanskritic"):
"Surviving Sanskrit literature is many times as large as Latin and Greek
literature together. There may be as many as two million manuscripts
extant..."

Is this a "standard" figure; does anyone have any other sources that
support this figure? (Or, larger or smaller figures.)

Along with this question, is there an estimate of the number of distinct
texts (not just mss.) composed in Sanskrit?

Thanks,

Herman
