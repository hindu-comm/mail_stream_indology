Dear All,

David Pingree in "Indian Astronomy" _Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society_ (Vol 122 No 6, 1978) says there is about 10,000 separate texts dealing with the exact sciences in Sanskrit, and approximately 100,000 manuscripts.  The distinction between separate texts and manuscripts seems important, and should probably factor into the evaluation.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
