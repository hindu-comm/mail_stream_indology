Dear List,
A very happy new year to all.
Has anyone come across translations which try to convey the shabdalamkara
found in a particular Sanskrit verse or poem in English (or other
languages).  Apart from the brilliant translation of the Gita Govinda by
Lee Siegel, and a few stray verses here and there, I can't think of any
others that I have read at least.
Many thanks
Venetia
