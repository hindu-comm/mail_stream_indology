Thank you to Whitney Cox and Harunaga Isaacson for 
suggesting, correctly no doubt, that visarāru is likely just an
orthographical variant for the well-attested viśarāru
meaning "perishable."

Whitney adds that the term seems to have been characteristically
used by Kashmiris, though I don't believe that Kamalaśīla was from
Kashmir.
