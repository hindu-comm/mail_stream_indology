We've started putting our course schedule on the internet in a more
accessible way than formerly:

One of the great things about the dept. in Vienna is that teachers can vary
their courses without much formality from term to term.  So topical courses
vary a lot, and change from term to term according to people's evolving
research interests.  It makes for a rich educational ecosystem.

Best,
