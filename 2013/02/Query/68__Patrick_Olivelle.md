Thanks to all who correctly identified the verse. This is cited, curiously, in a Dharmanibandha text, Devanabhaṭṭa's Smṛticandrikā (Mysore edition, Saṃskārakāṇḍa, p. 27) in support of the importance of local norms and customs with respect to dharma.

Also, do we find similar claims elsewhere, and does such advocacy ever attempt to explicitly refute or harmonize with strong, apparently countervailing, universalist claims based on 'sanatana-dharma', a broad brahminical aitihya, or other authorities?
