[Archive link](https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/2013-February/037514.html)

On behalf of the team working on SARIT, I am pleased to announce several
new additions to the archive since last year.

The current list of
texts<http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/search3t?dbname=indologica&word=&OUTPUT=conc&CONJUNCT=PHRASE&DISTANCE=3&title=&author=>is
always up to date.  Each file has a header that gives full
bibliographical details, statements of responsibility for the work, and a
change log giving a brief diary of the history of the file.

Briefly, files added in recent months include:
