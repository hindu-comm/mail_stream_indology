Dear Indologists,

A friend who is studying Sanskrit asks me if there is an audiobook 
on Sanskrit pronunciation. Can anyone recommend one?

Pronunciation varies, of course, and I've picked up mine from 
various oral and written sources. He's going to study in Kolkata, at 
Jadavpur University, but I don't think he wants to learn an exclusively 
Bengali pronunciation.
