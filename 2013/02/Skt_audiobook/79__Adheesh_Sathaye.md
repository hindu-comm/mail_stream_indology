Dear Dermot,

If one is looking for basic pronunciation of phonological elements, and some elementary vocabulary, you might find the website we have designed at UBC to be useful. The audio is of my father and involves therefore a Puneri Marathi Sanskrit pronunciation. Please see: www.ubcsanskrit.ca.

It is meant for first-year students, and is coordinated with the Goldmans' Devavani-pravesika. It is a work in progress, so we welcome all kinds of feedback! 


Best wishes,
