> KOCHI: With an aim to revive Sanskrit language, once considered the
> mother of all languages in India, the government has decided to introduce
> Sanskrit as a second language from class I from the next academic year, in
> all state syllabus schools.
>
> "We have decided to introduce Sanskrit as the second language from the
> primary section. At present, Sanskrit is taught only from class V. This
> would also create more posts for Sanskrit teachers in schools," said
> director of public instruction (DPI) A Shahjahan.
>
> At present, Sanskrit is taught in 2,975 government, aided and private
> state syllabus schools in the state from class V. There are only around
> 2,47,764 students studying Sanskrit, as compared to the 9,82,103 students
> studying Arabic which is taught to students from class I. "We have enough
> Sanskrit teachers but there are very few students who opt for Sanskrit in
> schools," Kerala Private Secondary School Headmasters Association
> secretary, PJ Jose said. There are at present 2,920 teachers teaching
> Sanskrit in these schools.
