I have not read Stietencron’s thesis. So I do not know if
he referred to the older account of the community available in Nagendra Nath
Basu’s Vanger jātīya itihās ‘Caste history of Bengal’,
Brāhmaṇakhaṇḍa (=Vol.1).
Basu has other writings on them, in English too, but these require corrections
and are not dependable.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Śākadvīpīya brahmans


I've discovered H. von Stietenkron's PhD, published in 1966, and Humbach's helpful review of it in the IIJ 12 (1969): 43-7.

Can anyone point me to some up-to-date information about Śākadvīpīya brahmans? What did it mean to a twelfth to seventeenth-century author to identify himself as belonging to a Śākadvīpīya family? Would such a family have retained cultural links to Central Asia and Eastern Iran, to Seistan? I would have thought not. But is there any scholarly exploration of this issue?
