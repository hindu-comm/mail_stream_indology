By the way, is H. von Stietenkron's PhD, published in 1966 available online to read or download?

I have not read Stietencron’s thesis. So I do not know if
he referred to the older account of the community available in Nagendra Nath
Basu’s Vanger jātīya itihās ‘Caste history of Bengal’,
Brāhmaṇakhaṇḍa (=Vol.1).
Basu has other writings on them, in English too, but these require corrections
and are not dependable.

Would such a family have retained cultural links to Central Asia and Eastern Iran, to Seistan? I would have thought not. But is there any scholarly exploration of this issue?
