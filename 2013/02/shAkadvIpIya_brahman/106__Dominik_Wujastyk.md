Can anyone point me to some up-to-date information about Śākadvīpīya
brahmans?  What did it mean to a twelfth to seventeenth-century author to
identify himself as belonging to a Śākadvīpīya family?  Would such a family
have retained cultural links to Central Asia and Eastern Iran, to Seistan?
I would have thought not.  But is there any scholarly exploration of this
issue?

Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
