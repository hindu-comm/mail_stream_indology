Dear List,


It was with great sorrow that we heard of the death of Prof. Mudumby Narasimhachary. Prof. Narasimhachary was Founder Professor & Head of the Department of Vaishnavism, University of Madras and a scholar published widely on Visistadvaita.

Oxford Center for Hindu Studies Facebook page has a post on this sad news.

Here is a brief account of him

He will be seriously missed by all at Oxford where he was Shivdasani Visiting Fellow (twice, most recently last year) and Director of Academic Affairs (2000â€“2001) at OCHS.
