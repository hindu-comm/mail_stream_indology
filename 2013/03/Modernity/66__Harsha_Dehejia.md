Friends~

I am doing a shsort piece on Modernity and the Hindu Mind. 

Is it right to say that Modernity (as understood as a state of being and not as modernisation) requires  the acceptance of: 

a break in tradition, 
the rise of the individual, 
democracy as a social and political norm,  
the strict separation of state and religion 
and above all the uncertaintly of knowledge.

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

Regards.

Prof. Harsha V. Dehejia
