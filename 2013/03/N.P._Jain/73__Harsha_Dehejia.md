Friends~ When in 1975 I was about to launch my second career I needed a Publisher to publish my Ph.D thesis.  Having been turned down my many it was N.P. Jain, whom we fondly called Prakashji, came to my rescue and I became a published author.  Twenty books and many years later I can never forget his embracing warmth and genuine hospitality. There will never be another Prakashji in the world of Indology. HarshaProf. Harsha V. Dehejia
