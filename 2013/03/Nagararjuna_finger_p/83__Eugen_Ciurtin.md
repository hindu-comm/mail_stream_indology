Thank you, Prof Vielle, for also clarifying this issue.

The English unauthorized translation you mentioned is/was freely available
on the net, it includes five volumes corresponding to the five ones
published in Louvain (the first two in very difficult conditions, as
mentioned by Mgr Lamotte in the preface). I would like to add it is not
always a faithful rendering of the French (compared with the late Sara
Boin-Webb's), is far for being flawless (especially in copying Sk/Pa
words/canonical phrases restored by Lamotte), and has many other
misspellings.

Best wishes,
Eugen Ciurtin
