By devavarṣa, they are probably referring to the Divine Year. The standard
description in the Sūrya Siddhānta and the Purāṇas  is that an year for
human beings is one ahorātra (day+night) for the gods.  Three hundred
ahoratras of gods make one *devavatsara, **divyavatsara *or *devavarṣa*.

On the other hand, the Jupiter Year, according to the data given in the
Sūrya Siddhānta, is 361days, 0h 38mins.

Regards,
Suresh.
