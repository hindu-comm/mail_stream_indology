Dear List Members,

I would be very happy if someone can share a PDF of the following article
with me. Despite my sincere efforts I was unable to find a copy of it
either in print or a PDF:

<<Grierson, Sir George A. 1929 The Language of the Mahā-naya-prakāśa: an
Examination of Kāshmīrī as Written in the Fifteenth Century, Memoirs of
the Asiatic Society of Bengal 11, pp. 73–130.>>

Thanks very much in advance.

Yours sincerely,

Mrinal Kaul
