Dear Dr.
Daheja,
I think
the answer to your question should depend on which Vedānta or which-age-Vedānta
you are addressing. Śaṅkara denounced and rejected Sānkhya challenging it as
the main adversary. But later Vedānta
accommodated the Sāṅkhya
philosophy as a lesser truth. 
Best

Friends~

Would it be correct to say that the Sankhya concept of Tan Matra would not be acceptable to the Advaita Vedantins as it brings in multiple, rather than, a single reality?

Kind regards.
