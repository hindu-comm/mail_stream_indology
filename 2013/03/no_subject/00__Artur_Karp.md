Dear All,

If, by any chance, anyone of you has access to this article:

Herman Tieken, “The interrogative pronouns kaṁ, kāni and kiṁti in the
Aśoka edicts", Acta Orientalia 64 (2003), pp. 39-63

I would be grateful for a pdf copy of it - our library does not
possess recent numbers of AO.

Regards and greetings from snow-covered Warsaw,


Artur Karp
Senior Lecturer in Sanskrit and Pali (ret.)
