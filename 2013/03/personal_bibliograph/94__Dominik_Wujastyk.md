Like many of us, over the years I've built up a large personal bibliography
of research publications.  The format of my stuff is
Bibtex<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibtex>
format.  From time to time, I output it for general use.  It's currently
approaching 3000 entries.

I have output my bibliography recently and placed it here:

   - http://www.academia.edu/492311/Working_bibliography_from_my_BibTeX_file

for general use.  It's not perfect, etc. etc.

Best,
