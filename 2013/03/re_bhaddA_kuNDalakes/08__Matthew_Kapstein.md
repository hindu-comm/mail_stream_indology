Dear Alberto,

There may be a version of the story from the Muulasaarvaastivaadin Vinaya trans. in 
Anton Schiefner, Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources. 
I am sorry that because I am away from my library just now I cannot
verify the reference.

There is certainly a version in K.semendra's Avadaanakalpalataa, where it figures as episode 93.
The Tibetan abridgement by Padma chos-'phel has been translated into French as 
La Liane Magique

hope this helps,
Matthew
