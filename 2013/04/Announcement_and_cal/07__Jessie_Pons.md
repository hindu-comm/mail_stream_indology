Dear list members,

The fifth International Indology Graduate Research Symposium (IIGRS) 
will be held at Bochum, Ruhr Universität, on the 17th-18th October 2013 
– please find all the information at http://iigrs.byethost17.com. The 
symposium is aimed at current graduate students, PhD candidates as well 
as early stage researchers, that is to say those who have completed 
their last degree within the past five years. The deadline for 
submitting abstracts is the 30th of June 2013. The proceedings of the 
symposium will be published in a series entitled “Puṣpikā: Tracing 
Ancient India Through Texts and Traditions. Contributions to Current 
Research in Indology”, published by Oxbow Books Press, Oxford.

If you are teaching at an institution, I would be extremely grateful if 
you could please circulate this information.

Kind regards,

Jessie Pons
Visiting Research Fellow
Ruhr Universität Bochum, Germany
