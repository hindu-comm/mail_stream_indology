Dear Patrick,

Forgive me if I've missed something in this discussion thread, but
isn't it likely that "dreer" is simply draSTR? This word appears 4
times it Patanjali's Yoga Sutras (1.3, 2.17, 2.20, 4.23) and denotes
the "seer" or "witness" (usually identified in the secondary
literature with the Samkhya concept of puruSa).

If you want to explore this concept I'd recommend Edwin Bryant's
translation and modern commentary, or T.S. Rukmani's translation of
Patanjali that also includes translations of Vyasa's and
Vijnanabhiksu's commentaries.

Best,
Andrew

Or at least become more familiar with the foundation of the practice from a historical and textual perspective, as it seems to be a prominent component  of this community's epistemological framework. The acaryas here are also at a loss to define what the etymology of the 'dreer' might be. At a first glance the head acaryas seem to support the possibility of it being sAkSIndriya. However, we continue with our investigation. Prof Bhattacharya's mention of the vedAntaparibhASA and nyAyakoza may help in our endeavour. I would appreciate copies of these texts if they are available in pdf.
