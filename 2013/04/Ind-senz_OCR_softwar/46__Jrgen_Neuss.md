Dear McComas and others,

the man behind indsenz is Oliver Hellwig, with whom I have been working  
together for many years in the now defunct Indological Department of the  
Freie Universität Berlin. I have been using the software for sanskritists  
he developed for many years now. He also developed the INDOSKRIPT database  
interface, which those concerned with Indian epigraphy might know. (It is  
available here: http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/falk/ ). With quite a lot of  
experience in OCR, I can assure you that there is nothing comparable to  
Indsenz's Devanagari OCR in the market. If you have a look at Indsenz's  
homepage, please also take a look at the SanskritTagger software, which is  
another tremendous tool being distributed as freeware by Oliver.

Best,

Jürgen
