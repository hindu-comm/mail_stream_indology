I
 have come across the following reference to an unpublished lecture by
David Pingree:

   - "Was any Scientific Work in India Regarded as a "Classic"?" Paper
   presented at the meeting of the Association for Asian Studies, Boston, 12
   April 1987.

Do you have a copy, by chance?

Best, and thanks,

Dominik Wujastyk
