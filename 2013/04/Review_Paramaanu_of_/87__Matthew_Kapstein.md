The conversation strikes me as engaging in anachronistic and one-sided stereotypes. Not long
ago many of my French colleague routinely, and with some derision, spoke of anglophone
philosophy as "l'analyse linguistique" and this still comes up in characterizations in the
popular press.

But times have changed - we find a new prominence of historical interest, and much more, in
anglophone philosophy over the past several decades. And even a small dose, here and there,
of anglophone analysis chez les français.

It seems not worth spilling ink (or, perhaps, projecting electrons) over the old battles and
resentments.
