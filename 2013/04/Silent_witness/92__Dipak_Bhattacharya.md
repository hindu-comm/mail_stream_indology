Dear Dr Maccartney,
Perhaps the Yogasuutra will be available at the Ashram. The I;svara described in the Samaadhipaada ie Y.S.1.24-25 might some help a bit
Best

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Silent witness


Thanks to every one who responded with some useful information regarding the silent witness. If anyone has a pdf of the book 'The Disinterested Witness' I would be most grateful to receive a copy.
>From a phenomenological perspective I am interested in exploring how to possibly operationalise such a practice into my current ethnographic research in an ashram in Gujarat. Or at least become more familiar with the foundation of the practice from a historical and textual perspective, as it seems to be a prominent component of this community's epistemological framework. The acaryas here are also at a loss to define what the etymology of the 'dreer' might be. At a first glance the head acaryas seem to support the possibility of it being sAkSIndriya. However, we continue with our investigation. Prof Bhattacharya's mention of the vedAntaparibhASA and nyAyakoza may help in our endeavour. I would appreciate copies of these texts if they are available in pdf.
Moreover, as a participant observer, I am exploring ways to perhaps improve upon Bourdieu's concept of the 'participant objectified' in which he asserts, allows for the required epistemological break, by objectifying the participant through taking a rarefied step back, in what sounds somewhat similar to the practice of the silent witness, or at least reminds myself of the practice.
Even though the intended results between the sociology of Bourdieu and practice of witness consciousness may be different it is interesting to think about the possibilities and similarities. Or, perhaps, it exposes my ignorance on both topics?
Best,
