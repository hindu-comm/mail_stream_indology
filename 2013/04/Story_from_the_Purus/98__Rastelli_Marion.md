Dear list members,

According to R.L. Mitra (The Antiquities of Orissa. Vol. 2, repr. Calcutta 1963, pp. 180 and 239), the Purusottamamahatmya includes a story in which Visnu in order to commemorate his victory over Gayasura left his foot-mark at Gaya, his discus at Bhuvanesvara, his conch at Puri and his lotus at Konarka.
Does anybody know the exact references of this story?

Best wishes,
Marion Rastelli
