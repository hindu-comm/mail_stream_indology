Dear James,

Are you in need of the original 1785 edition?  There is an 1867 reprint entitled The Bhăgvăt-gēētā: Or, Dialogues of Krĕĕshnă and Ărjŏŏn downloadable via Google books.

Best,

Steven

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Wilkins' Geeta

Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have a copy of Wilkins' 1785 Geeta translation?

It does not appear to be on internet archive.com., but it is in the public domain.

With Thanks,
