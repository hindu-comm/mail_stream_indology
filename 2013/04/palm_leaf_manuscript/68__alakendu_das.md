To ALL,

        I am aware of renowned Indian Indologist Ganpathy Shastri's unique contribution when he founded 13 plays by Bhasa,(5th-6th CE) in a bundle of  palm leaf manuscript in 1910.  

                           Can anyone enlighten me as to whether this was the earliest mss of medieval Sanskrit literature. 



                                            ALAKENDU DAS

                                       Post-graduate,Indology.
