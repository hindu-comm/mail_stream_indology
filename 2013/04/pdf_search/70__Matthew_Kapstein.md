Dear friends,

Alas, I seem to have misplaced my copy of the Tarkapāda!

Might any of you have a pdf of

Sastradipika (Tarkapada) of Parthasarathi Misra ( Gaekwad's Oriental Series No. LXXXIX ) BHATTACHARYYA, B., Edited by; VENKATRAMIAH, D. (Translator).?

Sorry about the absence of diacriticals, and,

as ever, thanks in advance for your kind help,
Matthew
