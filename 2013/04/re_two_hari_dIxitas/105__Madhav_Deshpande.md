The mystery of the two Hari Dīkṣitas is now resolved satisfactorily.  Hari
Dīkṣita, the author of the Brahmasūtravṛtti is the son of Lakṣmīnṛsiṃha who
composed the Advaitic commentary Ābhoga on Kalpataru, a commentary on
Vācaspatimiśra's Bhāmatī, and this Lakṣmīnṛsiṃha is the son of
Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa, who  is the nephew of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita.  So, one Hari Dīkṣita
is the author of the Bṛhacchabdaratna, and the grandson of Bhaṭṭoji
Dīkṣita, while the other Hari Dīkṣita is the great-grandson of Bhaṭṭoji
Dīkṣita's brother Raṅgojibhaṭṭa.  No wonder that both Hari Dīkṣitas show
respect to Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
