Right! But they surely mentioned the author's name. What happens elsewhere is different. There is one Cosmo Publishers with office (main?) in Delhi. They published something like an encyclopaedia of the tantras. The fourth chapter of a 1984 publication of mine was copied and printed therein without my name even once being mentioned. Some friend consoled me that it proved at least that my work had some value. 
Even celebrated authors do not escape being plagiarized. Satavalekar is a well-known name to Vedic scholars. A firm in Delhi is reprinting his works in their name even before 6o years (copyright limit according to Indian law) passed after his death. Examples will be a legion.
But I refrain from mentioning them

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Brill acquires the Forsten Indology list



>From Brill's press release announcing its 2012 results:

Brill’s net profit in 2012 (EUR 5.7 million) is the highest ever in the company’s history.
>Operational margin (EBITDA/revenue) decreased to 15.4% (2011: 16.7%).  

Who knows how much of this came from its Indological list, but a part of it will have come from an edited volume I ordered (for our library) for the usual €150 or US$200. It was quite clear that next to no editorial work had been done. Just one example: one chapter, clearly lifted from the author's dissertation, referred to something mentioned "in the previous chapter" -- evidently, of the dissertation, not the edited volume, in which the previous chapter was by another author on an unrelated topic. Of course the editors bear some responsibility for this, but the press surely does too, especially at these prices. 

Best wishes

Will
