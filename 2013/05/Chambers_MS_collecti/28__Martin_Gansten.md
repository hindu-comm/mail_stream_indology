Many thanks to all who replied, on and off the list, with helpful 
advice. I have tried a couple of the addresses mentioned and am waiting 
for a response.

Incidentally, the replies of Madhav Deshpande and Rosane Rocher below 
never reached me: I became aware of them only through their being quoted 
in Michael Witzel's post. I don't know why this should be -- could list 
administrators shed any light? Perhaps there have been other replies, 
too, that I have missed?
