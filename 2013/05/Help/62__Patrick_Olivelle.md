Friend:

I am trying to identify two citations, one apparently from a smṛti and the other from a Vedic text. These are found in Viśvarūpa's commentary on the Yājñavalkya Smṛti, 1.7 (Trivandrum edition, p. 20). These are cited by an opponent supporting the independent authority of smṛtis: tasmāt svātantryaṃ smṛtīnām ity uktam. Then follows the citations:

1. tathā cāha: "agranthakānām arthānāṃ cakāropanibandhanam."

2. āmnāyaś ca "yady ukto bhūr" ityādy upakramya "yajuṣṭas sāmata" ity uktvā, "yady avijñātam" ity āha.

Then he cites a sampradāya: smārtaṃ cāvijñātam iti saṃpradāyaḥ.

Any help in locating these would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.

Patrick
