Dear Patrick, in the second quote, read ṛkto instead of ukto. I could  
not trace the exact source, but this is about the prāyaścitta mantras,  
bhūr in the case of the RV, bhuvaḥ in the case of the YV, svar in the  
case of the SV, and bhūr bhuvaḥ svar if it not known which Veda is  
concerned. Cf. AB 5,32; KB 6,12; ŚŚS 3,21,1-6; ĀśvŚS 1,12,31-33. Best  
regards, Asko
