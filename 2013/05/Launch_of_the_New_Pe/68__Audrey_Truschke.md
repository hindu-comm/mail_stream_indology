Dear Colleagues,

Some of you may be interested in the launch of the new website of
Perso-Indica: an analytical Survey of Persian Works on Indian Learned
Traditions. http://www.perso-indica.net/.

Perso-Indica is an ongoing research project that seeks to produce a
comprehensive critical survey of Persian works on Indian learned traditions
(above all, Sanskrit). The project covers treatises and translations
produced in India between the 13th and the 19th centuries. With the launch
of the new website, forty-five preliminary entries are now live, and the
dynamic indexes allow unprecedented insight into the extent and nature of
Indo-Persian interest in Indian knowledge systems.

We will be adding to the Perso-Indica website in the coming months and hope
that the project will significantly advance scholarly knowledge about one
of the largest translation movements in Indian history.

Audrey
