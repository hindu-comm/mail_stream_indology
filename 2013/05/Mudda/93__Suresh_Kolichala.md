It is not uncommon to find redundant compounds in the Indian languages. In
Hindi, pleonastic compounds such as *tan*-*badan *(body-body), *dhan*-*daulat
*(wealth-wealth) and *nātā*-*riṣta *(relationship-relationship) are very
commonly used. What is interesting about these compounds is that while one
of the words in the compound is native, the other word is usually foreign
(Perso-Arabic).

For a discussion on pleonastic compounds in Dravidian, you may refer to:
Chandrasekaran, Periannan 2011  Pleonastic Compounding: An Ancient
Dravidian Word Structure. *Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies* 5: 1-57. (
http://www.laurasianacademy.com/pleonastic.pdf‎)

Given the abundant evidence of redundant compounds in India, I don't see
anything unusual about the use of the compound *muddā*-*daśā.*
