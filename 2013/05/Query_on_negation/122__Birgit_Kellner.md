Brendan Gillon once argued that the distinction between the two types of 
negation called prasajyapratiṣedha and paryudāsa is precisely the one 
that accounts for the different interpretations in Patrick Olivelle's 
example: a syntactic difference in terms of whether the negation has 
wide scope (prasajyap.) - "not knowing the dharma" - or narrow scope 
(paryudāsa) - "knowing something that is not dharma". But I can't think 
of indicators other than context that would allow to determine which 
interpretation is to be preferred.

Medhātithi commenting on this verse (and the Smṛticandrikā [Mysore ed. III: 287] cites Medh approvingly) appears to think that these two men were proficient in adharma, that is, in subterfuge (chala). Then the compound would consist of adharma and jña -- adharma being here ways of subverting justice. In the Smṛticandrikā the example given is a man who, knowing that other kinds of evidence is valid only for a year (I am not sure how he gets this??), gets a document written with 10 thousand paṇas, when it should have been just 5 thousand. This is the chala or adharma (ways of getting around legal procedures) in which the man if proficient.
