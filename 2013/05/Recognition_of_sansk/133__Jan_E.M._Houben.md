Dear Listmembers,

Although the French Vedic scholar Louis Renou in the first half of the
previous century still learned Dutch in order to read work of Willem Caland
in the latter's own language, there is at present no hope left for Dutch as
academic language. English is indisputably "ruling the waves" in academic
discourse, other languages such as French and German are trying to survive
in the same domain.

Sanskrit has now also been recognized, at least de facto/implicitly, as
medium for academic discourse in one of the bulwarks of French
bibliometrics:
the HALSHS archive.
