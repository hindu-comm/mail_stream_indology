Dear Chris and others,

  I do not know if Speier/Speyer/Speijer's _Sanskrit Syntax_ has been re-typeset or not, but there are publications for sale that give the impression of a new edition.  I discovered this when attempting to purchase a copy a couple of years ago only to discover that some "enterprising" individuals have been data mining Google books (and/or possibly the DLI) and selling exceptionally poor copies (missing pages, underlining, margin notes, etc.) of many books (including Speijer's) through a print-on-demand service as "new books". Just a warning to beware.

  I can say that the 2009 paperback from Motilal is very clean and readable.

best,

Paul Hackett
Columbia University

The program begins with a keynote address by Professor Emeritus Hans Hock who in 1986 edited the volume on Sanskrit syntax in honor of the centennial of Speier's Sanskrit Syntax.  The second day of the program begins with a special lecture by George Cardona concerned with contributions of Paninian grammar to Sanskrit syntax.  The afternoon of the 15th will include several presentations on the state of image-text alignment for Sanskrit manuscripts.  Please see the announcement of the seminar and the full program under Events on the Sanskrit Library website.
