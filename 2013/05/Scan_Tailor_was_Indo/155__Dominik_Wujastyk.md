Many thanks to Joseph for making this text readily available at archive.org!

Incidentally, while we're talking about scanning, there's a nifty tool
called Scan Tailor that can greatly improve the quality of scans.  It's
free (as in beer), Open Source (free as in speech), and available
ready-compiled for Windows and Linux.  Get your copy here:

   - http://scantailor.sourceforge.net/

Scan Tailor can semi-automatically separate scanned book openings into left
and right pages; it can recognize the outline of the printed area of the
page; it can provide new, clean margins; it can clean up speckles and even
do some de-warping.  The results are excellent, though it does take some
hand-holding, so one has to invest a bit of time to do a whole book.   But
90% of the work is automatic.  Recommended.

Best,

Dominik
