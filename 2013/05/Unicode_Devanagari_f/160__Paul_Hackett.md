Dear members of the list,

   Does anyone know of a Unicode Devan훮gar카 font that functions under Adobe's InDesign?  I have been unable to locate one either for free or for sale.

   All of the available Unicode Devan훮gar카 fonts that I have found and attempted to use (Devanagari Sangam, e-Nagari, Devanagari MT, JanaHindi, Nakula, Sahadeva, Sakal Bharati, etc.) break up conjuncts and misplace preceding vowels in documents under InDesign.

   Any recommendations would be appreciated.

Thank you,

Paul Hackett
