I find an old note that

Karve 1943-1944: 71 has remarked on the uses of *mātṛ* and *ambā* for both
natural mother and step-mother in the *Mahābhārata*

Karve, Irawati. 1943-1944. “Kinship Terms and the Family Organization as
Found in the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata.” *Bulletin of the Deccan
College Research Institute* 5: 61-148..
