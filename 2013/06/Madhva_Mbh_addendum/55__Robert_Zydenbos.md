At last I found my copy of the latest commentary:

Śrīmadānandatīrthabhagavatpādaviracitaṃ citrakāvyaṃ 
Śrīmahābhāratatātparyyam. Śrīnaraharitīrthaviracitayā 
Śrīkṛṣṇaprakāśikayā Ācāryagovindaviracitayā Śrīkṛṣṇacandrikayā sahitam. 
[Sasaṃhitapāṭhaṃ sapadapāṭhaṃ ca.] Śodhayitā-sampādayitā 
Bannañjepadohāhva Ācāryagovindaḥ. [Mahābhārata-tātparyam. By 
Ananda-Thirtha-bhagavat-pada; with Śrī-Kṛṣṇa-Prakāśikā, a commentary by 
Sri-Narahari-Thirtha and Śrī-Kṛṣṇa-Candrikayā by Bannanje 
Govindacharya.] Udupi / Bangalore: Īśāvāsya-pratiṣṭhāna, 2006. Price Rs. 
80. With an introduction and six appendices. (Distributors: Bannanje 
Associates, Īśāvāsyam, Ambalapadi, Udupi - 576103.

The book is entirely in Sanskrit, edited and commented by the editor of 
the mūlapāṭha of Madhva's collected works (with whom an interview 
appeared, in Sanskrit, in the Münchener Indologische Zeitschrift I 
(2008/09) - see http://www.manyaverlag.de/miz-I.html and a sample 
http://www.manyaverlag.de/mizproben/MIZ-I-Interview.pdf).

Govindacharya also pubhished a short study in Kannada on the textual 
criticism by Madhva in the Mahābhārata-tātparya: Vidyāvācaspati Bannañje 
Gōvindācārya. Mahābhārata tātparya nirṇaya. Eraḍu upanyāsagaḷu. Udupi: 
Rāṣṭrakavi Gōvinda Pai Saṃśōdhana Kēṃdra, 1993.

Hope this helps,
