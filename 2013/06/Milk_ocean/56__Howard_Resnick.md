I would appreciate help with the following:

The Puranas describe Sveta-dvipa, "White Island", an abode of Vishnu lying within the Milk Ocean (ksiroda, ksiradhi, ksira-sagara).

Tri-kuta mountain is also said to be surrounded by the Milk Ocean.

Is there any Puranic description of the location of Sveta-dvipa in relation to Tri-kuta?

Thanks!
Howard Resnick
