P.s. the verse has several parallels I can dig up for you if you don't know
them, and it is historically important because it shows that for orthodox
brāhmaṇas at this time, contact with an initiated Śaiva is as polluting as
contact with an untouchable -- which I hope makes one hesitate to place
Śaivism under the rubric "Hinduism", at least for the early medieval period.
