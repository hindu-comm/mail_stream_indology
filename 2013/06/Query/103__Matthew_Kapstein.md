Some in this thread raised the question of the status/purity of Śaivas vis-a-vis
brahmanical orthodoxy. It may be of interest here to note that in the 11th c.
Prabodhacandrodaya the Kāpālikas are treated as beyond the pale but that
other Śaivas, as well as of course the Vaiṣṇavas, are regarded as allies of
orthodoxy.

If no one has yet done so (and if they have, I'd be grateful for the references), an interesting
project might be to map out diachronically and geographically the changes in 
attitude in regard to the religious traditions concerned.
