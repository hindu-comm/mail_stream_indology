Judit Törzsök and Dominic Goodall have an entry on the Kārukas in vol. II (p.92) of the Tāntrikābhidhānakoṣa:

> kāruka, n.m. [].
> A Pāśupata* or Lākula* sect, mentioned several times in Bhairavatantras* and by Abhinavagupta as inferior to tantric Śaivas; none of their texts seems to have survived. They are referred to in SvT 11.71ff. where they are said to be at the level of māyātattva* when liberated; SYM 1.18 mentions them together with pramāṇa-pāśupatas, whose initiation is not appropriate in the system of the SYM (accepting Diwakar Acharya’s emendation of kāraka to kāruka in the text, personal communication), and TĀ 13.305 also notes that they remain bound souls from the point of view of Bhairavatantras. Kṣemarāja’s commentary suggests that the founder of the sect was a disciple of Lakuleśa, just as Musulendra was. [J.T.]
> Kārukas are held to be impure and contact with them is to be avoided according to the following Siddhāntas: Kir 35.8, 38.7; Moh, fol. 44v; PKm 1.111. [D.G.]
