Although Ludo Rocher taught Sanskrit in French at the U. of Brussels in 
the late 1950's, he used vol. 2 (the anthology part) by Thumb and 
Hauschild, with notes and vocabulary in German, to introduce us to 
Sanskrit texts.  It includes Nala 1-5.  As you will appreciate, it 
worked well.

Cheers,
Rosane Rocher
