Dear Collagues,

I am having problems tracing a copy of a text entitled either Ādipurāṇa or Nāradaśaunakasaṃvāda in any library catalogue available to me.  The work is mentioned in NCC vol. 2 p. 83, also by Raghavan in his Greater Ramayana 1973 p.65, as published by Venkateswara Press in 1907 (1908 in Raghavan 1973).  Does anyone have access to a copy?  I am interested specifically in 16.29-69 of its text and a scan of that portion would be ideal.  Many thanks to anyone who can help in any way.

Yours

John Brockington
