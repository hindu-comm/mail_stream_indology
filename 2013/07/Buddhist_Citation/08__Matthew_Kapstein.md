Dear Patrick,

I am presently away from my library and so can only hazard a guess, but it may be worthwhile to check if K is
paraphrasing something from the Mahāyānasūtrālamkāra or the Abhisamayāyālamkāra. The general idea that
the bodhisattva takes to himself the fruitsof the world's evils, while aspiring for itsfull liberation, is
quite widespread in Mahāyāna literature in any case. 

best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Buddhist Citation

I wonder whether any of you can help me with a citation in Kumārila's Tantravārttika (on PMS 1.3.4; ĀnSS p. 114).

buddhādeḥ punar ayam eva vyatikromo 'alaṃkārubuddhau sthitaḥ | tenaivam āha |

 kalikaluṣakṛtāni yāni loke mayi nipatantu vimucyatāṃ tu lokaḥ ||

Does anyone know of a Buddhist text called Alaṃkārabuddhi? Or is this a misreading of a different text with a similar name?

Thanks.

Patrick
