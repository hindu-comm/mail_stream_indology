Thank you very much dear Svevo for this useful information.
The reason of my question was a bio-bibiographical notice I am currently writing on Paul-Emile Dumont (Brussels 1879 - Baltimore 1968).
His PhD was from the University of Bologna. See (University of Bologna digital archives):

Paolo Dumont di Saint Gilles (Belgio), Facoltà di Lettere, 24/06/1903, tesi: Tesi mancante: Degli scambi di parole avvenuti fra l'india e il mondo ellenico in seguito ai loro rapporti politici e commerciali, e delle leggi fonetiche che se ne possano trarre


If somebody knows an obituary notice on P.E. Dumont, I would be interested by the reference or a copy. Presently, beside his Indological writings and  a few family archives, I only have the reference to an obituary published in the Baltimore Sun (or The Sun, Baltimore) on the 10th of December 1968 (but no copy of it). Any living testimony would be also appreciated.
Best wishes,
Christophe Vielle
