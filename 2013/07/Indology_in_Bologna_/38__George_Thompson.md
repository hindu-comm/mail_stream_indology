Dear Christophe and others who have contributed to this discussion,

I myself am unable to contribute to it, because I do not have access to a
good library.  But I do very much want to know more about the history of
Indology.  And so I thank you for posting these notes to the list, and
encourage you to continue.

Best wishes to all,

George
