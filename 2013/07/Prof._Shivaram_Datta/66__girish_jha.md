Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Prof. Shivaram Dattatray Joshi, 15-8-1926 - 29-7-2013



I had the privilege of reading privately the Mahābhāṣya with S. D. Joshi in December 1963, when I was working on my doctoral dissertation (on the 14th āhnika). In addition to the clarity of his comment, I enjoyed participating in a tradition of oral instruction of vyākaraṇa of which he was a master. He remained a dear friend and an example of positive scholarship.

With sadness we learn of the demise of Prof. Shivaram Dattatray Joshi, who has been for many decades, in the words of his friend, student and close collaborator Dr. J.A.F. Roodbergen, “il maestro di color che sanno in the field of Sanskrit grammar.” He will live on, to use Brendan Gillon's terms, in "his published work" and in "his erudite students" (who have become the teachers ofPāṇini-students of my own generation).
