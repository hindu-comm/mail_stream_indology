Friends,
I have to report with a heavy heart that I just came to know
that Professor Dr. Abhijit Ghosh, Jadavpur University, passed away yesterday within
the University premises. He was just 60. After Chatterji, Przyluski, Burrow and
Kuiper, Ghosh came to be known as the best authority on Austric elements in
Vedic. Often appearing a hard non-conformist Ghosh had many human qualities and
felt for and helped others. His loss creates a vacuum that will be felt for a
long time.
