Thank you for you comment and for the suggestion. I have already spoken with the responsible of the Library. All the scans of the volumes (1st edition and some of the 2nd edition which in some cases entail different districts- total: 30 volumes) and this "first-level" cataloging have been done with internal resources.  I am waiting for them to decide if they are willing to apply for some founding in order to have at least the transliteration in the searchable form. 
Your email, as well as that of Andrew Ollet, is of great help in trying to convince them.
I’ll contact Dr. Schmiedchen and I’ve already written to Dr. Voegeli who has worked on Epigraphia Indica: I would like to try to organize a workshop here in Tübingen summoning the people who works to bring Indological texts into the digital age (as, e.g., the Sanskrit Manuscript Project in Cambridge as well as Bhasa Project). 

Any help and advise are really most welcomed,

Best Wishes
Elena Mucciarelli

In fact a start was made towards the digitization, with human proofreading of OCR-results, of EC volume I, by Annette Schmiedchen with assistance of Reinhold Gruenendahl a few years ago, but I am not sure how far Dr. Schmiedchen came.

This is entirely null for the hundreds of pages of contents in Kannada script (which perhaps may be excused if Kannada OCR does not yet exist), but the OCR-ed results for the parts in roman script, in particular the transliterations of the actual inscriptions, appears not to be of much greater value. This means that the search function that is offered will allow nobody to actually find the epigraphic attestations of words that they are looking for.

This will mean a lot of extra work, but will do much more to truly bring Epigraphia Carnatica into the digital age.
