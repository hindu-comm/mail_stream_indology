I am very sad to hear this news.  Prof. Joshi was, I think many will
agree, a genius.  His knowledge of vyākaraṇa was deep and subtle.  Yet his
great mastery did not prevent him from being a kind and supportive teacher
towards beginners.  I will always be grateful to him for his teaching, and
especially for suggesting my PhD topic and guiding me initially in it.

In sadness,
Dominik Wujastyk
