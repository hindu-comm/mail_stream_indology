L.S. Cousins

> In the USA, Lanman's A Sanskrit Reader was, for a century or more, the

> only in recent decades with the appearance of Goldman and Goldman, 
> Scharf, Hock, etc).
>
> Is there an equivalent introductory text that was used in Europe 
> (Stenzler?) �Do European Sanskrit students also work with Nala as a 
> first text (which I know is found in Bopp, Boehtlink, Monier-Williams, 
> Stenzler, and Lanman)?
