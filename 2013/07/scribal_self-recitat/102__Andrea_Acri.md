Dear Jonathan,

I have discussed this very briefly on p. 65 of my book 'Dharma Pātañjala’ (Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 2011), referring to A. Dain’s 'Les Manuscrits’ (first ed. 1949, second ed. 1964, reprint 1975 etc.), in particular pp. 20–22 and 43–46.

All best,

Andrea

dear Colleagues.

Recently I told a student that errors in transcription which appear prima facie to be due to oral recitation may well also stem from copying a written exemplar, since scribes are known to recite to themselves, as it were, when copying. I think/thought that this was well known, but she tells me that she's looked around and not found a discussion of this idea. I have no idea now where I learnt it (although i believe it to be true). Any references?

thanks so much, jonathan
