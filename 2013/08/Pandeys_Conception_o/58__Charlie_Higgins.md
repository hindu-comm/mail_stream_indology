Does anyone have a pdf of this paper: Pandey, R.  "Conception of a House
and Domestic Facilities in the Atharvaveda," MadhyabhAratI 3, no. 3 (1965):
14-18.

My ILL department recently sent me an email back saying the article was
unattainable, although I notice that numerous libraries possess the
journal.  A pdf can be sent to: charlie_higgins at hotmail.com.

Thank you!!

Charlie
