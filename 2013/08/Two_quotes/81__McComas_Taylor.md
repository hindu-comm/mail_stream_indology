Dear Colleagues

There are two fine quotations that I have in my mind, but I cannot locate the original sources. The sense of the quotes is as follows:

1. an English quote: to be Hindu is to be purāṇic (i.e. purāṇic discourses are at the heart of contemporary Hindu beliefs and practices)

2. a Sanskrit śloka:  worms/bugs/grubs/insects (which consume MSS) have a great appetite for Sanskrit literature

Any responses offline to mccomas.taylor at anu.edu.au<mailto:mccomas.taylor at anu.edu.au>  would be gratefully received.

Thanks in advance

McComas
