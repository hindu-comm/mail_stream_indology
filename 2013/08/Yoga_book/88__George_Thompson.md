Hello Joseph and list,

A quick note to your two recent queries to the Indology List:

1.  I have read the 1954 Renou article 25-30 years ago, and I have a
photocopy of it in  a file somewhere.  Unfortunately, I can't find it right
now, because most of my photocopies and offprints are stored away in a
storage unit and I can't find individual papers right now.  However, I can
say this: the most important paper that Renou wrote on les pouvoirs de la
parole dans le RV is in his EVP 1 [1955].  There is, I think, nothing in
the 1954 paper that is not also included in the 1955 paper, which is more
developed and clearer.  The 1955 paper in EVP 1 is one of Renou's most
important papers when it comes to the RV.  Nevertheless, if you are
interested in the development of Renou's thoughts on this issue, I can make
some effort to find the earlier paper if you wish.

2.  Just to let you know that Hauer's book is also available as a
print-on-demand book.  I orefer books to pdf's because I like to be able to
read them anywhere, and I like to make notes in my books.

If you want information on how to order the print-on-demand book [warning:
not at all a high quality reprint, but legible, let me know off-list].

My best to you and to the List.

George Thompson
