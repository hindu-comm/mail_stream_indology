Dear list,

I am searching for a copy of the Krīḍākauśalya section (6.20) of 
Harikṛṣṇa Vyaṅkaṭarāma Śarmā's Bṛhajjyotiṣārṇava from 1871. The 
entire work was published by Venkateshwar Steam Press in 1900, and a 
Sanskrit/Hindi version of the Krīḍākauśalya section was published by Nag 
Publishers in 1982, but I have been unable to procure copies - digital 
or otherwise - of any of them.

Any help in locating this work will be much appreciated.

Kind regards,
Jacob
