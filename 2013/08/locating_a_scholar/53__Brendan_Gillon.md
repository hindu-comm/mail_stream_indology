Dear colleagues,

A colleague of mine here at McGill University is trying to locate

Dhanesh Jain, co-author with George Cardona of _The Indo-Aryan Languages_:

http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Indo_Aryan_Languages.html?id=C9MPCd6mO6sC&redir_esc=y 


If someone has coordinates (email address or snail mail address), I 
would appreciate receiving it.

Thanks in advance,

Brendan Gillon
