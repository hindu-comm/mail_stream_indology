Dear Jim,
according to my notes, some early references about female gait resembling that of an elephant include Bhavabhūti MM 9, 27, Dhūrtaviṭasaṁvāda after 16, Pādatāḍitaka 88, Kumāradāsa Jānakīh. 1, 29, and Manu 3, 10. For male, princely gait already in the Rāmāyaṇa (e.g. 1, 47, 2 and 2, 38, 6). In 3, 44, 18f.  Sītā’s thigh is smooth as an elephant’s trunk.  

Best,
Klaus

The expression is usually thought to come from Kalidasa but I've not found it in a cursory search of his work.  The earliest occurrences seem to be in the Mahabharata.  Any confirmation of texts using gajagamini and details of elephant similes in kavya would be welcome e.g.  women's thighs like elephant trunks, breasts like elephants' bosses.
