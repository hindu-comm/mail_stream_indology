Hi Andrew,

I’d wager a guess that Vīraka is short for Vīrabhadra, who is one of Śiva’s well-known gaṇas (though admittedly I hadn’t thought about *when* he enters Śiva’s entourage). If that’s the case bet the –ka suffix is probably abbreviative, for metrical purposes, rather than diminutive in meaning. :)

All best,
Travis

Subject: [INDOLOGY] "vIraka"

Dear learned colleagues,

In Kurma Purana 2.7 there is a section praising Siva, in which classes
of beings are named and he is identified with the best in each of
those classes; this is similar to the section extolling Krsna at BhG
10.21-39.

In the final quarter of 2.7.10 is "gaNeSAnAM ca vIrakaH". Can any of
you help me identify who this "vIraka" (mannikin, little man) is? Is
it a reference to some specific form of Siva, or perhaps to Skanda or
Ganapati himself?

Many thanks for your help.

Andrew
