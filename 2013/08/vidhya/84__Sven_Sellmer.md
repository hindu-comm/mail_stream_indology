Thanks a lot for all your quick responses!

Actually, I had come across spellings like "sathya" and thought that it might have something to do with Dravidian languages. Now I understand the logic behind it. What still puzzles me are examples from further North like:

Gujarat: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Vidhya_Sabha
Madhya Pradesh: Vidhya Sagar Secondary School in Bhopal (http://www.justdial.com/Bhopal/vidhya-sagar-higher-secondary-school-%3Cnear%3E-Bhanpur/0755P755STD71001_BZDET) etc.

But perhaps this is just the influence of South Indian transcription styles.

All the best,
Sven

> In the Dravidian South the spellings th, dh are quite common to indicate dental, rather than retroflex pronunciation. Since Dravidian languages do not have aspirates natively (with possibly some minor exceptions in some numerals), English th [θ], which is dental, would be rendered as dental [t], while post-dental Engl. t was identified as retroflex [ṭ] and hence could be used to spell the retroflex voiceless stop. The pattern evidently was extended to the voiced stops in order to make the same distinction. (The use of th, dh to indicate dental stops is not employed systematically; so a fair amount of spelling variation occurs.)
