I'm extremely grateful to Ashok Aklujkar for passing on to me a PDF of
the *Indian
Studies ... Lanman* book.  I have added the PDF to the Internet Archive,
since it is out of copyright.

http://archive.org/details/IndianStudiesInHonorOfCharlesRockwellLanman

At the Archive, the derivative copies (DjVu, Kindle, online reader) take
some time to be automatically derived from the uploaded PDF.  If you check
back in a few hours or tomorrow, that processing should be complete.

Best,
