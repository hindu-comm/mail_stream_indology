In *New Dimensions in Jaina Logic*, English rendering by Natmal Tatia  
of Yuvacarya Mahaprajna´s "Jaina Nyaya ka Vikasa", Ladnun: Jaina  
Vishva Bharati, 1984, p. 174, the entry reads:

"Sumati (8th-9th century A.D.)
Vādirājasūri has made a mention of his _Sanmatitarkaṭīkā_ in the  
_Pārśvanāthacarita_ written by himself. There is a mention of his  
_Sumatisaptaka_ in the eulogy of Malliṣeṇa".

The Jaina Siddhānta Kośa does not seem to have anything on this philosopher.

Hope this helps.
