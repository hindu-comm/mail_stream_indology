Dear Members of the Indology list,

Due to the large number of participants who have already registered for the
international conference “Yoga in Transformation” that will be held in
Vienna from September 19-21 2013, the organizers changed the location to
the Faculty of Computer Sciences of the University of Vienna, Lecture Hall
1, Währingerstr. 29, 1090 Vienna, Austria (see the map at
http://www.yogaintransformation.wissweb.at).

Potential participants who are just interested in selected parts of the
conference may register for individual days or just for one (or two) of the
public evening lectures.

Please note that because of organizational requirements registration for
the conference is only possible until September 13.

With best regards,

Philipp Maas
