Dear colleagues,

I'm searching for an article that I'm finding rather tricky to track down, and hoping that one of you might be able to help me out with a scan. 

Schmidt, Hanns-Peter. 1980. “Notes on Ṛgveda 7.18.5-10,” Indica (Organ of the Heras Institute of Indian History and Culture, Bombay) 17: 41-47.

Although our library at UBC has the journal, I'm currently out of station, and have been unable to find it in the usual electronic locations (archive.org, DLI, etc.--google has it in snippet view only) and the library where I currently am has the journal but not this particular issue. 

So, I'm hoping one of you kind folks might already have a scan of this paper and could send it to me! 

Thanks very much, and all best wishes,
Adheesh
