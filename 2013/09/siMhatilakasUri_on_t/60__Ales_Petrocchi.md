Dear all,
I am working on the full translation of the mathematical commentary
by Siṃhatilakasūri
(13th CE) on the
*Gaṇitatilaka* by Śrīpati (11th CE).

. According to Pingree, Siṃhatilakasūri  wrote a vṛtti at Vijāpur (Gujarat)
in 1269 on the jyotiṣa-work *Bhuvanadīpaka* by Padmaprabhasūri.

 I wonder if anyone knows  whether such commentary has ever been published
or if it is possible to locate the manuscripts.

Thank you very much in advance,
 sincerely,
Alessandra.
