Thank you, Oliver,

but my question was really whether or not anyone has noticed its being used
adjectively. SindUra, like gAndhAra, is recorded as a noun in the lexicons 
and dictionaries at my disposal. But this nominal usage does not make
sense in the context I am looking at (its occurrence in a long list of adjectival qualities-pale, soft, sweet-smelling).

with thanks again for your kind attention,

Mathew
