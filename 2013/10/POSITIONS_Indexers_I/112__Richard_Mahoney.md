Dear Colleagues,

Brill Academic Publishers is looking for two to four indexers for its
new classified bibliography for Buddhist Studies edited in close
collaboration with the Center for Religious Studies (CERES), Ruhr
University Bochum, Germany.

It is intended that the Index Buddhicus will be the main academic
bibliographical reference in the field of Buddhist studies. It will
consist of classified bibliographical records for monographs, reviews,
chapters in edited volumes, journal articles, reference works,
electronic resources, and whatever else is thought relevant.

The indexers will be appointed on a project basis, but in the longer
term a fixed position within the framework of the project is possible.
Further details are available here:

Please direct all enquires to Prof. Sven Bretfeld, Ruhr University
Bochum, Universitaetsstr. 150, FNO 01/176, 44780 Bochum.

Kind regards,

    Richard
