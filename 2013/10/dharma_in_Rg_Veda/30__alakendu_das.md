  To All,

          Can anybody furnish me any references where the word 'Dharma' has been mentioned in Rg Veda.?The objective is to know whether Dharma is a Post-Vedic concept or not.?



                                        ALAKENDU DAS

                                      Post-Graduate,Indology.
