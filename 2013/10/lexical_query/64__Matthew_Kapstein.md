Have any of my fellow Indologists ever noticed gaandhaara used as an adjective designating
a tangible property of some sort (i.e. as gaura designates 'pale')?

Such a usage does not seem to be known to MW, Apte or the other dictionaries I have consulted.

It does occur as a synonym of sinduura, 'red lead', so perhaps 'reddish'?

thanks in advance for your learned assistance,
Matthew
