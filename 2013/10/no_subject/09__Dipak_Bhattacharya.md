Ramanandis are known as northern followers of Rāmānuja. According
to some late medieval worksj the eight followers, Sant Kabir one of them, are
said to have introduced eight sects all claiming their origin to Ramanand. I
met some Ramanandi holy men, called Babaji that is Reverend Father, belonging
to the mother church (sampradāya) established by Ramanand himself. They
have an independent commentary on the Brahmasūtra. 
Late Professor Schokker was a knowledgeable person on some
of these late medieval saints whom he understood as Protestants of Hinduism. 
Many of the Minor Upaniṣads cater to the needs of such late
medieval sects. Unfortunately study on the Minor Upaniṣads is in a poor state.
Will this help?
