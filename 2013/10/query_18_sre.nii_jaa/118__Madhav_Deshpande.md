Dear Patrick,

     In continuation of Ashok's suggestion, I want to point out that there
is an expression in Marathi अठरा पगड जाती "18 types of Jātis".  Some of the
Jātinirṇaya texts produced by Marathi Pandits may have some local listings
similar to what Ashok has given.  I have one or two such texts, and will
check if they have any list of 18 Jātis.

Madhav
