Dear Mrinal,

I understand 'chāyāpuruṣa' to mean just what it sounds like: the shadow person.  Numerous tantric and tantric-derived texts discuss prognostications based on watching subtle changes in one's shadow on a clear and sunny day.  The IFP's paper transcripts include a chāyāpuruṣalakṣaṇa (#T0620), which is available from Muktabodha's portal and might be helpful.  Consider also this clear passage from the Yogamārgaprakāśikā of Yugaladāsa (typed by Péter-Dániel Szántó):

	[atha chāyāpuruṣasya vidhānam] 

śuddhātape svadehasya pratibimbaṃ vilokayet | 
bhūmau dṛṣṭvā tathā khe ca pratīkopāsanāṃ caret || 9 ||
yogī samabhyasen nityaṃ svapratīkaṃ yathāvidhi | 
tena vijñāyate sarvaṃ lābhālābhau bhavābhavau || 10 ||
śiraś chinnaṃ tathā kampas tadā mṛtyur bhaved dhruvam | 
yadā na dṛśyate bāhur bhrātṛhānis tu jāyate || 11 ||
samastāni ca hy aṅgāni svapratīkena paśyati | 
tat sarvaṃ ca vijānīyāt tasya hānir na saṃśayaḥ || 12 ||
yaḥ karoti sadābhyāsaṃ guptācāreṇa mānuṣaḥ | 
īśatvaṃ nātra saṃdehaḥ ṣaṇmāsena ca labhyate || 13 ||
vivāhe gamane caiva kāle ca maraṇe tathā | 
avaśyam eva kartavyaṃ yogibhis tadupāsanam || 14 ||

This appears to be similar to the techniques found in early Tantric texts such as Svacchanda Tantra 7.268, etc. So I would understand chāyāpuruṣopadeśapariśīlanena to be one who is skilled in interpreting the communications of the shadow person.

Hope this helps,

Michael

How do I understand the expressions like chāyāpuruṣopadeśavidbhiḥ (Tantrāloka-viveka-3.5ab) or chāyāpuruṣopadeśapariśīlanena (Īśvarapratyabhijñā-vivṛti-vimarśinī, Vol.1, p. 159) or chāyāpuruṣaparīkṣāyāmityarthāt (Svacchandatantra-udyota 7.267)? Who are considered to be the learned people in the teachings of chāyāpuruṣa (chāyāpuruṣa-vid) ? I should be grateful if someone can guide me to the right sources or throw some light on 'chāyāpuruṣa'. You can also write to me off-list. Thanks very much in advance.
