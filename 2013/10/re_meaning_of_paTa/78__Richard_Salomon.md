Don,

Have a look at D.C. Sircar's Indian Epigraphy, pp. 66-67; also my Indian 
Epigraphy p. 132, for further references. It has been suggested (I don't 
remember exactly where -- this may go all the way back to Buehler's 
Indische Palaeographie) that archival copies of land grants were kept on 
cloth.
