while making (the sounds) ‘he ‘layo he ‘layaḥ’ suffered
defeat. So a Brahmin should not speak like a barbarian. For a corrupt word is
indeed a barbarian.”

Right, Hans,

This usage is also referred to by MW (ततो देवा एतं वज्रं ददृशुर् यद् अपः, " the gods then saw this thunderbolt, to wit , the water "S3Br.)

It seems to be the best possibility so far, but hard to interpret, always confusing this use of yad...

Thanks to all

Dear All,

A clue as to how to interpret yad apazabdaHmay lie in the morphology of apabhASitavai, which is a Vedic formation; not also the Vedic particles ha vai. This may make it possible to interpret the passage mleccho ha vai eSo yad apazabdaHas an instance of what I have termed the "invariable yad-construction" (see the grammatical notes in my UpaniSadic Reader); so the translation would be something like this 'That indeed is barbarous [taking mlecchaas adjective], namely/viz. incorrect speech.'

All the best,

Hans Henrich Hock

One might think, Nāgeśa said, that the word mleccha would usually refer to a person or a place; how could it refer to a bad word? But in this case it is a term of criticism. "A bad word (apaśabda) is really despicable (mleccha)."
