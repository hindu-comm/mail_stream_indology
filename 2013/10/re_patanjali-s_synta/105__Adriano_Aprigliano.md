Dear Andrew,

Yes, I think it works. I feel insecure about the causal nature of ha, though. 

Also by applying this value of vai as topic marker, wouldn't eṣaḥ –not apaśabdaḥ— be on the predicate spot, since [yad apaśabadaḥ] should be a predicate in apposition to an already given predicate?

I don't know If I could made made myself clear...

I keep thinking.

Best wishes
Adriano

But if that is so, how to account, syntactically, for yad being in between eṣaḥ and apaśabdaḥ in the original text? Would it be possible with eṣaḥ as an adjective pronoun?

>> Dear colleague, If I understand you properly, you consider that the expected form should be yaḥ, construed with apaśabdaḥ, hence the syntactic problem.  On the other hand, yad can be adverbial, equivalent to yasmāt.  This is the syntax given in the Sūktiratnākara (ed. Vaman Shastri Bhagavat, p. 44.5-6): हवैशब्दौ प्रसिद्धिवाचकौ । यद् यस्मादेषोऽपशब्दो म्लेच्छो म्लेच्छतयातिप्रसिद्ध इत्यर्थः।
