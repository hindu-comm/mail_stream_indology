This exact point was discussed in the Pradīpa and clarified further in the
Uddyota.   One might think, Nāgeśa said, that the word mleccha would
usually refer to a person or a place; how could it refer to a bad word?
But in this case it is a term of criticism.  "A bad word (apaśabda) is
really despicable (mleccha)."

("Bad word" is of course probably not one's final choice for translating *
apaśabda.*)
