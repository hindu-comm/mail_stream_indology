Dear list,

I have come across several references to Rāmānandī's studying Yoga Upaniṣad-s as key texts (Ramdas Lamb, for instance in his article on the Rāmānandī's for Gerald Larson's festschrift). So far I have been unable to confirm which Upaniṣad-s they consider significant.

I would be very grateful to be pointed to more information, particularly which faction(s) of the order and which of these texts specifically do they utilize. Any help would be most welcome.

Many Thanks,

Christian Current
