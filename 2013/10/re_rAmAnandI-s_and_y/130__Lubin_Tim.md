Dear Christian,

The connection seems tenuous, but it is worth noting that Rāmānanda lived around the same time as the composition of the Rāmatāpinī(-Upaniṣad).  See Christian Bouy, "Matériaux pour servir aux études upaniṣadiques (II): La Rāmatāpinyupaniṣad," Journal asiatique 278.3/4 (1990): 269-326.  Bouy's 1994 monograph, Les nātha-yogin et les upaniṣads, makes no mention of the Rāmāndandīs sharing the Nātha Yogīs' interest in promulgating upaniṣads for their movement, which may count as a sort of negative evidence.

You might consult James Mallinson, who has done ethnographic field work among Rāmānandīs and has written about them (e.g., 2005. "Rāmānandī Tyāgīs and Haṭha Yoga," Journal of Vaishnava Studies, 14.1: 107-121 -- I don't have this at hand).

Dear list,

I have come across several references to Rāmānandī's studying Yoga Upaniṣad-s as key texts (Ramdas Lamb, for instance in his article on the Rāmānandī's for Gerald Larson's festschrift).  So far I have been unable to confirm which Upaniṣad-s they consider significant.

I would be very grateful to be pointed to more information, particularly  which faction(s) of the order and which of these texts specifically do they utilize. Any help would be most welcome.

Many Thanks,
