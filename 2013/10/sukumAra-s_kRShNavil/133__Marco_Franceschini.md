Dear Collegues,

does anyone happen to have a pdf of Sukumāra's Kṛṣṇavilāsa with the commentary called Vilāsinī by Rāmapāṇivāda? I'm trying to identify an incomplete grantha manuscript: it seems to contain parts of that work, but to be sure I need to check the manuscript against the edition.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best wishes,

Marco Franceschini
