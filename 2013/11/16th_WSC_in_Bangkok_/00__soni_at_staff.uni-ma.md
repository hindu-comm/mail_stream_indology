Dear Colleagues and Friends,
Most Conveners have accepted our invitation, so this update is now  
meant to make this public. The remaining ones will be added silently.

Please see the IASS website: http://www.sanskritassociation.org/index.php
under "News & Events" and click on:

"16th WSC in Bangkok in 2015
(Update November 2013)"

Or, go directly to:
http://www.sanskritassociation.org/images/pdf/16th-WORLD-SANSKRIT-CONFERENCE-Update-November-2013.pdf

We have also given the bank references.

We hope you plan to come.

Please do not mind the unavoidable plural postings.

With thanks to the conveners for their acceptance,
yours sincerely,
Jayendra
Secretary General.
