A more plausible derivation for *t**ēvanti*/*tāvantikai *would be from  the
flower name *c**ēmantī*/*s**ē**mantī*/*s**ēmantika *ʻthe Indian white rose
Rosa glanduliferaʼ*.*

The alternation of  the radical vowel between ē- and ā- would point to a
possible presence of palatal.  In Telugu, this flower is known as cāmantī, c
ēmantī or cēvanti. Irregular word-initial *c*- > *t*- is not uncommon in
Tamil and other Dravidian languages[1][2], as evident in the
transformations of the following borrowings from Indo-Aryan:

*sattva *ʻstrengthʼ > *cattuvam, tattuvam*
*snānam *ʻbathʼ > *tānam*
*samtati *ʻlineageʼ >* tantati*
*āsanam *ʻpostureʼ > *ācanam *> *ātanam*

Intervocalic /m/ > /v/ is well-known in South Dravidian.

Therefore, I propose:

**c**ā-/**c**ē**ma-**nt-i**> c**ē**mantī > t**ēvanti *ʻthe Indian white
rose Rosa glanduliferaʼ*.*

It goes well with the other flower names used for characters in the
*Cilappatikāram *such as *m**ātavi *(related to *m**ādhavi*).

Regards,
Suresh.
