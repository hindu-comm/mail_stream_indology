 *sēvantika *is listed in Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary as
well as in Turner's
CDIAL<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:884.soas>.


Problems with *devavandhyā *are several: Haplology involving -v- in the
Dravidian languages usually results in an elongated vowel (as *dev**ā**ndhyā)
*or a double consonant as in  *dēva-vacaṉam* > *tēvvacaṉam *(தேவவசனம்).
Furthermore, *devavandhyā *doesn't explain the spelling variation of
*t**ēvantikai
*and *t**ā**vanti. *Most importantly, a barren woman of gods doesn't make
much sense semantically.

Regards,
Suresh.
