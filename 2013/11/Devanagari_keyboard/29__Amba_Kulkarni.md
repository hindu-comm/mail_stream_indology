It makes sense to absorb 'a', if the language does not have many conjuncts.
There is a lot of saving in typing. We write कमल using only three strokes
'kml' instead of 'kamala'.

But for a language like Sanskrit which has so many conjuncts, it hardly
makes any difference. While you are saving on 'अ', you are paying with
'्'s.  I did a small experiment with Bhagvadgeeta. I encoded it with these
two different schemes. The one with 'अ' had only 5% extra characters than
the one with '्'.
