I think there is a lamentation tradition in Buddhism -- vilāpa. You find such a lament in nice in the Buddhacarita where there are two laments by the wife and mother. The Yaśodharā lament has come into Sinhala, and Ranjini Obeyesekere has published a book on it: Yasodaravata: The Story of Yasodara or Yasodara's Lament. Colombo: Godage International Publishers, 2005.

I have been reading Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian writers like Zhu Xi, who ridicules contemporary behaviors and customs as degradations of ancient practices, and I began to wonder about similar lamentations from India.  My question doesn't refer so much to prophecies regarding the cycle of ages (satya--kaliyuga) and their degradation into the present.  I'm wondering about potential firsthand observations that compare present with past and lament contemporary practices.  I'm clueless, and any helpful suggestions would be appreciated.
