  Dear Charlie & All,

I have addressed this tradition of feminine lamentation in the MBh., in 'Stri:
Women in Epic Mahabharata', p.183ff. (HUP, 2009; and Orient Longman, 2011).

  http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674031982

Margaret Alexiou has covered the cognate Hellenic field in her study of 'Ritual
Lament in the Greek Tradition' (1974).

With best wishes, from,

  Kevin.
