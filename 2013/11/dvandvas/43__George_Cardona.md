Traditionally, anekam of anekam anyapadārthe (Aṣṭādhyāyī 2.2.24), first stated after 2.2.23: śeṣo bahuvrīhiḥ, is considered to recur in 2.2.29: cārthe dvandvaḥ, so that a dvandva can be formed from any number of padas; cf. Kāśikā 2.2.29: anekam iti vartate |anekaṁ subantaṁ cārthe vartamānaṁ samasyate ... There does not, therefore, appear to be a binary bracketing.  Regards, George
