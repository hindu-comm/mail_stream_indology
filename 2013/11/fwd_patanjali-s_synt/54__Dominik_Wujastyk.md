Dear Dominik, Not just Kaiyaṭa but also other commentators take *mleccha *of
*mleccho ha vā eṣa yad apaśabdaḥ* to be a derivate with *ghañ* signifying a
karman.  And clearly they mean to derive the term from *mlech* with *ghañ* in
accordance with *akartari ca kārake sañjñāyām*.  They also derive *mleccha* of
*mlecchā mā bhūma* from the same base, but with agentive *ac*
(*nandigrahipacādibhyo
lyuṇinyacaḥ*).  Thus, *mleccha* refers first to a term (*śabda*) that is
indistinctly/incorrectly uttered, then to the speakers who utter such
indistinct terms.  Patañjali explains that *apaśabda *refers to what is
commonly known as a mleccha.  That is, emphasis here is on incorrect speech
(*apaśabda*) in the phonic aspect, identified with the indistinct speech of
the Mleccha ('barbarian' if you will), as is clear from the
Śatapathabrāhmaṇa passage comparable to the present Bhāṣya passage. I think
The Sūktiratnākara and others got this right.  The contested issue of the
syntax is, to my mind. not so clear as some have made it.
​[...]
I don't know whether this is an improvement, but it my two cents for the
moment.  Yours, George

I'm still nagging at what Kaiyaṭa means by "karmaṇi ghañ".  My present best
idea is that he's invoking P.3.3.19 *akartari ca kārake saṃjñāyām*.  This
implies an origin from *mlich*, which is odd, but can be ignored, I think.
So "*mleccha*" is the recipient of the action.  This may explain the future
pass. part. that Nāgeśa uses, *nindyā* "to *be* blamed" (passive).  *Mleccha
* = "despicable", i.e., it is the *recipient* of criticism.  And P.3.3.19
makes "*mleccha*" a *saṃjñā*, which is right too. (I don't believe that P.
meant *ca* to negate *saṃjñāyām*, even if this *ghañ* is desired in non-*
saṃjñā* cases.)

I hope someone can improve on this :-)

Dominik
