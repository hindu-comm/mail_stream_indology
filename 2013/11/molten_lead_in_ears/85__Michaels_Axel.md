Subject: [INDOLOGY] molten lead in ears

Dear Colleagues,

Could someone please point me towards the reference where Åšudras would have molten lead or some other substance poured into their ears as punishment for having heard the recitation of Sanskrit mantras.

I'm wondering also what punishment would be dispensed to someone uttering Sanskrit verses or perhaps speaking Sanskrit.

All the best,
