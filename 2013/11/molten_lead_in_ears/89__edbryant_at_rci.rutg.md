Do we have any evidence outside of the Dharma Shastra prescriptions - in
Epic or Puranic or early Buddhist/Jain narratives, for example - that such
practices actually occurred?  One might expect that any such occurrences
would provide fuel for anti-brahman polemic, or be referenced in
literature undermining brahman hegemony.
