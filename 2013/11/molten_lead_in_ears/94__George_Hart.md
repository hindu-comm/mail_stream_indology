I think it is important to point out that in Tamil Nadu, perhaps 3-4% of the population is “twice-born,” that is Brahmin (since one cannot really find Kśatriyas and Vaiśyas) and that Nammāḻvār was of a high caste (jāti) that in influence, wealth and prestige was probably in many ways superior to the Brahmins.  It is true that the Śrīvaiṣṇava Brahmins (Iyengars) consider Nammāḻvār a Śudra (along with 96% of the rest of the population), but that does not keep them from regarding his works as the Tamil Vedas, in every way as holy and respected as the Sanskrit Vedas.
