Here is a possible translation of the first Tamil sentence:


(The manuscript which) Cuppaḷam Kesavan wrote and tied/bundled or completed in the year 1039 (of the Kollam era) on the fifth day of the month of Kārttikai.


Is it possible mukiñcatu is really mutiñcatu? It could mean tied/bundled or completed.


The name Cuppaḷam is interesting linguistically. There is a place called Uppaḷam near Colachel in Kanyakumari district. Uppaḷam means salt pan. If the name Cuppaḷam was still prevalent in the 19th century, this might be an instance of an existence of PDr. Cuppu in this compound in Tamil even up to 19th century!


Normally Grantha will be Tamilized as kirantam. Here it seems to be kurantam


The text seems to be dealing with arkāṇipāṭha of the 14th Sāma, 6th khaṇḍa.  


Hope this helps


Regards,
Palaniappan

Subject: [INDOLOGY] unidentified Grantha manuscript



Dear Collegues,


I'm desperately trying to find out which text is contained in a manuscript that I'm currently cataloguing.


The manuscript (belonging to the Cambridge UL collection) is written in Grantha script. The text appears to be composed of four pāṭhas, called arkāṇi, vratāni, dundu, śuklāṇi: the pāṭhas are organized into sections called (from the larger to the smaller) khaṇḍa, sāma, mantra (this last always abbreviated as ma.).


The beginning of the text runs like this:



om vāco vṛte dve | huve vācām | tī | vācaṃ vācaṃ huve vāk | ṭhya ṭya ta śa | śṛṇotu śrṇotu vāg vāk | hyī dya ta śa | samai tu samai tu vāg vāk | re | ramatāṃ ramatāṃ ramātā au ho vā | kilu khaśi | ihā ihā ihā | tū | sāmaṃ | 1 | huvā ivā cāṃ | ṭī ca | vācaṃ huvā i | kāc cā śa | vāk | ta śa | śrṇotu śṛṇotū vāg vāk | cāśa cāka phaplata śa |
---


The explicit runs like this:


śukroṃ | cā | śukra ho i | dviḥ | śukra hā ā uvā | ṭyu ṭya | e bhrā Xā bhrājā | tac ka ṭya kha | ma | 40 | prājāpatyaṃ gāyatraṃ prājāpatyaṃ gāyatraṃ | tat savitur pareṇyoṃ | ca śrū | bhargo devasya dhimāhāṃ ī dhiyo yo nāḥ prācārhaṃ bhā o vā | ṭyṛc kaṭyi saṭ caśaka | ṭya ṭyac | ovā huṃ bhā | saṭ ac ṭya | o vā | cā | 41 |

---


Final rubric:


śuklāṇi pāṭhasamāptaḥ | hari om | ity āraṇapāṭhasamāptaḥ | śubham astu śrīgurubhyo namaḥ |
---


Colophon (in Tamil language and script, added by a different hand):



cuppaḷam kesavaṉ āraṇakurantaṃ 1039 ām ta kārttika mācam 5 til eḻuti mukiñcatu
---


The words cuppaḷam kesavaṉ āraṇakurantaṃ recur also in the final rubric of the arkāṇipāṭha:



sāmaṃ 14 | khaṇḍaṃ 6 | arkāṇipāṭha samāptaḥ | cuppaḷam kesavaṉ āraṇakurenatam |
---



The title seems to be "Āraṇakurantam (= Āraṇya-grantha?) of Kesavaṉ", but I can't find any text bearing such a title (or a similar one) in any catalogue nor in the internet. Any suggestion will be highly appreciated!


Many thanks in advance,


Marco Franceschini
