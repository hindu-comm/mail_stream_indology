I can confirm that this is a complete manuscript of the Āraṇyaka Gāna
of the Jaiminīya Sāmaveda, from the beginning of the Vrata parvan to
the end of the Prājāpatyaṃ gāyatram, which is the final sāman.
In the beginning, read vrate instead of vṛte. The seventh syllable tī
is Jaiminīya svara notation.

The manuscript must be from the Kanyakumari District, where there still
are Tamil Jaiminīyas, as Masato Fujii and I could find out in our search
for Jaiminīya manuscripts. They would naturally use the grantha script but
also the Kollam era of Kerala. In grantha, u and cu are not too different,
so probably you have to read Uppaḷam mentioned by Palaniappan instead of
Cuppaḷam.

Are there any other manuscripts of the Jaiminīya Sāmaveda in Cambridge,
and is there any information of the provenance of this manuscript?
Who has presented it, and when?


With best regards, Asko Parpola
