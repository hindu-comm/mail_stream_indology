Dear Palaniappan,

Thanks for the Tamil Translation.

Isn't mu-k- 'to end, terminate' *[DEDR 4891
<http://kolichala.com/DEDR/search.php?q=4891&esb=1>]* is different
from muṭi 'tie/bundle' *[DEDR 4921
<http://kolichala.com/DEDR/searchindexid.php?q=4921&esb=1>] **(*Also see*
[DEDR 4922 <http://kolichala.com/DEDR/search.php?q=4922&esb=1>]). *May be,
they are all related to **mū-y* 'to end'. In Telugu, it is not uncommon to
find the phrase "mugiñcinadi" in such inscriptions.

Yes. That would be very interesting. But as Parpola says, could it be
simply the case of a Grantha u- mistaken for cu-? In Andhra Pradesh, there
are several place names associated with uppV-, such as uppala-pāḍu (20
different locations), uppalūru (Krishna and Cudappah Dist.) uppalam
(Srikakulam Dist), pedauppalam (Visakhapatnam Dist) and Uppal
(Hyderabad/Rangareddi Dist) but nothing that starts with cupp-/supp-.

Regards,
Suresh.
