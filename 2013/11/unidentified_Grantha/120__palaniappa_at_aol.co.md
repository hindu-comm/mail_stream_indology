Sorry, when I said Kollam era was in use in Tirunelveli district, I meant the old undivided Tirunelveli district which included the present Tuticorin district.

Suresh,


You are right. The Tamil Lexicon gives the following entry.


முகி¹-தல் muki-
, 4 v. intr. cf. முடி-. [T. mugiyu, K. mugi.] To end, terminate; to be finished; முடிதல். முகியாத பகுதி புருடர் (திருப்பு. 681).


So we can just take it as mukiñcatu 'finished'. Here it means 'completed'. 


While uppaḷam is a common name, the important factor to consider is the use of Kollam era.


If Uppaḷam is the correct reading in the manuscript, there is also another Uppaḷam near Srivaikuntam in Tuticorin district. See http://www.onefivenine.com/india/villages/Tuticorin/Srivaikundam/Uppalam . The region between Tuticorin and Tiruchendur is famous for salt pans.


Kollam era is in use in Tirunelveli district also where traditional wedding invitations and horoscopes still use Kollam era.  However, I do not know about the presence of Jaiminiyas in that area in the 19th century. 


Regards,
Palaniappan

Dear Palaniappan, 


Thanks for the Tamil Translation.

Here is a possible translation of the first Tamil sentence:


(The manuscript which) Cuppaḷam Kesavan wrote and tied/bundled or completed in the year 1039 (of the Kollam era) on the fifth day of the month of Kārttikai.


Is it possible mukiñcatu is really mutiñcatu? It could mean tied/bundled or completed.



Isn't mu-k- 'to end, terminate' [DEDR 4891] is different from muṭi 'tie/bundle' [DEDR 4921] (Also see [DEDR 4922]). May be, they are all related to *mū-y 'to end'. In Telugu, it is not uncommon to find the phrase "mugiñcinadi" in such inscriptions. 


The name Cuppaḷam is interesting linguistically. There is a place called Uppaḷam near Colachel in Kanyakumari district. Uppaḷam means salt pan. If the name Cuppaḷam was still prevalent in the 19th century, this might be an instance of an existence of PDr. Cuppu in this compound in Tamil even up to 19th century!



Yes. That would be very interesting. But as Parpola says, could it be simply the case of a Grantha u- mistaken for cu-? In Andhra Pradesh, there are several place names associated with uppV-, such as uppala-pāḍu (20 different locations), uppalūru (Krishna and Cudappah Dist.) uppalam (Srikakulam Dist), pedauppalam (Visakhapatnam Dist) and Uppal (Hyderabad/Rangareddi Dist) but nothing that starts with cupp-/supp-.


Regards,
Suresh.
