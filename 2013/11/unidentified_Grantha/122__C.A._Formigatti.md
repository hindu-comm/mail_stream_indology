Dear Colleagues,

I will try to answer the question about the provenance of the Grantha 
mss in the Cambridge Collections. We have very scanty information about 
the provenance of most of the South Indian mss in the Cambridge 
University Library.  The ms catalogued by Marco Franceschini has been 
acquired by the Library between 1990 and 1991 from the book dealer 
Robert E. Stolper. It belongs to a batch of manuscripts which included 
also Malayalam mss (in Sanskrit and Malayalam language) as well as Shan 
mss, for a total of ca 130 mss. Unfortunately, there is no record of 
this acquisition in the University Library, and the only source at our 
disposal is a hand-list that only notes if a ms is "Shan" or "Malayalam" 
(sometimes a title is mentioned, but this is usually an educated guess; 
there is no mention of Grantha mss at all, and therefore Marco 
Franceschini is cataloguing and mapping them).

I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm afraid this is the only piece of 
information we are able to provide about this part of the collections 
(the provenance of other parts of the collections is better documented).
