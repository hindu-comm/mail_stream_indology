Thank you Dominik. Indeed, at least one question answered, in n. 12: transliterate प्रउग as pra:uga.

Best wishes,

Arlo

Dear Arlo,
Dr Anthony Stone was involved in creating ISO 15919, and I made a link to his pages from 


http://indology.info/papers/One can't get a free copy of the standard there, I'm afraid, although Anthony's pages are full of information and may answer some questions.  



Best,
Dominik
