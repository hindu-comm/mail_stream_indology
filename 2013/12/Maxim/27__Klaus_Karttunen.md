Dear Patrick,
it is true that cakora is not only drinking moonbeams, but also deriving pleasure gazing at the moon. But it is also claimed that in the proximity of a poison cakora's red eyes become discoloured (e.g. KAŚ 1, 20, 8; Suśruta Kalpa 1, 30–33). Could this explain your case? I have discussed the poison-detecting animals in my article, “Monkeys kept in Royal Stables”, Traditional South Asian Medicine 6, 2001, 51–61.

Best,
Klaus
