Dear colleagues,

Would anybody have a pdf scan of the following work handy?


  Dutt, Nalinaksha (with Śivanātha Śarmā, D. M. Bhattacharya, and Āryacandra). 1939. Gilgit manuscripts. Kāśmīrasaṃskr̥tagranthāvaliḥ 71. Calcutta, India: Published by J. C. Sarkhel at the Calcutta oriental press.


If so, I would be very grateful if you could send it to me by email or through wetransfer.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
EFEO/Jakarta
