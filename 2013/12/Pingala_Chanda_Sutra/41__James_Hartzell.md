Dear Colleagues

Might someone have a printed edition of the 1931 Pingala Chanda Sutra
published by Janakinath Kabyatirtha and Brothers, from which they could
send some information from the title page?
The archive.org version of the pdf has some missing letters in the
following section below the full title:
 Siddhānta.....tIrthāyanāmakena śrīsītānātha....āryyāyabhaṭṭācāryyeṇ.

Happy holidays to everyone
Cheers
james
