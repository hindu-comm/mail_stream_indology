A colleague of mine in Japan who has lined up a Japanese publisher for his book on the Sarva-darśana-saṃgraha wants to include some of the devanagari text but he needs to find someone to do this for him (as his publisher is not equipped to do so). Any recommendations of a contact for him who might be able to do the prep or typesetting for this?
Thank you.
