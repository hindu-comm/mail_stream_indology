Don't know about a Kośa reference, but the word clearly betrays a Dravidian
connection. See [DEDR 4796] <http://kolichala.com/DEDR/search.php?q=4796> and
[CDIAL 9996<http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:447.soas>
].

Burrow discusses this word in "Dravidian Studies VII", *Bulletin of the
School of Oriental and African Studies*, University of London, Vol. 12,No.
2 (1948), pp. 365-396 (See entries 259 and 275).

275. *meṭa*- m. a whitewashed, storied house, L. [Pkt. *meḍaya*-; Guj.
*meḍī*, *meḍo *an upper storey, etc.].
    ~ Te. *mēḍa *a house of two or more stories, Ta. *mēṭai *raised floor,
platform, terraced house. Cf. *māḍi*.


Regards,
Suresh.
