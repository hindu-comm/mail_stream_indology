This is new to me.

Many of us squirm at the price of Brill books, but there's a lot of good
stuff published by them that we would love to have.  Now there's a new
programme.  *If and only if your institution has a subscription to Brill's
digital products*, you can buy a physical paperback copy of their ebooks
for €/$ 25.

See

​for details.​
