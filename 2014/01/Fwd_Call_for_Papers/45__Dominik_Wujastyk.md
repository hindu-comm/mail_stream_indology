Subject: Call for Papers


To whom it may concern,

Attached is the call for papers for this year's South Asia Graduate Student
Conference at the University of Chicago. Its theme is 'The Self in South
Asia' and our keynote speaker will be Donald Lopez.
​  ​
If
​ list​
members could distribute it to interested students at their home
universities, that would be wonderful.

Thank you,
Davey Tomlinson
