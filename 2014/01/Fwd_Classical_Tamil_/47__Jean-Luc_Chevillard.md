Subject:     Classical Tamil Summar Seminar 2014

Dear friends and colleagues,

it is our pleasure to announce the 12th Classical Tamil Summer Seminar,
to be held at the Pondicherry centre of the EFEO from August 4-29.
Texts to be read this summer will be the Neṭunalvāṭai, one among the
Pattuppāṭṭu (to be continued from last year; first week), the
Pāṇṭikkōvai, probably the
first example of this important genre mixing Akam and Puṟam elements,
transmitted only in the form of illustrative stanzas in the commentary
on Iṟaiyaṉār Akapporuḷ (second and third week), and finally the rarely
read Jain narrative poem Nīlakēci with the commentary by Camayativākarar
(fourth week).

In case a group of five people minimum can be brought together there
will be a beginner's level too.


Please feel free to forward this information to anybody likely to be
interested.


For more details see the EFEO Paris web site under

Hoping to see many of you in Pondy this summer,


best wishes,

                         Eva Wilden
