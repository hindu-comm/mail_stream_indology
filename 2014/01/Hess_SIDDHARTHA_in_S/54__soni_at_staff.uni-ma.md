Message passed on to you on behalf Muni Sheelchandrasuriji:

"I am happy to inform you that one of my disciples has translated  
Herman Hess' classic novel "SIDDHARTHA" into Sanskrit from its English  
translation by HILDA ROSNER.

We wish to send a copy of this translation to Sanskrit scholars and  
Universities in Europe/America. Would you please provide us the names  
and email address of scholars and universities who might be interested  
in having the translation?"

If Sanskrit readers would like to take advantage of this generous  
offer and have a copy of the  translation please write to Muniji  
directly at:

With best wishes,
Jay Soni
