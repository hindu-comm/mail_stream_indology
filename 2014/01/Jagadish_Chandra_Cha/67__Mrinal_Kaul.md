Dear Dr Chakrabarti,

Thanks for your email. I am grateful for you tried to look for information on J.C. Chatterjee. I wrote to the list only because there is not much published information available on him. Obviously, we do have all the volumes of KSTS available in PDF including the ones edited by J.C. Chatterjee. Thanks anyway for your email.

Best wishes.

Mrinal Kaul

He was the first editor of the famous 'Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies' and edited seven volumes in this series from 1911 to 1916 including his famous book 'Kashmir Śhaivism'. I have been trying to find more information about him, but have had no success so far. From the volumes he edited it is clear that he was a learned paṇḍit and studied in Cambridge. He would surely have studied with the traditional Sanskrit scholars of Bengal before studying in England. Can someone guide me towards finding some sources about or by him? I am more interested in the questions of Orientalism and post-colonial studies. I would sincerely appreciate any help and thank you in advance.]
