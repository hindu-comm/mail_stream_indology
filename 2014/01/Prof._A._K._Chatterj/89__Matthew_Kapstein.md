Dear friends,

I've tried this once before, but not having received a reply thought to try once again:

Does anyone have current contact information for Prof. A. K. Chatterjee of Benares Hindu University,
a specialist in Yogacara philosophy who was himself the student of the late Prof. T.V.R. Murti?

with thanks in advance,
Matthew
