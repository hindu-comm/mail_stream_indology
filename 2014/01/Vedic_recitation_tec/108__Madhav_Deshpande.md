Hello James,

     I don't know if there is a technical term for this very common
practice, which offers the reciters some rest.  Often collective recitation
of the Vedas is called Vedaghoṣa or Mantraghoṣa, the term ghoṣa suggesting
a big sound.  Perhaps, this usage of ghoṣa is connected with modern
expressions like Marathi jayaghoṣa, a body of people shouting someone's
victory.  Of course, this does not specifically reflect any alternating
recitation of the Vedic mantras.
