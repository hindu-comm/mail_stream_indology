… but of course the English term is definitely just an Anglo-phonetic representation of brāhmaṇa, pronounced in NIA (Hindi, etc.) fashion with the final -a dropped.  The schwa quality of the Indic short -a- has led to a particularly wide array of transcriptions, using every vowel other than a, it would seem.  Thus, Wm. Jones's "Ordinances of Menu,"  or the old work called "The Christian Brahmun" (about a convert from Hinduism).  I find it useful pedagogically in undergraduates classes precisely to avoid confusion with Vedic bráhman.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Brahmin?

Dear Jarrod,

You can answer those questions for yourself by checking Monier-Williams,
where you will discover that Brahmin is indeed a bone fide Sanskrit term, at
least as old as the āraṇyakas.

See
http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0741-brahmodumbara.jpg

for Braahma.n, this would follow the modern habit of dropping the final -a,
since braahma.na is another term with a long history.

>From Monier-Williams:
