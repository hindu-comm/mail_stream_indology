on the social conditions, history,
culture, politics and language of 
modern India / South Asia (including
Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh). 
The programme is offered by the
Department of Culture and Society,

attracts visiting scholars from India and
promotes exchange of 
students and teachers.

We offer an informal
working environment and an academic environment 
that supports
cooperation on teaching activities as well as on 
research projects and
international conferences.

The language courses provide students with
the ability to communicate 
in Hindi and are a prerequisite for using
the available written and 
oral sources in Hindi. The language is
regarded as a tool for gaining 
insight into modern India, and language
skills are the foundation for 
research and teaching at the highest
international level within this 
field.

Society, 
where the object of research and teaching is the interplay
between 
culture and society in time and space:

disciplines of the humanities and theology to 
applied social research

- From Antiquity to the issues facing contemporary societies
 - From
familiar Danish cultural forms to other very different worlds
 - From
local questions to global challenges

 The departments goal is to
produce compelling research with an 
international resonance, as well as
offering teaching and talent 
development of high quality. The
department is closely linked to 
society, both in Denmark and abroad,
