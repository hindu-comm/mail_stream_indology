Dear Sanskritists,

I haven't been able to find a reference in Pāṇini  grammar for a verse
utilising a grammatical pun. The pun involves turning *ma* into *sa*.

Our teachers are indeed the most accomplished grammarians
who can substitute equality (*samatā*) for ownership (*mamatā*),
turning *mamatā* into *samatā*.
They have the best grammar.

सुतरां गुरवोऽस्माकं वैयाकरणसत्तमाः ।
आदिश्य ममतास्थाने समतां साधयन्ति ये ॥९॥

sutarāṁ guravo'smākaṁ vaiyākaraṇasattamāḥ  |
ādiśya mamatāsthāne samatāṁ sādhayanti ye  ||9||

I would be grateful for any help.
Many thanks,
Jennifer Cover (PhD)
Sydney
