Hello Jennifer,

     I looked up the verse and its commentary (Bodhasāra of Narahari,
Banaras Sanskrit Series, edn, p. 63).  It appears to me that referring
Gurus who replace mamatā with samatā, the verse is poetically calling the
Gurus the best of Grammarians.  The verse is using the grammatical trope of
instituting a replacement (ādeśa) in the place of (sthāna) something.  The
process of replacement effectively removes the original and brings into
existence the replacement.  Patañjali defines the original (sthānin) as yaḥ
bhūtvā na bhavati, and ādeśa "replacement" as yaḥ abhūtvā bhavati.
 Narahari's verse is not referring to any actual grammatical rule that
replaces "ma" with "sa", but is simply referring to the idea of replacement
in the grammar.  At least that is what it seems to be.
