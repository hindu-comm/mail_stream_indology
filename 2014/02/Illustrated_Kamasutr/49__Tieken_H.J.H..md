As far as I know there are no illustrated mss of the Kamasutra. If I remember well, the illustrations in Wendy Doniger's translation were taken from a medical (!) treatise. How can one possibly illustrate a list of the 20 ways why one would seduce another man's wife (it almost sounds like the Paul Simon song "57 ways to end a marriage" ) ?

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Illustrated Kamasutra

Dear Colleagues,

I have been asked by a colleague, without being able to provide a clear answer, about the date of the earliest Kamasutra manuscripts with erotic illustrations or simply erotic illustrations derived from the Kamasutra.
Has anybody ideas and, even better, references to share?

With very best wishes.
