My thanks to Michael Witzel, Madhav Deshpande and George Cardona for 
sharing their views and experiences. It's a sorry situation indeed. The 
Sarasvati Bhavan Library catalogue includes some 120 MSS of 15 different 
texts relevant to my current research, some of them very rare -- but 
apparently unavailable. The situation lends a new meaning to the dictum 
'pustakasthā tu yā vidyā parahastagataṃ dhanam'...
