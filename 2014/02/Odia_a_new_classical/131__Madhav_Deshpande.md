Hello Dominik,

Just for your information, an appeal to declare Marathi as a classical
language is already afoot, and the state of Maharashtra has appointed a
committee to prepare such an appeal.  I have seen some reports of this
committee, but I am not sure if there is a final version.  Shrikant
Bahulkar and Maitreyee Deshpande from Pune are members of this committee,
among others.
