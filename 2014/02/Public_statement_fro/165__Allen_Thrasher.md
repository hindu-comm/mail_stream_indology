As I recall, the British Indian law on this subject is discussed in the introduction to:


Publications proscribed by the government of India : a catalogue of the collections in the India Office Library and Records and the Department of Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, British Library Reference Division / edited by Graham Shaw and Mary Lloyd.London: British Library, 1985.

The British authorities were, I believe, worried primarily about riots.A number of the books and pamphlets banned were religious polemics rather than attacks on British rule.
