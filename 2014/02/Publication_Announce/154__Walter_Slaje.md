Description

Commissioned by Sulṭān Zayn al-‘Ābidīn to carry on Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī,
Paṇḍit Jonarāja was the first to compose another Rājataraṅgiṇī in
continuation. Jonarāja’s work covers the period of Hindu rule in Kaśmīr
from AD 1148 until its decline in AD 1339 (Koṭā Devī) and the transition to
Islamic sovereignty exercised by the Šāh Mīr dynasty. His account, couched
in poetical language, breaks off in AD 1459, the year of his death. The
latter half of Jonarāja’s chronicle focuses on the three Sulṭāns of Kaśmīr,
Sikandar Šāh and his sons ‘Alī Šāh and Zayn al-‘Ābidīn, whose lives he had
recorded for the most part as an eyewitness. The causes and circumstances
accompanying the Islamization of the valley from AD 1339 onward are
accordingly depicted in a comparatively detailed manner. The present
critical edition of Jonarāja was prepared mainly from Śāradā manuscripts,
which have only recently emerged, and from the pool of variant readings
reported by Srikanth Kaul (1967). It comprises all additional and
substitutional stanzas of Pseudo-Jonarāja and is accompanied by an
annotated translation that also includes a rendering of Pseudo-Jonarāja’s
text, translated here for the first time.The book comes with a
Rājataraṅgiṇī research bibliography, comprehensive indexes of contemporary
personal names and toponyms along with their geographic coordinates. An
image of Sulṭān Zayn’s founding stone of his artificial island (Laṅkā) in
the Volur Lake and four maps with historical sites of central importance to
events and personalities as portrayed by Jonarāja conclude the volume.
