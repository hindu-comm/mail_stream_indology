Dear Indologists,


Does anybody know the cultural reason why the Indian Navy's submarines are all named Sindhu- as given in the following story?


http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/navy-chief-quits-over-spate-of-submarine-mishaps/article5729695.ece?homepage=true

Five of, of Indiaâ€™s thirteen conventionally-powered submarines, naval sources have told The Hindu, have exceeded their design life. The INS Sindhughosh, Sindhudhaj, the Sindhuraj, Sindhuvir and ill-fated Sindhuratna, all Russian-manufactured Kilo-class submarines, were all inducted between 1986 and 1988. The most recent of the Kilo-class fleet, the Sindhushastra, was puchased in 2000, preceded by the Sindhurakshak in 1997, and the Sindhuvijay was inducted in 1991.


Thanks


Regards,
Palaniappan
