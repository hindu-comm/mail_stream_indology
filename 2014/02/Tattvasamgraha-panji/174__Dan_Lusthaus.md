Dear colleagues,

Does anyone know where I can find an e-copy of a Sanskrit edition 
Kamalaśīla's Tattvasamgraha-pañjikā? I know the grammatically parsed version 
of Śāntarakṣita's root verses on GRETIL but have been unable to find an 
e-version of the pañjikā. Even a PDF would be ok, but if there is a 
searchable romanized version, that would be ideal.

Thank you.

Dan Lusthaus
