Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Wendy Doniger's book to be withdrawn in India by Penguin India

Here is a link to the copy of the original legal notice sent by Dina Nath Batra to Wendy Doniger:

http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?289468

Sad and worried to see the trend of publishers withdrawing scholarly works in the in the face of opposition from a few fringe groups. But as Wendy suggests, in the age of the Internet, it is no longer possible to suppress a book.

Regards,
Suresh.
