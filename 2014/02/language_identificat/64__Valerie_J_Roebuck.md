It seems to me that quite a lot of it , not just ‘liberal dubo toto suferanza’, is made up from Western languages. E.g. ‘Adythum’ < adytum, the sanctuary of a temple in ancient Greece. ‘…sicurah… non lasharay’ sounds again like garbled Italian (We won’t leave <lasciare you safe <sicuro?). In the final passage quoted, there is also a lot more material in the ‘translation’ than can be accounted for by the ‘original’.
