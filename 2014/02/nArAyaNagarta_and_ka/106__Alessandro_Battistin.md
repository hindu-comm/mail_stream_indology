Dear Members,
I am preparing an edition of Ānandavardhana's Devīśataka, with the
commentary by Kayyaṭa (978 d.C.). The latter states in the puṣpikā that his
teacher was some ekāyanasya acyutatulyamūrter ācāryanārāyaṇagartanamnaḥ.
Has anyone ever heard of him or has any hint about names ending in -garta?

Best wishes,

Alessandro Battistini
PhD candidate at Università di Roma La Sapienza
