While some Indology members took initiative in appealing against a law when
an author from the West was affected by the law, no action was taken in
such cases when South Asian authors were involved. I cite two cases --
Tasleema Nasreen and Ramanujan.  They have been banned, one exiled, for
their views.

South Asian affairs are under Indology.
