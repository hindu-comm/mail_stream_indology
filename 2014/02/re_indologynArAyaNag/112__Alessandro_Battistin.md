Dear All,
thanks for your precious contribution. All the MSS in my possess (both
śāradā from Srinagar and nāgarī from Pune) read -garta unquestionably
indeed. Still, the emendation -garbha is very appealing: besides
palaeographical reasons, the very existence of an ekāyana named
Nārāyaṇagarbha seems an interesting track to follow. Moreover, the date of
the Jayākhya MS, though not diriment at all, is at least not in discrepancy
with a possible identification. In the next month I will examine two more
MSS of the Devīśataka: this could help in solving the problem. I hope I'll
be able, sooner or later, to examine the work of Candradatta, and maybe
draw some interesting conclusion. Of course, there's still the possibility
of many (?) Nārāyaṇagarbhas, or of a -garbha and a -garga (granted that
-garta is wrong). I add, for the sake of completeness, that this Kayyaṭa
was NOT the grammarian author of the Bhāṣyapradīpa, but the son of
Candrāditya and grandson of Vallabhadeva (the commentator of Raghuvaṃśa,
Śiśupālavadha etc.).
Thanks. Best wishes,

Alessandro Battistini
