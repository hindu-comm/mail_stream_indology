Dear Professor Bhattacharya,

thank you for bringing up the interesting case of the dubious textual
quality of the Kashmirian Paippalāda-Saṃhitā.

The genesis of this copy can - as in the case just discussed of Muslim
obsequies couched in the language of the Gods - again not be looked at in
isolation, but requires to take Kashmir's previous transition to Islam and
the newly provided cultural context for Vedic and Sanskrit learning into
consideration. Here again, the post-Kalhaṇian Taraṅgiṇīs, Śrīvara in
particular, are marked representatives of an innovative Sanskrit
interaction with Islamic rule at Persophone courts and at the same time
constitute an invaluable source of reliable historical information.

Just for the records, I take the liberty of attaching a paper on the
history of the Atharvaveda copy:

Three Bhaṭṭas, Two Sulṭāns, and the Kashmirian Atharvaveda. In: The
Atharvaveda and its Paippalādaśākhā. Historical and Philological Papers on
a Vedic Tradition. Ed. by Arlo Griffiths and Annette Schmiedchen.
