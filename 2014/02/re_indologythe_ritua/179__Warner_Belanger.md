Of course. Here are the first two verses of the passage. It's from the
Second Avalokita Sūtra in the Mahāvastu.
The word kārīṣi occurs in five following verses as well.
This section of the 2nd Avalokita Sūtra is missing from the Tibetan
translation.
     dharmaṃ karitvā karikāradharmaṃ
     ārogyaprāpto care sarvaloke /
     praśaṃsanīyo bhavate janasya
     kārīṣi dattvā jinacetiyeṣu //
     akhaṇḍaśīlo ca ariktadhyāno
     prāptvāna sevāṃ dhanam aprasahyaṃ /
     ājñāṃ karoti bahukāṃ janasya
     kārīṣi dattvā jinacetiyeṣu //
