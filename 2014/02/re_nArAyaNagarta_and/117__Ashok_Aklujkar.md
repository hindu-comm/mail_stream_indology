Thanks to Tim Lubin. Yes. "ta" and "bha" are similar enough in some specimens of Sharada to be misread for each other. So, the point made by Prof. Slaje stands. 

I have checked as many words ending in -garbha in Einoo's book as I could. Yes, they would support the emendation to -garbha.

Helpful responses were also received from Tim Cahill and Bindu Bhatt. Thanks to them as well for clearing my doubts. I withdraw the suggestion to emend the text to -garga. Although that emendation would also have been transcriptionally probable at a certain stage, the support for it is not as many-sided as for -garbha.
