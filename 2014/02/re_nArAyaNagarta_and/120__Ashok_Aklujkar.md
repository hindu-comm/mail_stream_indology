Dear Elliot,

Thanks. 

I can think of only two reasons why I did not get the references you got: (a) I am not as good at carrying these searches as I should be. (2) Some references may be accessible only in the USA.

One addition to my last post: All personal names ending in -garbha seem to be pen or post-initiation names and the practice of using them seems to be current only in the Tantra tradition(s). Vajra-garbha, Candra-garbha, Puur.na-cid-garbha, Aananda-garbha, Kalyaa.na-garbha; ;Sakti-garbha, Aakaa;sa-garbha and Vetra-garbha, among possibly others, do not seem like names given by parents in the naming ceremony of a child; they are not similar in formation to the 'natural' names commonly attested in Indian religious traditions in general. Therefore, the search for Naaraaya.na-garbha, too, will, most probably, be based on a name given to a historical person in his later life in a limited circle

ashok.

Belonging to the Durbar Library, Nepal (Calcutta, 1905),. He mentions ekāyanācāryya nārāyāṇagarbhaḥ on page lxxvi and lxxvii of the preface. Alexis Sanderson mentions this same teacher in connection with the same manuscript on page 67 of Shingo Einoo, Genesis and Development of Tantrism (Tokyo, 2009).
