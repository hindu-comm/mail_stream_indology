Dear List Members,
I've come across a passage in a Buddhist text which describes the benefits
of offering kārīṣi at a caitya.
I assume that this refers to dry cow dung based on Monier-Williams but also
Turner's *A comparative dictionary of Indo-Aryan languages.* I'm not sure
for what purpose this would be used ritually. Would it be smeared on the
caitya or perhaps used as fuel? Could this word have been used for such a
reason instead of gomaya?
Any references or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
Warner
