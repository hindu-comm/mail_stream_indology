It is deeply sad that most researchers look for evidences only in Sanskrit! That’s alright but not absolute. 

An enumeration of a woman’s ornaments … yes, there is an enumeration in an earlier Tamil text called the Cilappatikaaram. If anyone would be interested, let me know and I’ll help them read through the text. 

Best,
Rajam

My greater effort is to show how Hindu wedding adornment in the U.S. uses wedding adornment as cultural capital and borrows from older adornment vernaculars. I'm looking for resources in English, Hindi, and Sanskrit as those are the languages I work in. In Hindi, I've seen solah śṛṇgār and various transliterations in English. I haven't come across a similar concept in Sanskrit, which would be phrased as some form of ṣoḍaśa śṛṇgāra.
