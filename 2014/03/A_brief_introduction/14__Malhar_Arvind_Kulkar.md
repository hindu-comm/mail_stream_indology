> Dear all

> I would like to inform you that I have just uploaded to www.academia.edu
> a very modest paper (unpublished), "A brief introduction into the Indian
> metrical system for the use of students," that attempts at summarizing on
> just six pages the very essentials of classical Sanskrit metrics. On its
> last page you will find a list of the 25 most common Sanskrit metres
> that saves the student the trouble to go through the long list in Apte's
> dictionary. Several colleagues found this draft (originally prepared for
> classes at UC Berkeley) helpful. That is the reason why I have decided
> to make it generally accessible. Any criticism will be greatly
> appreciated.
