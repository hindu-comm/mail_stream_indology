Dear List,

Bhagavata Purana has the brahmans churning at first the dead king Vena's
thigh and then his arms - in order to create a new king.

BhP_04.14.043/1 viniścityaivam ṛṣayo vipannasya mahīpateḥ
BhP_04.14.043/2 *mamanthur ūruṃ* tarasā tatrāsīd bāhuko naraḥ

BhP_04.15.001/1 atha tasya punar viprair aputrasya mahīpateḥ
BhP_04.15.001/2 *bāhubhyāṃ mathyamānābhyāṃ* mithunaṃ samapadyata

Would someone comment on the procedure involved and the meaning of that -
certainly - strange ritual?

Has someone worked on the king Vena's story? Any book? Paper?


Regards,

Artur Karp
