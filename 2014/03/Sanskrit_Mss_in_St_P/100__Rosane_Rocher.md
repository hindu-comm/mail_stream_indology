Many thanks to all the colleagues who responded to my query on and off 
list.  I found the Mironov catalog of 1914, digitized on Dominik's 
homepage, particularly informative, even for scholars who struggle with 
Russian.  The brief history of the collections and other information 
posted on the Institute of Oriental Studies (English) website is also of 
considerable help.  I am again most appreciative of our wonderfully 
supportive community of scholars. Every communication provided usable data.

Best wishes to all,
Rosane
