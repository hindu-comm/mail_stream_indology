The ritual of Ṣaṣṭhī with her cat, as is prevalent in Bengal, is not a very
ancient custom. The reference to Padma-Purāṇa does not help as it is of
late origin. One may consult D.P.Chattopadhyaya’s *Lokāyata* (1959).
Chattopadhyay has a full thesis and whether that is correct or not may of
course be debated. He considered the deity’s getting place in the pantheon
to be a substratum effect like that of many other customs. Chattopadhyay
has expressed similar view about the effect of Druid or Celtic culture in
Western Europe.
