Dear Edwin,

concerning Mīmāṃsā, the locus classicus is the devatādhikaraṇa (PMS 9.1.9). There is an excellent article by F.X. Clooney about it (1988) and some thoughts on it can be read also here: https://www.academia.edu/6263852/Between_Theism_and_Atheism_a_journey_through_Visistadvaita_Vedanta_and_Mimamsa

A further interesting reading is Robert Goldman's "How Fast Do Monkeys Fly? How Long Do Demons Sleep?" (discussing literality in the interpretation of Rāmāyaṇa's stories) in *Rivista di Studi Sudasiatici* 2006. You can download the file here: http://www.fupress.net/index.php/rss/issue/view/231

best wishes,

elisa
