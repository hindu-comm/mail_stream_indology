Dear colleagues,

Does anyone know the present whereabouts of this inscription? Can anyone furnish a (high quality) photograph to complement the attached picture of a rubbing published in EI 20, to help me as I attempt to reread this inscription with special attention to its palaeography?

Thank you.
