Dear Colleagues and Friends,
As usual, it is a pleasure to present to you the next issue of Vi-dū.

The poem translated into Sanskrit for the second anniversary of Vi-dū  
is an unusual tribute, and "is translated with a purpose of enriching  
Sanskrit literature with contemporary contents, themes and ideas  
written in a modern Indian language. It aims to highlight the point  
that Sanskrit is capable of expressing 21st century ideas with equal  
or more effect."

I trust you will also enjoy reading it.

With best wishes,
Jayendra Soni
Secretary General, IASS
