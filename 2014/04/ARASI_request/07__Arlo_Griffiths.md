Dear colleagues,

The scan of the Annual Report, Archaeological Survey of India, 1929-30, that I have downloaded from DLI (99999990229624) does not contain most of the plates. Would anyone who has easy access to the volume be so kind as to send me a scan or photo of plate XLI(e), which should show an inscription from Halin/Halingyi, in Burma?

Thank you.
