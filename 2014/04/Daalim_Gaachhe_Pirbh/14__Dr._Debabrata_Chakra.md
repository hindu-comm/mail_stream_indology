Dear List memebers,I got one rhyme in Tagore's collection of ancient Bengali folk rhymes, which I want to explore:"Daalim Gaachhe Pirbhu Naache""On the branch of the pomegranate tree dances a pirbhu"The word might have its source in the word "Prabhu" Probably this is the name of a bird, is it?  but which bird?Could anyone help me?RegardsDebabrata Chakrabarti
