Take a look at the Āmuktamālyada (http://www.amazon.com/Giver-Worn-Garland-KRISHNADEVARAYAS-AMUKTAMALYADA-ebook/dp/B008ET4CDU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398780659&sr=8-1&keywords=amuktamalyada).  It’s one of the greatest works, if not the greatest work, in old Telugu, and has a lot of information about ruling.  Srini Reddy’s translation is wonderful.  George Hart
