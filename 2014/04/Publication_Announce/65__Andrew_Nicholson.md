Dear Colleagues,

I am happy to announce the publication of my new book, *Lord Siva's Song:
The Isvara Gita*, on SUNY Press. I hope it will not only be of interest to
specialists, but also be of use in graduate and undergraduate classes on
Hinduism, Saivism, and the history of yoga. My editor tells me that an
affordable paperback edition will be available in January 2015.

A sample is available for download here:

Best,
Andrew

Lord Siva's Song: The Isvara Gita

Translated with an introduction and notes by Andrew J. Nicholson

Summary

A translation of the Īśvara Gītā, a parallel text to the Bhagavad Gītā that
promotes religious inclusion.

While the Bhagavad Gītā is an acknowledged treasure of world spiritual
literature, few people know a parallel text, the Īśvara Gītā. This
lesser-known work is also dedicated to a god, but in this case it is Śiva,
rather than Kṛṣṇa, who is depicted as the omniscient creator of the world.
Andrew J. Nicholson’s Lord Śiva’s Song makes this text available in English
in an accessible new translation. A work of both poetry and philosophy, the
Īśvara Gītā builds on the insights of Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtra and
foreshadows later developments in tantric yoga. It deals with the
pluralistic religious environment of early medieval India through an
exploration of the relationship between the gods Śiva and Viṣṇu. The work
condemns sectarianism and violence and provides a strategy for
accommodating conflicting religious claims in its own day and in our own.

“This is an excellent introduction to, and a sound scholarly translation
of, a foundational text. Andrew J. Nicholson is a first-rate scholar.” —
Andrew O. Fort, author of Jīvanmukti in Transformation: Embodied Liberation
in Advaita and Neo-Vedanta

Andrew J. Nicholson is Associate Professor of Asian and Asian American
