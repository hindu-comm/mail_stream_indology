Dear Colleagues,

Does anybody help me (rather send me a Pdf version) locate ecopy of the
Vishvasanskritam 48.1-2 (March-June 2011), VVR Institute, Hoshiarpur,
Punjab; and the Vedavidya 19 (Jan-June 2012), Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya
Vedavidya Pratishthan, Ujjion?

With many thanks and regards in advance,

Niranjan Saha,
PhD Candidate, Department of the Study of Religions,
