I am a little uncertain about the use of the verb sam+ā+yā in a 
commentary on an astrological text. The context is a disputed reading, 
one version of which prescribes adding an extra zodiacal sign (that is, 
thirty degrees of ecliptical longitude) in a certain calculation; and 
the commentator uses the verb twice, saying 'asmin pāṭhe saikatā 
samāyāti' and 'anayā rītyā saikatā samāyāti' (saikatā being 'the adding 
of one'). I'd be grateful for any help in establishing a possible 
technical meaning of sam+ā+yā in this context.
