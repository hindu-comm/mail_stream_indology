Dear List,

Here is the link to a fascinating program that was broadcast on ABC1, Australia on 24th March 2014. Titled "The Dancing Shiva" (an episode of the "Four Corners" program) it investigates how the notorious art dealer Subhash Kapoor, who is now facing court in India and is on the wanted list in the United States, sold several idols stolen from South Indian temples to renowned musems, of which a statue of Nataraja worth over $5 million to the National Gallery in Canberra. For information, the photo collection of the French Institute of Pondicherry/EFEO, was instrumental in helping the police identify some of the statues.
