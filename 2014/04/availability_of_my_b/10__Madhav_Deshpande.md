Many members of the Indology list and others had privately written to me
that copies of my book "Saṃskṛtasubodhini: A Sanskrit Primer" were no
longer available.  The University of Michigan Press had informed me that
the book was out of print.  I am glad to report that a 2014 reprint of the
book (with a few minor corrections) has just arrived.  I received my copy
just this morning.  So I am hopeful that the book should again be available
soon from its distributor, namely, The University of Michigan Press.
