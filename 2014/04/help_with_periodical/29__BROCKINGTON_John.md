Dear Colleagues,


I have found an apparently reliable reference to the following article which I am unable to trace in any British library. I will be very grateful for any help in locating it and even more for a PDF of the article:


S. Hariharan, "Some Sculptured Epic Panels in Gopurappatti", Damalica 2.3 (1973): 77-81.


The panels in question form a frieze on the Avan??vara Udaiyar temple at Gopurapatti and any other detailed source on the temple would also be very useful.


Regards


John Brockington
