Mataji Maharani Tapasvini founded the Mahakali Sanskrit
Pathshala for girls only in Kolkata in 1893. Since it was a residential school, it might come close to being a kanya gurukul. According to Rohini Gawankar, who
has carried out research on womenâ€™s contribution to the freedom struggle in
India, Maharani Tapasvini was born Sunanda Rao, daughter of Narayan Rao, who
was a high official at the court of Tanjore. Gawankar also claims that Tapasvini
was the niece of the Rani Laxmi of Jhansi and took active part in the events of
1857.
