Dear friends and colleagues,

It is with profound regret that I announce the passing of Prof. Dr.
Jan Heesterman yesterday afternoon. Prof. Heesterman was one of the
great Dutch Indologists of the 20th century and a wonderful person. I
am sorry to be the bearer of this very sad news to many of you.
