Dear friends and colleagues, 

I have been fruitlessly searching for V. Raghavan's article on the VidagdhajanavallabhƒÅ (called, I believe, by the same name). It was (acc. to  Sternbach) published in The Silver Jubilee Volume of the Sanskrit Journal of the Kerala University, Or. MS Library (1963). I would be thankful for any help (how much more for a pdf!) in acquiring this article.

thank you very much in advance,
Andrey Klebanov
