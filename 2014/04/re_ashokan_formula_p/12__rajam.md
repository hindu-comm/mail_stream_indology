Dear List,

Since I don’t know anything about the topic discussed here, I asked a Tamil-Sanskrit scholar friend of mine about it and he responded. I’m pasting his response below:

It is discussed here in this MarAthi site -

प्राकृत -
एताय अथाय इदं लेखापितं इमस अथस वढि युजंतु हीनि च मा लोचेतव्या । द्वादसवासाभिसितेन देवानं प्रियेन प्रियदशिना राञा इदं लेखापितं ।

संस्कृत छाया -
एतस्मै अर्थाय इदं लिखितम् 
अस्य अर्थस्य वृध्यै युजन्तु हीना च मा द्रष्टव्या । द्वादशवर्षाभिषिक्तेन देवानां प्रियेण प्रियदर्सिना राज्ञा इदं लिखितम् ।

Thus  he  is  disposed  to  be  "strong  in  arms",  because  the  front  legs  of  two  goats  sacrificed  during  the  asvamedha  are tied - "he  thereby lays  strength  into  the  front  legs" 702)  and  strong  in  thighs,  for  similar  reasons.  Before  we  leave  this  point  we  should  call attention  to  an  important  statement  made in  the  Visnudharmottara-purana  703).  On  every  anniversary  of  the  first  'coronation'  the  king  should  repeat  the  rites;  this  leads  to  welfare,  to  increase  of  the  country,  to  the  destruction  of  the  enemies  and  so  on.  Then  the  'inauguration'  has  become  cyclic,  annually  carrying  the  ruler  and  his  realm  beyond  a  difficult  stage,  and  recreating  the  beneficial  power  inherent  in  kingship [boldfaces mine, A. K.]>>
