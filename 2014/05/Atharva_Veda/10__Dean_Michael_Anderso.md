Congratulations to Joel and Stephanie on the release of the Rig Veda. I know they've been waiting for a long time for this -- as have we all.

Now that the Rig Veda is out it's time to ask: is there any work being done on the Atharva Veda?

Are there any new translations, perhaps only partial, or other scholarly analyses that can be recommended?

Best,

Dean
