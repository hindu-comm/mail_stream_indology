I have already written to Penguin Delhi, asking to withdraw my book from them because of their scandalous pulping of Doniger's book.  Now MLDB is publishing "Hitlar."  Has Indian publishing gone completely mad?

Even participants in the "Indology under National Socialism" debate don't really need a new edition of Kampf, surely.
