Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Hitler and MLBD

Dear all,

I for one signed the petition, with some doubt, but I cannot see why
it would be in the interest of the list to publish details of who
signed or not. MLBD has apologized and withdrawn the book. Can't we
now let the matter rest?

Sincerely
Måns Broo
