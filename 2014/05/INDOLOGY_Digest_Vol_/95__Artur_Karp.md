Dear Ajit --- and All,

Yes. This List is not the place. My sincere apologies, if anyone feels
offended.

However. Two things.

First. Gujarat 2002 pogroms are already history, and - being history - they
are legitimate objects of indological scrutiny.

Second. As a Pole I am extremely allergic to seeing Adolf Hitler's ideas of
ethnic cleansing propagated. In India. Or anywhere else.


Regards,
