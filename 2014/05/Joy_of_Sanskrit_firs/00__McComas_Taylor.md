Dear Colleagues


Thanks to all those who said such kind and encouraging words about our 'Joy of Sanksrit' ePub.


I am pleased to report that 'Joy of Sanskrit' is now available for Windows (with Azardi ePub reader). In response to users' suggestions, we have split the ePub into 1st and 2nd semester to reduce file size and download time.

Our next step is to improve interactivity so that students can record and listen to their own audios, and complete interactive quizzes within the ePub - coming soon!


Any comments and suggestions welcome


Yours


McComas
