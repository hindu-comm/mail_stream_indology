So who is here emotionally attached to a new (from availability point of
view superfluous) publication of Mein Kampf including since a few days for
the increased price of 25 Rs the DVD of a film about Hitler that is out
since 1977?
Geeft niks,
Jan

NB From a memetic point of view MLBD's (and Robert's) work is done: the
petition-publicity has been made and I am sure even now MLBD will get the
packet for you at your home address if you order it from anywhere in the
world.
