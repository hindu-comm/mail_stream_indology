As a belated result of the Tübingen Purana Project a digitalized version 
of the Narasimhapurana is now available from the homepage of the 
Department of Indology at Zürich 
(http://www.aoi.uzh.ch/indologie/teaching/textarchive.html); it comes 
with an index to the content of this Purana (as originally planned for 
the Purana Project and published for the Brahmapurana). The dates of the 
accompanying files are correct; it has been a long story, now history.
