WHAT I MEANT TO SAY WAS:   it is NOW out from OUP!! 


Dear All:

Perhaps this was already posted while I was away from Austin; and apologies for cross-posting.

The much awaited translation of the Rig Veda by Joel Brereton and Stephanie Jamison is not out from OUP in a beautiful three-volume set. Here is the URL:

With best wishes,

Patrick Olivelle
