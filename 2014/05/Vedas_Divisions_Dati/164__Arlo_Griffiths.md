On textual divisions, might I also recommend the following?

L. Renou, "Les divisions dans les textes sanskrits", IIJ 1 (1957) 1-32 (= Choix d’études indiennes. Réunies par N. Balbir et G.-J. Pinault. Paris 1997, II/487-518).

And perhaps my own article, "The Textual Divisions of the Paippalāda Saṃhitā", WZKS 47 (2003), 5-35.

Best wishes,

    Dear
      Indology List members,




      I appreciate that this may seem a basic question. It's so basic, I
      don't have any fantastic references!




      I was hoping for references to authoritative accounts of the
      division of the Vedas into versions (Rg, Yajur etc.,), parts
      (Mantra, Brahmana etc.)  and dates in English.




      I was also interested in linguistic accounts of the Vedas that
      might distinguish the earlier and later Vedas on linguistic lines.




      All help is most appreciated!




      Gratefully yours,


      Shyam
