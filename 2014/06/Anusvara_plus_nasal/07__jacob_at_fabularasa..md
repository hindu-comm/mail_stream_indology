Dear list,

I wonder if anyone could explain the occurence in some Sanskrit 
manuscripts (possibly influenced by vernacularisms) of adding an 
anusvara before a nasal. I have attached three examples containing the 
following readings:

Ex. 1: तंन् (तंम् before sandhi)
Ex. 2: महाश्मशांने
Ex. 3: दांन

Any suggestions or clarifications would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Jacob
