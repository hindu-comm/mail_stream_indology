Dear List Members:

I have tried to send a private message to Haru at his university address (Harunaga.Isaacson at uni-hamburg.de) but the server appears to have classified it as spam once or twice. Other messages appear to go through but I get no response. Perhaps they end up in his junk mailbox. Thank you for any alternate email address.

Elliot
