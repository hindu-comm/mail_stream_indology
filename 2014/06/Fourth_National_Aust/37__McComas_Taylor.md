Dear Colleagues


I am pleased to announce that the Fourth National Australian Sanskrit Conference starts tomorrow, Saturday 21 June, at the Australian National University in Canberra.


If you would like to send greetings to warm us up on the Winter Solstice (yes, it's winter here), I would be please to convey them to the conference.


Yours


McComas
