Dear list members,

Can anyone tell me the text from which the kAlikAstotram comes? (ideally
name of text and verse numbers).  My understanding is that there are
several different hymns with this name.  The version I'm interested in is
the one that begins:
kAlikAkAlamAtA ca kAlAnalasamadyutiH

Thanks,
