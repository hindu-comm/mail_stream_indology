Dear all,

has anyone managed to download Limaye and Vadekar's edition of the
Upanisads from the DLI site? I would appreciate a pdf, I cannot get past
page 30 using the DLI downloader. Alternatively, an advice on a better way
to download would be appreciated, Windows platform.

Kind regards
Aleksandar
