VOLUME DESCRIPTION:

This volume — the outcome of a workshop-cum-conference that took place
from 1st to 12th August 2011 in the Pondicherry Centre of the École 
française d’Extrême-Orient,— is an invitation to practise the
“archaeology of Bhakti” with the help of both textual and non-textual
sources.

Bhakti, broadly defined as an attitude, a strategy or a style of 
devotion — one that may be intellectual, emotional or rooted in acts of 
worship—towards God or the Divine, manifests itself through the personal
voices of devotees as well as through the collective effort that 
constitutes the building of a temple. The “archaeology of Bhakti” aims 
at correlating different realms of representation, such as texts and 
images, in order to illuminate the elusive, pan-Indian phenomenon of Bhakti.

The focus is on sources, agencies and layers. A special attention is 
given to inscriptions, which belong both to the realm of artefacts and 
to that of texts, and which help to distinguish royal demonstrations of 
Bhakti from local manifestations. In the realm of textual sources, 
“archaeology” is put to work to identify how literary conventions and
concepts have formed and been incorporated, layer upon layer, into a 
given composition.

After an introduction by the editors about the complexities of the 
concept and practices of Bhakti in the Indian world, essays by nine 
scholars explore the phenomena of Bhakti and their chronology from
different perspectives (textual, epigraphical, archaeological, 
iconographical). In the course of these explorations, the reader is
transported from the North to the South of the subcontinent, back and 
forth between Mathurā and Maturai.

Best wishes

-- Jean-Luc Chevillard
