Thank you Prof. Torella for your clarification. One point of disagreement
here: you say "in these contexts *saṃskāraḥ *always refers to the residual
traces left by “inferior” realities on the way of their being progressively
overcome", but we have a clear example to the contrary in Kṣemarāja's P.H.
sūtra 19 and comm, where *samādhi-saṃskāra *clearly refers to a beneficial
and desirable *saṃskāra.* But that aside, I propose a different
reading of *tatsaṃskāraḥ
*in the passage below, though not with full confidence. From everything we
have learned in this alchemical discussion (and following up the references
given), *drutarasaḥ *in the metaphor can only be the mercury, so here
*drutarasaḥ
*must analogically stand in for *cidrasaḥ *(or *prakāśarasaḥ*), hence the
iva. As seen in real-life amalgamation, the *drutarasaḥ  *indeed *ābhāti
kevalam *-- appears alone -- as a result of this process, having digested
the mercury. So Abh. is saying that *cidrasaḥ *is what remains, having
devoured *prāṇa-dehādi-dhātuḥ *(cf. *jīrṇa *here with *grasa,
alaṅgrasa *elsewhere
in the literature).  That leaves us with the difficulty involving
*tatsaṃskāraḥ.
*Since Abh. did not write *tatsaṃskārasahitaḥ *but easily could have done,
I propose that he might be using *saṃskāra *here in its other primary sense
-- that is, the *drutarasaḥ *is the "purifier of that (*prāṇa-dehādi-dhātuḥ*)"
since that is exactly what mercury does. But I withdraw my guess that
*tatsaṃskāraḥ
*meant "the impression of awakened consciousness itself" which Dr Torella
rightly called unconvincing.

But I think it cannot be true that *tatsaṃskāraḥ *here means "the
*saṃskāras* left by body, prāṇa, etc. [for the moment still remain]" as
Prof. Torella suggested, because the *turyātīta *here being discussed is
being contrasted to a previous *turyātīta *(there being two versions of
this attainment), about which it was said: *śūnyādi-saṃskāro 'pi asti, *which
is unambiguous. How can there be a contrast if the *saṃskāra*s remain in
this second *turyātīta *as well?  (Unless I'm missing some other point of
contrast.) I take the point that if one becomes *ekībhūtam sa.mvid-ghanam*
then there is no samāveśa possible, but I'm not clear that Abhinava
disallows this possibility of going beyond samāveśa.
