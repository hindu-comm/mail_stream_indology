In this context the perspective of Prof Romila Thapar might also be interesting. I am copying the links of her recent article below:

Best wishes.

Yours,

Many obscurantist elements were encouraged during the final decades of the cold war in the name of research into the true Indian tradition.    The enlightened tradition that saw its beginning in the 1860s in Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, R.G. Bhandarkar and others rapidly waned in the eighties when the cold war was in its peak. The present correspondent too suffered and was even mocked at for his way of enquiry by friends in the West who hardly saw the danger. Only an insignificant percentage of the Western Indologists has cared to sift the husk fron the grain. As you sow so shall you reap!

>> There is a certain view that the Mahabharata or the Ramayana are myths. I don’t see them as myths because they were written at a certain point of time in history. They are important sources of information in the way we write history. What we write today may become an important source of information for the fut­ure in the future. When analysed, of course, they could be declared to be true or false. History is not static. It belongs to the people, it’s made by the people. Similarly, the Ram­ayana is true for people...it’s in the collective memory of generations of Indians. We can’t say the Ramayana or the Mahabharata are myths. Myths are from a western perspective.
