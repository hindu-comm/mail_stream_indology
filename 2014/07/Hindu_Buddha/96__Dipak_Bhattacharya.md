The proposition suffers from anachronism.There was no Hinduism in the 6th
century BCE.
The Buddha (Suttanipaata 130) is reputed to have upheld the equality of man
at birth. Even if the Suttanipaata is not available, one may easily consult
the Sources of Indian tradition,1963:143. That was not traditional Hinduism.
