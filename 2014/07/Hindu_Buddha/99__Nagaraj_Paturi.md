1. The argument by the RSS person is not a newsmaker to the academic world
as the continuities between Vedic culture and thought and Buddhism have
been under discussion alongside the discontinuities between the two.

2. There were/are descriptions of Buddhism as 'protestant Hinduism' , as a
'subset of Hinduism' etc. by a certain strand of western scholarship too.

3. One of the main issues here is the use of the word 'Hindu'. Richard King
problematized this in his 'Orientalism and Religion' . But uncritical use
of the problematic term even in academic debates continues perpetuating
ambiguities.

4. Alexander Wynne's 'the origin of Buddhist meditation' and other such
works do trace at least certain aspects of Buddhism to Vedic culture
or texts .
