Some publishers like the Cosmo Publishers do not even care to reply.after
getting a book or a part of a book plagiarized. Even Government
publications are reprinted before the expiry of copyright and without any
assignment. I know that such things happen in Delhi. The matter came up in
the List even before this. Victimized authors should unitedly fight against
plagiarisn or robbery of copyright.
