"Yet he accepts the basic Mahabharata story as real history, in all its
supernatural abundance"


-Howard Resnick

This is really interesting. May I know the exact words used by Sri
Madhvacharya with the meaning 'real history' ? That citation will help in
tracing the history of the notion of 'real history' among pre-modern Indian
writers.

Regards,

Nagaraj
