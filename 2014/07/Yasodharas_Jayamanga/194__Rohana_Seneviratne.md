Dear All,


I will be very much thankful if someone could kindly either send me or direct me to a PDF copy of Yaśodhara's Jayamaṅgalā commentary on the Kāmasūtra. The English and German translations of the Kāmasūtra, already available as PDFs, do contain the Jayamaṅgalā too but I am after the Sanskrit original. We do have a hard copy of it (Devadatta Śāstrī's edition published in 1964) at Oxford but I wonder if anybody has got a handy scanned version of it, by any chance.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
