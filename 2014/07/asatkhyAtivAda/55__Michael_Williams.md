Dear list members,

I am currently becoming more interested in the doctrine of asatkhyātivāda
and its critique by later Brahmanical thinkers. The primary sources I have
read (e.g., Vācaspati and Citsukha) present it in a confused and rather
unconvincing way, and the secondary sources I have seen are threadbare.
Does anyone know of a good specialist study of this doctrine and its
origins?

Many thanks,

Michael Williams,
University of Vienna.
