Maṇḍanamiśra treats the Buddhist Asatkhyāti among four theories of error in
his Vibhramaviveka (5-27). Although he may not be seen as a "later
Brahmanical thinker", it is certainly worthwhile to consult Lambert
Schmithausen's edition, which is accompanied by a translation, a running
commentary, and a thorough survey on the subject. See there on pp. 93ff and
234ff.

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
