I’d be grateful for some elucidation on the following from list members 
knowledgeable about royal dynasties in medieval India, particularly the 
northwest:

In his Daivajñālaṃkṛti (1336 CE), the author Tejaḥsiṃha, apparently of 
Gujarat and belonging to a family of (former?) royal ministers 
(mantrin), extols the Prāgvāṭa dynasty (vaṃśa) in general and speaks 
particularly of a certain Vikrama, apparently standing in some sort of 
feudatory relationship to ‘the glorious King Śāraṅgadeva, whose fame had 
become the head-ornament of the kings born in the illustrious Cālukya 
dynasty’ (sphūrjac-cālukya-vaṃśodbhava-nṛpati-śirobhūṣaṇī-bhūta-kīrteḥ 
śrīmac-chāraṅgadevāhvaya-puruṣapateḥ…). My questions are:

1. I had understood the Cālukyas and Caulukyas to be two different 
dynasties, the Cālukyas being earlier and primarily ruling in the South, 
whereas the Caulukyas ruled in the northwest. Is there any way that 
‘Cālukya’ could be anything other than a scribal error here? (I have 
access only to a single MS of the text, but Pingree’s CESS [A3 89], 
based on a different MS, gives the same reading, without comment.)

2. Tejaḥsiṃha doesn’t quite call Śāraṅgadeva a Cālukya/Caulukya, but 
almost. I’m assuming that this is the Vaghela king Śāraṅgadeva, which 
would fit the time frame. Are the Vaghelas typically (or at least 
sometimes) considered Cālukyas/Caulukyas?

3. Is the Vikrama associated with Śāraṅgadeva known from any other sources?

As always, many thanks in advance for any help!
