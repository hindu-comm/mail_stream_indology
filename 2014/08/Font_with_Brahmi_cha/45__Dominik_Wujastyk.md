The Unifont glyphs are hideous to look at.  As you say, Andrew, it's really
just a reference font.  CODE2000 is somewhat similar (but without more
recent Unicode additions).  One wouldn't actually want to use these fonts
for rendering any serious written work. They just provide a blueprint that
designers of production fonts can use in future.

I mentioned Unifont because the Brahmi addition
<http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/brahmi/list.htm> to the
Unicode standard - that we owe to Michael Everson and Andrew Glass
<http://www.unicode.org/charts/fonts.html> - is something of a milestone
for Indic data input.  Similarly all the rare Indic scripts on which Anshuman
Pandey <http://anshumanpandey.blogspot.co.at/> has been doing such sterling
work, and for which he was awarded a Bulldog Award
<http://unicode.org/conference/bulldog.html> in 2011.

There have been some requests for help with installing and using this font,
from users here in the INDOLOGY forum.  This is not an issue for the font
designers or creators to address.  Unifont is a TrueType Font. This is a
bog standard type of font. Installing and using it is a routine task, and a
matter for your own local configuration of your computer.  Procedures will
be different on different operating systems.  You need to read your local
help files about installing fonts and keyboard input systems.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
