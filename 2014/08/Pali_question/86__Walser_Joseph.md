I was using the CSCD Pali canon and noticed that in the Sutta Nipata, the fourth verse of the Upasivamanavapuccha has the line: Ākiñcaññaṃ nissito hitvā maññaṃ. The PTS has, Ākiñcaññaṃ nissito hitva maññaṃ;

Is  hitvā (long a) a legitimate variant that appears in the Burmese version or the Thai version, or is it a typo?
Thanks!
