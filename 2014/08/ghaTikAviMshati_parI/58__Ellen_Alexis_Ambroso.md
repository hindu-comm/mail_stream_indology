Greetings. I was hoping the list could help me with a term that has come up in an early 20th century historical work that I'm reading in Malayalam. The term is "ghaṭikāviṃśati parīkṣa." The author is discussing a series of exams that were given to a group of scholars at an annual assembly - one on poetry, one on drama, and a "ghaṭikāviṃśati parīkṣa." Does anyone know about this?

Thanks for your time and help. All best,

Ellen Ambrosone
PhD Candidate, University of Chicago
