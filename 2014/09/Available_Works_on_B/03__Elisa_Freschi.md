Dear Niranjan,

are you talking about critical works on the Bhasya or further editions or
translations? If the latter, you need to have a look at Takahiro Kato's PhD
thesis (available on line), which contains a facsimile of van Buitenen's
unpublished edition of the first chapter of the Bhasya and, more
importantly, Kato's own, further improved edition of the same. See also
Kato's forthcoming article on jnanakarmasamuccaya in Bhaskara (to be
published soon on Indologica Taurinensia) and Kato 2010 (WZKS) on van
Buitenen's edition.

Best,

elisa
