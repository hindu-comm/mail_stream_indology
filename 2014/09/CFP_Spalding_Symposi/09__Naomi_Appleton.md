Call for papers: Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, University of Edinburgh, UK, 10th-12th April 2015. 

We invite proposals for papers for the 40th Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, which will be held in Edinburgh on 10th-12th April 2015.

The theme this year is ‘dialogue’, by which we mean discussion, conversation, debate, argument, and communication between and within the religious traditions of South Asia. Our purview includes both religions of South Asian origin wherever in the world they are being practised, and those of non South Asian origin present within South Asia. We welcome papers based upon all research methods, including textual, historical, ethnographic, sociological and philosophical.

Presenters are usually allocated one hour for their paper and subsequent discussion, and will normally be expected to pay their own conference registration and expenses. (The Symposium fee, including food and accommodation, will be £190, with a non-residential rate of £65. Registration details will be sent separately.) In some cases financial assistance for speakers may be available.

We also welcome proposals from doctoral students, who will be allocated a 30 minute slot, and offered free registration at the Symposium.

We are delighted to announce our keynote lectures for the Symposium:

Prof. Stephen C. Berkwitz (Missouri State University): ‘So Near Yet So Far: Sri Lankan Strategies for Superseding Indian Cultural Forms’

Prof. Uma Chakravarti (National Fellow, Indian Council of Historical Research): ‘Contentious Dialogues: Three Moments From an Argumentative Past’

If you would like to participate in this exciting anniversary symposium please send a title and abstract (maximum 500 words) to the Convenor, Dr Naomi Appleton, at naomi.appleton at ed.ac.uk, by the end of October 2014.
