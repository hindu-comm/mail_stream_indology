Dear List members,

Would anyone have the contact information of Prof. K Rajan of the History
Department at the University of Puducherry? Among other things, he is the
director of the excavations at Kodumanal. A phone/mobile number would be
even more appreciated.

You can respond to me off-list.

Thank you all in advance.

Best,
Borayin
