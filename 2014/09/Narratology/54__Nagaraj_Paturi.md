Dear Harsha,

https://archive.org/details/Dasarupaka has English translation of
Dhananjaya's Das'aroopaka which has an elaborate discussion on how stories
are structured. It is called Pancha Sandhi structure. Each Sandhi is made
up of a combination of an Arthaprakriti and a Kaaryaavastha.

Kaaryaavasthas: aarambha, yatna, praaptyaas'a, niyataapti
and phalaagama/phalayoga.

Arthaprakritis: beeja, bindu, pataaka, prakaree and kaarya

Sandhis :mukha, pratimukha, garbha, avamars'a and upasamhriti/nirvahaNa


There are other ways of analysing plot too in other books of Indian poetics.

Best wishes to your student.

Regards,

Nagaraj
