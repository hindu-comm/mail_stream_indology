Dear Dr. Patel,

     Congratulations upon developing this wonderful software that fully
illustrates the Paninian derivations for nominal case forms.  One of my
classmates from the Pune University in the years 1967-68, Pandit Athalekar,
used to produce such full derivations on the spot.  But alas, he is no
longer alive.
     With best wishes for your work,
