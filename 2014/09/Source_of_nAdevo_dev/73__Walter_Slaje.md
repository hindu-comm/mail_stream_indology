Dear Dr Ganeshan,

sure. It was not my intention to challenge this well-known fact.

The statement of Maṅkha seems less well-known (except for a paper I am
leaving aside here for good reasons).
Except for the overall subject of his poem, which may be called "Purāṇic",
the quote as such has in its given context nothing to do with any Vedic or
Purāṇic "tradition". It was meant by Maṅkha as a very personal assertion.
He reverts to it here and there on occasion because he felt committed to
this principle to the degree that he considered himself - and was
considered by his fellows - an exception to the ordinary court poet, and
even made this attitude part of his authorial intention.
It was therefore that I restricted my words about this interesting fact to "
*Maṅkha*" alone and did not talk about a tradition, as I do not know of
such a one.

If you, or someone else, could kindly provide evidence for a Vedic or
Purāṇic background of Maṅkhas verdict (~ ~ "Let humans not be praised by
humans, man should praise god alone"), which could be classified as a
"tradition", it would certainly shed some light on the originality of this
Kavi.

Thanks,
WS
