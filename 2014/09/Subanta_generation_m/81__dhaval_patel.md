Dear all,
Please find attached the test page for a PHP based machine for subanta
generation according to Siddhanta kaumudi.
http://lanover.com/lan/sanskrit/subanta.html

The code can be seen at https://github.com/drdhaval2785/sanskrit

The machine gives step by step derivation of words as per prakriyA
mentioned in Siddhantakaumudi.
Respected scholars may please have a look at it and suggest corrections
where the machine is off the correct derivation process.
Please send corrections off list, so that they can be incorporated.

"Documentation" and "Known Issues" are in progress.
I am attaching a sample page of 'rAma' derivation for ready reference.
