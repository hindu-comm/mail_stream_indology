For this the processor Baraha is useful. It is Unicode compliant and had to be purchased with Credit Card. The rules might have changed now, I do not know.

The numerical indication of the kampasvara, if one desires to show that, has to be created.  But normally that is not necessary. One can just indicate the circumflex.
