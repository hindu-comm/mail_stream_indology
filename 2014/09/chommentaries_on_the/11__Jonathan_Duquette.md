Dear Colleagues,

I would be grateful if someone could help me locating commentaries on
Gaṅgeśa’s Tattvacintāmaṇi. I am interested in the anumānakhaṇḍa (precisely
the appendix on Īśvara), and the commentaries thereon by Rucidatta (ed. K.
Tarkavagisa, Calcutta: 1884-1891) and Raghunātha Śiromaṇi (ed.
Nyayapodhyaya, Varanasi, 1906-1908).
