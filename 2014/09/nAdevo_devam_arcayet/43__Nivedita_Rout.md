Also, nArudrO rudramarchayEt is seen expressed in revert ways in early "Saiva canons and in later paddhati literature, for example: in Ni"svaasa uttarasuutra, 2.8.: "śivībhutaḥ
prasannātmā śivasyārcanamācaret"; in Sarvajñānottara tantra, 5.2. "śivībhūtah
supūtātmā śivasyārcanamārabhet" and in many "Saiva Paddhati literature -"śivo
bhūtvā śivaṃ yajet". Morever, it is a Vedantic concept of identifying oneself with Brahman (aham brahmosmi, so aham), and implemented in "Saiva philosophy as well in "Saiva rituals and worship as Prof. Nagaraj Paturi mentions.

This basic concept and the statement to that effect is found in almost all Saiva systems and the allied SAkta systems such as the SrIvidyA. But in all probability, it seems to be absent ( or not so prominent ?) in the VaiShNava tradition, especially in the PAncarAtra system.
