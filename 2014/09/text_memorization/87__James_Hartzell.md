Dear colleagues

Might someone have handy some references on the practice of memorization in
the Sanskrit (and Tibetan) traditions?  I know memorizing texts is a basic
part of, for instance, traditional medical education, jyotishastra, etc.
What I am looking for are good published studies describing these practices
(pdf's would be a bonus).

Cheers,

James Hartzell, PhD
