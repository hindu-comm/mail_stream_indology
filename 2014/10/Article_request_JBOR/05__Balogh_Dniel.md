Dear Scholars,
I'm pestering you yet again in hopes that someone might have a scan of 
the Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, volume 18 (1932). 
Our libraries here (Budapest) do not have it and I haven't been able to 
find this volume on DLI and archive.org. The article I need is by K P 
Jayaswal, pp. 17–36 or thereabouts. The title is probably ‘Chandra-Gupta 
II (Vikramāditya) and his predecessor’
Thanks for any help in advance,
Daniel
