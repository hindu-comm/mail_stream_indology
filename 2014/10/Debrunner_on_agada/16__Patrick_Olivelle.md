The "Register" also gives agada as given in Nachtrage to II.1. I also do not have the latter volume. But you will also find almost two full pages on agada in the Poona Dictionary, Vol. 1, p. 286f.

When it came to my notice this 1957 edition was reportedly unavailable in the market. I did not find it in the Internet too.
