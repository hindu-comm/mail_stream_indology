                                In India, for your intermdiate courses 'the
Kendriya Hindi Sanstan' at Agra (U.P) is the best place to study. In our
universities only from bachelor Degree to research programme should be
taught.

with regards,

Yours faithfully,


(Dr. T. J. Rekha Rani)
 Head, Dept. of Hindi,
