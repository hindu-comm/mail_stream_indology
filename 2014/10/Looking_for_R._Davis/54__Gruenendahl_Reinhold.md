Would someone be kind enough to inform me how I can get access to

Richard Davis: South Asia at Chicago : A History.
Chicago : Committe on Southern Asian Studies, 1985

No copy seems to have reached Europe, except one in Leiden (NL), which would probably take some time to procure.

Many thanks in in advance.
