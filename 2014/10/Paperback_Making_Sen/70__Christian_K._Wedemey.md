_Making Sense of Tantric Buddhism: History, Semiology, and Transgression in the Indian Traditions_ (Columbia University Press, winner of the 2013 Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion, Historical Studies, from the American Academy of Religion) is now available in an affordable paperback edition: http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-16240-1/making-sense-of-tantric-buddhism

The press has authorized me to inform you that anyone who uses the promo code “MAKWED” to purchase the paperback edition of the book from this site will receive a 30% discount.

For anyone planning to attend the AAR Annual Meeting next month in San Diego, there will be a panel on the book that will feature Gudrun Bühnemann, Ronald Davidson, David DiValerio, David White, John Nemec, and myself (quad-sponsored by the Buddhism Section, Tantric Studies Group, Tibetan and Himalayan Religions Group, and Yoga in Theory and Practice Group).

Best,

CKW
