As far as "Yogavāsiṣṭha" VI.126.4 (= "Laghuyogavāsiṣṭha"
VI.15.14) is concerned, the following publication is of essential
importance:

Jürgen Hanneder: "Dreams and other States of Consciousness in the
Mokṣopāya". In: Claudine Bautze-Picron (Ed.): The Indian Night. Sleep
and Dream in Indian Culture“. Delhi 2009, pp. 65–99.

Best,
Roland Steiner

> (Laghu-Yogavāsiṣṭha 6.15.14). The sense here is that it is extremely
difficult to become discerning. There are seven

possibly many births. The difficulty of a

innumerable turbulent waves, is a clear metaphor for the
