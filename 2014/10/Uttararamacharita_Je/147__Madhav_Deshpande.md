On the website [http://www.sanskritebooks.org/ebooks-download/], there is a
complete list of downloadable volumes from the series of books published by
Jibananda Vidyasagara.  However, in that list, while the editions of
Mahāvīracarita and Mālatīmādhava are available for downloading, the list
says that the edition of the Uttararāmacarita by Jibananda Vidyasagara is
not available.  By any chance, if you do come across this edition, please
forward the pdf to me.  Thanks.
