Hello Shri Gargeshwari,

The Library of the University of Michigan has an edition of Bhavabhuti's
Uttararāmacarita, with a commentary by Īśvaracandra Bidyasagar, ed. by
Kumudranjan Ray, and the listing says that there is a 1966 reprint of this
edition from Calcutta.  The library listing can be seen at [
http://mirlyn.lib.umich.edu/Record/001004844].  Unfortunately, there is no
digital copy available for this edition.
