I have found this one useful and fairly accurate (unlike many others that put in a lot of Viraamas) http://epandit.shrish.in/tools/IAST-DV-IAST/
But the devanaagarii will not be read properly in Word, of course.

Dear friends,



I would appreciate recommendations for a readily available, efficient and accurate


program to convert unicode Sanskrit romanization to devanagari. (Vedic accents

are not needed.)



with thanks in advance for your suggestions,

Matthew
