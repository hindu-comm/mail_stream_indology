Dear Prof. Prasad,

It is not clear to me what you are asking for.  If there are *printed*
editions of the Śūnya Purāṇa (Pūrṇana?) then please give the
bibliographical details.  Or are you seeking *manuscripts*?  In which case,
have you consulted the most recently published volumes of the *New
Catalogus Catalogorum*?  Works beginning with "Śūnya-" are in volume 35,
which was published earlier this year.

Sincerely,
Dominik Wujastyk
