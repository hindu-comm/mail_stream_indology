Dear list members,

Does anybody have any knowledge about the following works of Sankara? I
would appreciate if any body could supply me with PDFs of these works.


1. Hastamalakiyam of Samkara with a commentary  by Svayamprakasha.

2. Sastranirupanam of Samkara with a commentary by Saccidananda Yogin
(Nirnaysagar Press).


Best regards,

Niranjan
