Dear Donald,
it may be not exactly what you mean but you can find interesting
information in few jyotiṣa-texts dealing with HIndu rituals and children
and
in the Bālatantra by Kalyāṇa (approx 16th c. CE), or in other ayurvedic
texts.

Also, I would suggest you to look at the Mānasollāsa.

Yours,
Ales.
