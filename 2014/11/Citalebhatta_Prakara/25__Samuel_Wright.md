Dear Colleagues,

I'm writing to inquire whether anyone might be able to send me a
scanned/digital version of Citalebhatta Prakarana (Bombay, 1926) by RS
Pimputkar.

I've not been able to find even one hard copy of this title (searching
Worldcat and SAUC, for example) and don't find it in DLI.

Any help would be much appreciated -

Many thanks,
Sam
