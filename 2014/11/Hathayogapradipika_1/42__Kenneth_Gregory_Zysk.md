This comes as a request from a student. Any help would be most appreciated:

My question concerns  the Haṭhyogapradīpikā 1.38 which states:

The Siddhas know that as among yamas a moderate diet is the most important, and among niyamas, harmlessness (ahiṁsā), so among all the āsanas is the siddhāsana.

In 1.16 – of what is presumably an appended part – we are taught that ahiṁsā pertains to the yamas; so why this obvious inconsistency? Is there any scriptural precedence to this case, where ahiṁsā can be found within the niyamas?
