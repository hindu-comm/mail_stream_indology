Hi, Ken,

As I'm sure you know, in the classic Pātañjalayogaśāstra of Patañjali,
sūtra 2.30 lists five yamas, beginning with ahiṃsā.  I don't know the
Haṭhayogapradīpikā well, but Svātmārāma (or whoever) gives 10 yamas in the
addendum to 1.16 (or 1.17 in my 1972 Adyar Library ed.). So even if ahiṃsā
is a yama there, as in PYŚ, there's already a willingness to depart from
the classic list of yamas, doubling its size.   Another item has crossed
list in 1.17; thus śauca is a niyama in the PYŚ but has become a yama in
the HYP.  I'd guess that the yama/niyama (commitment/obligation)
distinction wasn't that well-defined by Svātmārāma's time.

As an aside, Buddhaghosa works with five Niyamas (or niyāmas).

In the Milindapañha, niyamas are mostly paired with saṃyamas (not yamas).
The lists overlap with Patañjali. I haven't looked at this closely.

Best,
Dominik
