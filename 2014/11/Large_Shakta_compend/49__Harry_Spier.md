Dear list members,

The Kulamuktikallolinī by Navamīsiṁha, a large Śākta compendium (NGMCP
Manuscript No. : 1-1675 Reel No. : B 120/6) has now been added to the
Muktabodha Digital Library.

With the addition of this new e-text we now have about 300 searchable
tantric/agamic e-texts (about 750,000 lines in total) in our digital
library.

The vast majority of our searchable e-texts have been data-entered by a
very small team (never more than four people and sometimes as few as two)
in Varanasi under the direction of Mark S.G. Dyczkowski.

Harry Spier
Manager, Muktabodha Digital Library
