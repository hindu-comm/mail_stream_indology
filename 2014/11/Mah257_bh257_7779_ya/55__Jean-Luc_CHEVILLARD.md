There is an interview of Pierre-Sylvain Filliozat
in The Hindu dated 27 november 2014.

The link is:

"http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/interview-with-dr-pierre-sylvain-filliozat/article6639706.ece?ref=sliderNews"

The title is "Paninian from Paris".

The interview contains three reference to M. S. Narasimhacharya,
in the passages which read:

«Filliozat studied classical languages in Paris, and Vyakarana and 
Saiva agamas in Pondicherry, under M. S. Narasimhacharya and N.R. 
Bhatt, respectively. He learnt about Visishtadvaita too from 
Narasimhacharya.»

«Someone like my teacher Narasimhacharya, had no difficulty following 
any of this, because he had committed the Sutras to memory. But if you 
are using a book, you will have a tough time.»


-- Jean-Luc Chevillard
