> I just relate some old anecdotes. We owe it to the poet Tagore that Bagchi translated the work into English. Lévi made such an impression upon Tagore that the latter requested Lévi to train Bagchi in his own way. Lévi and Bagchi became legends at Santiniketan.

> Ok, I worked a bit on the files (reducing the size, adding OCR [a rather crude one], changing the page orientations). You will find Vol. 1 under URL: <https://archive.org/details/BagchiCanonBouddhiqueChineVol1>
> Vol. 2 under URL: <https://archive.org/details/BagchiCanonBouddhiqueChineVol2>

> But the entry is currently processed by the Archive.org uploading system, so it may take some time to be ready. So look in some hours or the next day. When the files are ready I can add links from Vol 1 to Vol 2 and vice versa.
