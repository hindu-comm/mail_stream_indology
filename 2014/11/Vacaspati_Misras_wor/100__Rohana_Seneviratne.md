Dear List,

I will be grateful if anybody could easily remember the source of the following words of Vacaspati Misra. It must be in one of his supercommentaries but I was unable to pinpoint it.

'ekasmṛtisamārohiṇāṃ varṇānām asaty apy arthāvabodhe sujñānatvāt.'
[it is because of the easy comprehension of the phonemes which get on a single memory, even if there is no comprehension of meaning (from them)].

Thank you.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
