Dear List members,


I am gleaning information on these two Sanskrit writers.

Vasanta Tryambaka Śevaḍe (1917 - )
http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n85337685/

Brahmānanda Tripāṭhī (1932 - )
http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n88110544/


Vasanta Śevaḍe is a commentator and a poet who has written a few mahākāvyas, while Brahmānanda Tripāṭhī has edited a number of works by Śevaḍe. I do not know if Śevaḍe is still with us but I believe that some of you might know more about Brahmānanda Tripāṭhī than what the Internet tells us. I will be very much thankful if anybody could let me know any piece of information regarding them, their disciples/ successors or relatives.

Thank you very much in advance.


Best Wishes,
Rohana
