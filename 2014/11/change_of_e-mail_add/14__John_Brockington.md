Dear Colleagues,

On Thursday I discovered that my Edinburgh University e-mail was no 
longer working and subsequent enquiries have revealed that it was 
deliberately terminated, despite my having been given an assurance about 
a couple of months ago that it would be continued (this was in response 
to my request for continuation after receiving notice that the current 
period of validity was nearing its end).  This means that I have no 
access to past messages, sent or received.  If you have by any chance 
sent a message recently to which I have not replied, I have either lost 
it or never received it, so please resend it to my personal e-mail 
address, from which this is being sent.

Yours

John Brockington
