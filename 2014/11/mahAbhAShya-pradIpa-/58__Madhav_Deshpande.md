I have been reading the Mahābhāṣya-Pradīpa-Prakāśa of Pravartakopādhyāya
edited by M. S. Narasimhacharya and published in 1986 from Pondichery.
There is no introduction to this volume, and no information about the
author.  I am wondering if anyone else has come across any information
about this author.
