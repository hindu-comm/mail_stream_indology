Dear members of the list, 

being aware of how slim the chances for the success of my query actually are, I, nevertheless, would like to ask, if anyone of you may have a digital copy of this book:
http://www.worldcat.org/title/prayoga-pallavah-vararucikrta-prayogasangraha-tadvyakhyanabhuta-dharmakrttikrta-prayogamukha-paramesvarajhakrta-prayogadarpaneti-granthadvayatmakaparisistavibhusitah-visvesvaramisrakrta-prayogapallava-vyakhyopetah/oclc/311561933 <http://www.worldcat.org/title/prayoga-pallavah-vararucikrta-prayogasangraha-tadvyakhyanabhuta-dharmakrttikrta-prayogamukha-paramesvarajhakrta-prayogadarpaneti-granthadvayatmakaparisistavibhusitah-visvesvaramisrakrta-prayogapallava-vyakhyopetah/oclc/311561933>
or, in fact, of any other edition of the text known under various names as prayogamukha-[maṇḍala/ maṇḍana], prayogasaṃgraha, vārarucasaṃgraha, kārakacakra etc.

thank you very much in advance, 

Andrey Klebanov
