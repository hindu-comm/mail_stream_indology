Dear Indologists,


During medieval times, were there any prescriptions for the naming of female children in Brahmin families known for Vedic expertise with male members with titles such as sarvakratuyāji? More specifically, would they have names containing parts meaning 'captive'? Were there instances of Śrivaiṣṇava Brahmins who had such titles?


Thanks in advance


Regards,
Palaniappan
