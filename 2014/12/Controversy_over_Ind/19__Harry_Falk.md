Aeroplanes are not the only outcome of science of ancient India.
According to a south-asian friend it was PM Mody who in a very recent
speech said that cosmetic surgery was invented in India and gave Ganesh as
a prime example of it!

Does any one know if the PM was serious about this or was this meant as a
