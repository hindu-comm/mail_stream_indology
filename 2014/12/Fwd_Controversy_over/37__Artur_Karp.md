Trivia.

According to pandit Gurudatta Vidyarthi (MA in Physics, 1886; the first
ever Arya-Samaj scientist) Vedic rishis knew composition of water--- and
they could make it. In short: Mitra (oxygen) relates to two Varunas
(hydrogen), as in the Mitravarunau (H2O).

" Let one who is desirous to form water by the combination of two
substances take pure hydrogen gas highly heated, and, oxygen
gas possessed of the property rishadha, and let him combine them to form
water."
