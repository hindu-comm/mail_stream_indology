Sorry, looks like my earlier message went only to George. Here it is for all.

The other reading is found in the later and northern manuscripts; the important southern transmission in Grantha, Telugu, and Malayalam script manuscripts have Medh's reading; and so do medieval authors such as Vijñāneśvara, Aparārka, and Devaṇṇabhaṭṭa. Here are the manuscripts recording sabhā vā na praveṣṭavyā in my note (the small letter in front of the sigla indicate the script):

The alternate is given by Ku and Rn, but Ku acknowledges the correctness of Me's reading: medhātithinā tu sabhā vā na praveṣṭavyā iti r̥jv eva paṭhitam.

Thus Medhātithi, and Kullūka remarks medhātithinā tu sabhā vā na praveṣṭavyeti ṛjveva paṭhitam.  Doubtless, the apparatus on this verse in Patrick Olivelle’s critical edition, to which I do not have access at the moment, can contribute here.  George

>>> If prāpyate is construed as a verb of motion (in the sense ‘reach’), the structure has precedents; compare the structure below, which shows that with verbs of motion the goal is not always construed as object in post-Vedic. Of course, the parallel with labhate might suggest an interpretation ‘obtain’. In that case (i.e., if it is not to be taken as a motion verb), there may be a parallel in late Sanskrit (one of the versions of the Vetālapañcaviṁśati, perhaps the one edited by Uhle); unfortunately I can’t find the exact reference.

With the normal masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.  In Marathi, such passive constructions are possible: रामाने (instrumental) रावणाला (accusative) मारिले (passive verb).  This usage alternates with a more Sanskrit like passive: रामाने रावण (nom) मारिला/मारला (nom).  I am wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bhāve) constructions where the object shows up in the accusative case.  Any information or suggestions are appreciated.
