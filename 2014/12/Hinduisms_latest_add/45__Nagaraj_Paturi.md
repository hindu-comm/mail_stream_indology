Does a new character in a comic constitute an addition to Hinduism?

In any case, the character of this comic is well within the framework
/formula of goddesses made of deification of sensationally killed non-widow
women.

These legend-born goddesses or goddesses of mythified legends are huge in
number.

One of the most well known of them is the goddess Vaasavee Kanyakaa
Parameswari having greater significance for the Vaisya community of south
India than for others. She immolates heself when a king tries to forcibly
marry her.

Such goddesses are called pEranTALlu in Telugu and there is a very big
number of them in coastal Andhra Pradesh.

One difference between the narratives of the living traditions of these
goddesses and the present comic under discussion is that there is no death
of the victim overtly mentioned here. But going to S'iva and PArvatI can be
seen to have a suggestion of that.
