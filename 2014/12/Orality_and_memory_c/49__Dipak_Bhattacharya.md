Wonder but not unimaginable.

One can be fairly certain that the many characteristic features of the
Aṣṭādhyāyī , terse prose-- sentences without finite verb, not an essential
feature of contemporary ritual sūtras, obsession with brevity (lāghava),
enumerative ie non-explicative definition, almost total absence of
argumentation, the abridgement of material worth some thousands of pages of
discussion, into a few pages of 4004 sūtras,  can be explained only by the
postulation of an environment of entirely oral transmission of knowledge.
So at a time not later than the 4th century BCE. The Ṛgvedic teaching and
training could not be different.

The real wonder is that the practice continued even after writing material
became available sufficiently.
