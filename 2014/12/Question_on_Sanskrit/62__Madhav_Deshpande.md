n a Sanskrit work titled Nityācāradarpaṇa by Brahmānanda, on p. 2, I see a
quotation from Dakṣasmṛti:

आचाराल्लभते पूजामाचाराल्लभते प्रजा: ।
आचारात्प्राप्यते स्वर्गमाचारात्प्राप्यते सुखम् ।।

Here, ācārāt prāpyate svargam is an irregular usage, unless one assumes
that the word svarga is somehow used in neuter gender.  With the normal
masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case
form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.  In Marathi, such
passive constructions are possible: रामाने (instrumental) रावणाला
(accusative) मारिले (passive verb).  This usage alternates with a more
Sanskrit like passive: रामाने रावण (nom) मारिला/मारला (nom).  I am
wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bhāve) constructions
where the object shows up in the accusative case.  Any information or
suggestions are appreciated.
