Dear Dipak,

     Thanks for these clarifying comments.  The syntax of constructions
with passive forms of śak is very complicated.  Patañjali's usage of
"śakyam (neuter nom) cānena śvamāṃsādibhir api kṣut (fem nom) pratihantum"
in the Mahābhāṣya has generated long debates in the commentaries.  With
best wishes,

Madhav
