In this context, it may be noted that commentators on Manu 8.13 (sabhāṁ vā na praveṣṭavyaṁ …) also read sabhā vā na praveṣṭavyā.  Thus Medhātithi, and Kullūka remarks medhātithinā tu sabhā vā na praveṣṭavyeti ṛjveva paṭhitam.  Doubtless, the apparatus on this verse in Patrick Olivelle’s critical edition, to which I do not have access at the moment, can contribute here.  George

Of course, the parallel with labhate might suggest an interpretation ‘obtain’. In that case (i.e., if it is not to be taken as a motion verb), there may be a parallel in late Sanskrit (one of the versions of the Vetālapañcaviṁśati, perhaps the one edited by Uhle); unfortunately I can’t find the exact reference.

>> Here, ācārāt prāpyate svargam is an irregular usage, unless one assumes that the word svarga is somehow used in neuter gender.  With the normal masculine gender of the word svarga, svargam would be an accusative case form, and this does not fit well with the passive verb.  In Marathi, such passive constructions are possible: रामाने (instrumental) रावणाला (accusative) मारिले (passive verb).  This usage alternates with a more Sanskrit like passive: रामाने रावण (nom) मारिला/मारला (nom).  I am wondering if anyone has come across Sanskrit passive (bhāve) constructions where the object shows up in the accusative case.  Any information or suggestions are appreciated.
