I'm sure there must exist, though I can't offhand recall seeing, 
scholarly discussions of concepts corresponding more or less closely to 
'science' and 'art' in classical (and perhaps early modern) India. In 
Sanskrit, I suppose relevant terms would include śāstra and kalā. I'm 
thinking of contexts like the modern debate (which I have often heard, 
in English, in India) over whether astrology is a science or an art, or 
both.

I would be grateful for any reading suggestions on this topic.
