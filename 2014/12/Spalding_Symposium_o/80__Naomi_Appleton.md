Dear Colleagues,

Booking for the Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions 2015 is now open. If you follow the link below you can register and pay, either as a residential guest (£190 including a room for two nights and all meals) or a non-residential guest (£65, no accommodation, all meals). A variety of day-rate options are also available. Accommodation is limited so book early to avoid disappointment.

The Symposium will be held in Edinburgh, UK, 10th-12th April 2015, and will have the theme "dialogue". Professors Uma Chakravarti and Stephen Berkwitz will be our keynote speakers, supplemented by an impressive range of papers from other scholars. More information, including a draft programme, can be found on our website www.spaldingsymposium.org, and queries can be directed to myself as convenor: naomi.appleton at ed.ac.uk.

With best wishes,
Naomi
