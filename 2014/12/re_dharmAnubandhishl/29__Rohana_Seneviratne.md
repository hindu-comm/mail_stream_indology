Dear All,

I received a beautifully scanned PDF of the Dharmānubandhiślokacaturdaśī from Elliot Stern with many many thanks. I would also like to thank Prof. Madhav Deshpande, Prof. Ashok Aklujkar and Ms. Lauren Bausch for their kind help to trace the possible locations of this work.

Thank you very much all. With Elliot's approval, I will upload the PDF to archive.org and share the link.

Best Wishes,
Rohana

Dear List,


I am looking for the Dharmānubandhiślokacaturdaśī by Śeṣakṛṣṇa, which was published in 1927 as the No. 22 under the Princess of Wales Sarasavati Bhavana series. The usual places we find such texts do not seem to have it. I will be very much grateful if anybody would like to share with me a PDF of it.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
