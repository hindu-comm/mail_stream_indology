Dear list members,

I have a copy of the english version of Buhler's Indian Paleography but
this doesn't include the portfolio of plates and tables.

If anyone could forward me a pdf of either the entire book with the plates
and tables or the plates and tables alone.I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
