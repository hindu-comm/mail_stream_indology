It's quite simple, though not at all intuitive. If you type an f
immediately after letters that you want to conjunct to others, it will
conjoin the letters (this will not work with a succeeding vowel, obviously,
only with consonants).

There is a guide here with other helpful tips on using the Devanagari
QWERTY keyboard on the Mac:

Hope this helps!
