In a technical section of an astrological text (Balabhadra's 
Hāyanaratna) I just came across the expression iti prāñcaḥ, which I 
don't recall seeing before and couldn't find in Tubb and Boose's 
otherwise excellent Scholastic Sanskrit. Am I right in thinking that it 
means something like 'so say earlier [authors]'?

A quick web search for the phrase returned seven hits, one of which 
(Annambhaṭṭa's Tarksaṃgraha 
<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/nyaya/antsdi_u.htm>) 
does seem to contrast prāñcaḥ with navīnāḥ, in support of my conjecture; 
but the others were inconclusive. An old blog post 
<http://elisafreschi.blogspot.se/2008/12/longer-discussions-on-arthabhvan-in-bha.html> 
showed that at least I'm not alone in wondering about it.

Any clarifications or corrections would be much appreciated.

Martin Gansten
