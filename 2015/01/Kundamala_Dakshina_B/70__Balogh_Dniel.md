Dear All,
my earlier request for the Kundamālā edition has already been fulfilled, 
thanks to the swift and kind help of Professor Deshpande. I've located 
the reference to the Pratijñācāṇakya (here called Pratibhācāṇakya), but 
Dhruva appears to have been inaccurate. This preface does not say that 
southern alaṃkāra works mention this drama; in all probability 
Ramakrishna Kavi and Ramanatha Sastri are just referring to Abhinava's 
passages mentioning it.
All the best to everyone,
Daniel
