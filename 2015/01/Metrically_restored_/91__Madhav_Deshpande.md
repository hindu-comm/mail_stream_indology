It is not clear how much the tradition was bothered by metrical
inconsistencies.  There is an interesting passage in the Aitareya Brāhmana
that says: na vā ekenākṣareṇa chandāṃsi viyanti na dvābhyām.  Even by a
deviation of up to  two syllables, the tradition did not consider the meter
to be violated.  The text titled Vedavicāra (19th century) that I am
editing and translating cites this passages and extends it further: ekena
dvābhyām ity upalakṣaṇam, tasmād akṣaranyūnādhikabhāvena chandāṃsi nānyathā
bhavanti.  Thus, it seems to be that "metrically restored RV" is a purely
modern creation.  If the Brāhmaṇa texts were not bothered by deviations of
meters up to two syllables, can we be so certain that the authors of the
Vedic hymns were so bothered.  There is a possibility that "metrically
restoring texts" could be something like a modern hyper-correction.  Modern
reciters of the Vedas that I am familiar with do not seem to worry about
reciting a metrically correct text.  While they seem to show interest in
reciting the various Pāṭhas and their permutations, I am not at all certain
that they are scanning the recited text for metrical deviations.
