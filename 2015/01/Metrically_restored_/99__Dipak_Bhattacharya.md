Dear Madhav, I too am very glad to have participated in the discussion.
Every point in the happenings is still not clear to me. I learnt much from
the discussions. But I am also sorry that discussions already made in
Indian publications reach the West so late. These have at least been
touched upon in India, and also in Western publications organised by Indian
scholars.
