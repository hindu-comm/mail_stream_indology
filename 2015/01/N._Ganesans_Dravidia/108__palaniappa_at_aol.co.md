Dear Dr. Parpola,

Thank you for your clarification. 

You may remember in 2002, during the Harvard Roundtable on Ethnogenesis of South and Central Asia, when Bh. Krishnamurti presented "The Culture of Proto-Dravidian Speakers as Reconstructed from the  Dravidian Etymological Dictionary (DEDR)," Frank Southworth questioned the Proto-Dravidian nature of many of BhK's reconstructions, which were based on words found only in South Dravidian or South and Central Dravidian. BhK did acknowledge that Frank had a point. In your own paper you were right to point out that the cognates of *nek-Vḷ are attested rather narrowly. In the case of 'nakar', considering it a sole survivor from Proto-Dravidian is too speculative. The danger of assuming 'nakar' to be Proto-Dravidian is made clear by Tamil philology. 


Please see the Tamil Lexicon's entries given below.

நகர்¹-தல் nakar-, 4 v. intr. 1. To creep, as a reptile; ஊர்தல். 2. To crawl or move along in a lying or sitting posture, as an infant; தவழ்தல். 3. To steal away, skulk; மறைவாய்ப் போதல்.

நகர்² nakar, n. < nagara. 1. Town, city; நகரம். நெடுநகர் வினைபுனை நல்லில் (புறநா. 23). 2. [T. nagaru.] House, abode, mansion; மாளிகை. பாழியன்ன கடியுடை வியனகர் (அகநா. 15). 3. Temple, sacred shrine; கோயில். முக்கட்செல்வர் நகர் (புறநா. 6). 4. Palace; அரண்மனை. நிதிதுஞ்சு வியனகர் (சிலப். 27, 200). 5. Dais for performing ceremonies; சடங்கு செய்யும் இடம். தூநக ரிழைத்து (சீவக. 2633). 6. A furnished hall or place, decorated for ceremonial functions; விசேடங் கள் நிகழும் மண்டபம். அணிநகர் முன்னினானே (சீவக. 701). 7. Wife; மனைவி. வருவிருந்தோம்பித் தன்னகர் விழையக் கூடி (கலித். 8).

The noun nakar is attested from Classical Tamil times. The verb form nakar- is not shown with any old literary attestations. Indeed nakar- in the sense of  '1. To creep, as a reptile; ஊர்தல். 2. To crawl or move along in a lying or sitting posture, as an infant; தவழ்தல்' does not occur in Classical Tamil texts or epics or the eighteen minor works, the Periyapuranam, etc. The only remotely possible occurrence is in Tēvāram 2:19:11.3. Even that is doubtful considering the textual variants given in the Digital Tēvāram. (See http://www.ifpindia.org/digitaldb/site/digital_tevaram/INDEX.HTM)

So it is very doubtful if 'nakar-' has an ancient pedigree, let alone from Proto-Dravidian.

One is led to wonder if the verb nakar- was coined from the noun nakar analogically based on the pair of noun ūr and verb ūr-, which are ancient. See the following from Tamil Lexicon.

ஊர்¹-தல் ūr-, 4 v. [M. ūr.] intr. 1. To move slowly; to creep, as an infant; to crawl, as a snake; நகர்தல். நந்தூரும் புனனாட்டின் (பாரத. கிருட்டிண. 11). 2. To spread, circulate, as blood; to extend over a surface, as spots on the skin; பரவுதல். இவக்காணென் மேனி பசப்பூர் வது (குறள், 1185). 3. To flow, as juice from the sugar-cane; வடிதல். கரும்பூர்ந்த சாறுபோல் (நாலடி, 34). 4. To come to close quarters; அடர்தல். வெஞ்சம மூர்ந்தம ருழக்கி (சிலப். 27, 27, அரும்.). 5. To be unloosed, relaxed; கழலுதல். அவிர்தொடி யிறையூர (கலித். 100). 6. To itch; தினவுறுதல். உடம்பெல் லாம் ஊருகின்றது.--tr. 1. To mount; ஏறுதல். பாசடும்பு பரியவூர் பிழிபு . . . வந்தன்று . . . தேர் (ஐங்குறு. 101). 2. To ride, as a horse; to drive, as a vehicle; ஏறிநடத்துதல். சிவிகை பொறுத்தானோ டூர்ந்தானிடை (குறள், 37). 

ஊர்³ ūr, n. < ஊர்¹-. 1. Going, riding; ஊர்கை. ஊருடைத்திண்புரவியுலைத்தனள் (சேதுபு. தேவி. 43). 2. [T. Tu. ūru, K. M. ūr.] Village, town, city; வசிக்கும் ஊர். (தொல். பொ. 37.) 3. Place; இடம். ஒரூ ரிரண்டஃக மாயிற்றென்று (சீவக. 2087). 4. Resident population; ஊரிலுள்ளார். ஊரு மயலுஞ் சேரியோரும் (இலக். வி. 563). 5. Halo round the sun or moon; சந்திரசூரியரைச் சூழும் பரிவேடம். செங்கதிர் தங்குவதோ ரூருற்றது (கம்பரா. சரபங். 9)

Indeed Akanāṉūṟu 306. 6 has a tortoise moving slowly up a sugarcane. If you compare the verbs nakar- and ūr-, one can see the semantic equivalence. The verb ūr-, noun ūr, and noun nakar have a long history of literary attestations. (Th verb ūr- (DEDR 749) is also attested in Tamil, Malayalam, and Konda.) The verb nakar- seems be of a much later coinage. 

In other words, not only is nakar- not attested in languages other than Tamil, but even in Tamil, it is very late. So, in my opinion, Ganesan's proposal of *nakar as a Proto-Dravidian word for crocodile is not an acceptable etymology for Sanskrit nakra, etc.

Palaniappan

I told Ganesan that Tamil nakar 'to creep (as a reptile), to crawl (as
an infant), to sneak away' (TL), to which he had drawn my
attention, might be the sole survivor of Proto-Dravidian *nakar
and in that case a better etymology for Sanskrit
nakra etc. and Proto-Dravidian *nekaL than Proto-Dravidian
*neka- (DEDR 3730) that I proposed on p. 19 of my crocodile
paper (2011).

>>
>> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>
>> Etymology for Sanskrit makara
>>
>> Dravidian Etymological Dictionary (Revised edition, abbreviated as

>> (Dravidian Languages, 2003, p. 13).
>>
>> However, on p.7 of his article, Ganesan states, "The  
>> Proto-Dravidian root for makara is *mokaray- a verbal noun from the  
>> verb, *mok-/*moṅku- 'to eat greedily in large mouthfuls, eat

>>
>> DEDR entries 4897 and 5127 are given below.

>>
>> I do not understand how Ganesan could get the Proto-Dravidian  
>> 'root' *moṇku- from these entries.
>>
>> Having postulated *mok-/*moṅku- from DEDR 5127 and 4897, Ganesan states:
>>
>> "The Dravidian verb, mok-/moṅk- transforms to moc-/moñc- in south  
>> Dravidian languages."
>>
>> As far as I know, there has been no basis for such a context-free

>> for 'crocodile' in north Dravidian languages, Kurukh and Malto,  
>> also have -c- and not -k- in DEDR 4952.)
>>
>> Then Ganesan goes on to say:
>>
>> "Hence Kannada and Telugu have mosale or mosali (< *mokaray), and  
>> Tamil and Malayalam derives its mosale> motalai > mutalai from the  
>> same verbal root, mok- with -r- > -l- alternation in the South."
>>
>> Ganesan has not presented any evidence of -oka- transforming to  
>> -oca- or -osa- in south Dravidian languages. So, in my opinion,  
>> Ganesan has not provided an acceptable Dravidian etymology that  
>> supposedly explains Sanskrit 'makara' as well as Tamil mutalai.
>>
>> Etymology for nakra/nākra
>>
>> Ganesan also has given an etymology for Indo-Aryan words for 
>> gharial, the long-snouted crocodile.
>>
>> On p. 4 of his paper, Ganesan says, " The god Śiva in Tamil bhakti  
>> texts of the first millennium, is extolled as either nakkar or  
>> viṭaṅkar indicating Śiva’s nudity and his virile lingam in  
>> particular. These epithets for Śiva and his lingam have origin in

>> streets and attracting women: maṉaikaḷ tōṟum talai kai ēnti  
>> viṭaṅkarākit tirivatu eṉṉē? (Tevaram 7.6.1)."
>>

>> simply not valid according to Tamil philology.  Indeed the text

>> Digital Tēvāram edition (from EFEO, Pondicherry) as "what is the  
>> reason for wandering from house to house, assuming a beauteous form  
>> and asking alms, " where he translates viṭaṅkar as 'beauteous form”  
>> (http://tinyurl.com/p7vg2wl). ; That viṭaṅkar is not naked is shown  
>> by Tēvāram 7.36.3, another verse by Cuntarar, the same person who  
>> authored the verse quoted by Ganesan too. In this verse translated  
>> by V. M. Subramanya Iyer, Viṭaṅkar is explicitly described as  
>> wearing a loin-cloth as given below (http://tinyurl.com/nbns4gt).
>>
>> You are pure in your eyes, mouth and body, you wear a sewn  
>> loin-cloth, give up dancing along with pēy in the cremation-ground,  
>> are you a mad person? Our master! Civaṉ, who is known by the name  
>> of Āraṇiya viṭaṅkar in Paiññīli surrounded by a verdant garden  
>> which has mast wood trees, cool and green delight of the woods, and 
>> lotus flowers growing in the moats into which water flows.
>>
>> So there is no connection between nudity and viṭaṅkar as claimed by Ganesan.
>>
>> On pp. 7-8 of his paper, Ganesan says, "In East India (Nepali,  
>> Bihari, Bengali) (3) nakar is the name of gharial [13], directly  
>> derivable from the Tamil verb, nakar- ‘to creep, to crawl slowly’.  
>> Compared to muggers (< makara), gharials have much smaller, weak  
>> legs and cannot do ‘high walk’ as muggers can (Figures 7, 8). When  
>> gharials come to the shore for sun bathing or for laying eggs, they  
>> creep on the banks awkwardly pushing their huge bodies forward.  
>> From this Dravidian nakar, Sanskrit gets nakra-/nākra- and Middle  
>> Indo-Aryan nakka-. In Tamil Tevaram texts, Śiva is called  
>> nakkar/nakkaṉ due to his nudity traceable to the phallus shape of  
>> the gharial snout and its ancient name."
>>
>> While Ganesan easily moves from Tamil nakar to Dravidian nakar,  
>> DEDR does not include an entry that includes Tamil nakar 'to creep,  
>> to crawl slowly'. There seem to be no cognates of nakar in any  
>> other Dravidian language including Telugu and Kannada. (nakar is  
>> not included in Emeneau and Burrow's  "Dravidian Borrowings from  
>> Indo-Aryan" either.) So Tamil nakar 'to creep slowly, crawl slowly'  
>> being the source of Indo-Aryan nakra/nākra is not very convincing  
>> to me.  As a result, tracing nakkar/nakkaṉ (referring to Śiva) "to  
>> the phallus shape of the gharial snout and its ancient name" also  
>> seems to be impossible.
>>
>> However, there is another possibility, as Burrow and Emeneau seem to think.
>>
>> DEDR 3732 entry is given below.

>> 3732 Ka. negar̤, negar̤e alligator. Tu. negaḷů id.; negarů a

>>
>> Etymology of Tamil        iṭaṅkar
>>
>> As best as I could figure out Ganesan's chain of reasoning, this is  
>> how Ganesan seems to arrive at how Tamil words viṭaṅkar/iṭaṅkar are  
>> interpreted as referring to gharial.
>>
>> Śiva is naked as Bhikṣāṭana.
>>
>> Gharial's snout has the shape of a phallus.
>>
>> Gharial is called nakka in Middle Indo-Aryan
>>
>> So Śiva is called nakkar because he is naked.
>>
>> Tamil viṭaṅku means 'to be erect (as lingam)' (Ganesan's own interpretation)
>>
>> Śiva is called viṭaṅkar.
>>
>> So viṭaṅkar stands for the male organ.
>>
>> Gharial's snout has the shape of a phallus.
>>
>> So viṭaṅkar in Tamil means gharial.
>>
>> According to Ganesan, viṭaṅkar lost the initial v- and became iṭaṅkar.
>>
>> The word viṭaṅkar referring to a crocodile occurs for the first  
>> time in the Varatarāca Aiyaṅkār Pākavatam, a 16th century text.  
>> Earlier literary texts or lexicons do not mention that word. But

>> crocodile that attacked the elephant in the Gajendra Mokṣa episode.  
>> (For example, see Kamparāṃāyaṇam 5.12.79.3.)
>>
>> (In fact, contrary to Ganesan’s suggestion of viṭaṅkar being the

>>
>> Even if one accepts the form viṭaṅkar to be earlier, in the 16th
