O, Pardon me, Dear JLC.

A very happy 2015!

The paper under consideration sounded fascinating to me. I hadn't seen it before. So, I sincerely wanted to understand the etymology of the Sanskrit term "makara" through professional Sanskritists. Sorry for having mentioned your name in my posting. 

OK, my interest has disappeared now!

Sincerely,
--VSR (USA)
