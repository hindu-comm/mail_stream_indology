1. ARE THERE ANY OTHER STRONG (extensive) EXAMPLES?

--- http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/volume-v-17.html :
Three Satires
by Nilakantha, Kshemendra and Bhallata

Bhallata is an addition to the discussion here:

Intro says: Bhállata the disgruntled court poet speaks of a setting sun
(his former king and patron Avánti·varma) being replaced by a flickering
firefly (the new king Shánkara·deva, who did not continue his predecessor’s
patronage).


2. Satire in Indian literature? WHAT is usually criticized?



Even gods are subjects of satire:



Example:

kiM vAsasA ityatra vichAraNIyaM
vAsaH pradhAnaM khalu yogyatAyai |
pItAmbaraM vIkShya dadau svakanyAM
digambaraM vIkShya viShaM samudraH ||

kamale brahmA shete haraH shete himAlaye |
kshIrabdhau cha hariH shete manye matkuNashankaya ||

3. Satire in Indian philosophy? Criticism of WHAT?



There are satires on different schools of Vedic and non-Vedic philosophy on
different schools of Vedanta.



Gajam mithyaa Palaayanam mithyaa is an example. There is a Satire on
Advaita and a counter-satire to it here.
