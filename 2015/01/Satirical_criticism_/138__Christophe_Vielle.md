I would add on the topic:

Donald R. Davis, 'Satire as Apology: The Puruṣārtthakkūttŭ of Kerala', In: Kesavan Veluthat & Id. eds, Irreverent History: Essays for M.G.S. Narayanan, Delhi: Primus Books, pp. 93-109.
Two satirical theatre-genres (rūpaka) :

• the prahasana, of which the Bhagavadajjuka (which brings into ridicule the doctrines of Buddhism) is (like the Mattavilāsa) another good example:
cf. - K.K. Malathi Devi, Prahasanas in Sanskrit Literature and Kerala Stage, Delhi: Nag Publishers, 1995.

- Paulose, K.G., Bhagavadajjukam in Kūṭiyāṭṭam: The Hermit and the Harlot - the Sanskrit farce in Performance, Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corp. 2000. 

Note the transl. of the farce by J.A.B. Van Buitenen in Mahfil (1971): jstor.org/stable/40874441
 • the bhāṇa (satirical monologue)

cf.  for example The Quartet of Causeries, by Śyāmilaka, Vararuci, Śūdraka & Īśvaradatta, translated by Csaba Dezső & Somadeva Vasudeva, Clays Sanskrit Library 2009.

In the philosophical debate, there are a few satirical expressions to find in :

J.-M. Verpoorten, 'Quelques tournures péjoratives dans le débat philosophique en sanskrit', IT 28, 2002, pp. 267-79. http://www.indologica.com/volumes/vol28/vol28_art13_VERPOORTEN.pdf

About the jaina parodical Dhuttakkhāṇa of Haribhadra referred to by A. Ollett, see Haribhadra, Ballade des coquins, présentation et traduction du prakrit par Jean-Pierre Osier et Nalini Balbir, Paris: GF Flammarion, 2004).
