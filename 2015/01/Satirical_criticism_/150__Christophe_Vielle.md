>> Dear List Members, 
>> In order to pay a tribute to freedom of critical expression my Master course "Sanskrit, scientific and philosophical lingua franca" will in the following weeks, as it did yesterday, focus on 
>> 
>> Satirical criticism in Sanskrit literature and philosophy
>> 
>> Without trying to be in any way complete I propose that the work of the following authors can be regarded as, to some extent at least, belonging in this category:
>> Bhartrhari the poet/subhasita collector, Jayarasi, Ksemendra.
>> Part of Bhavabhuuti's Maalatiimaadhava reads as satirical criticism on Kapaalikas. 
>> 
>> Now my question: ARE THERE ANY OTHER STRONG (extensive) EXAMPLES?
>> 
>> Satire in Indian literature? WHAT is usually criticized?
>> 
>> Satire in Indian philosophy? Criticism of WHAT? (Tattvopaplavasimha: of all philosophical-religious "truths" without trying to establish one's own).
>> 
>> Writing satirical criticism in Sanskrit in a manuscript is not the same as expressing such criticism in the most accessible "language" thinkable: comics published in a weekly. 
>> HOW was satirical criticism in ancient, classical India RECEIVED? 
>> Did anyone suffer on account of critical views expressed in Sanskrit? Or only when it was 
>> expressed in a more popular language like Hindi (Kabir)?
