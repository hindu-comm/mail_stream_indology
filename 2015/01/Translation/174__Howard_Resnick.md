Van Buitenen translates the first pada of Maha-bharata CE 3.5.19 as “You have never, Vidura, told me wrong;”

The Sanskrit: sa mA jihmaM vidura sarvaM bravISi

In terms of context (Dhrtarastra is rejecting Vidura’s counsel as false) and grammar, this seems to mean something like: "You, Vidura, speak all deceit/falsehood to me."

Am I missing something?

Thanks for your help!

Howard
