Dear Prof. Witzel,

I really liked the two translations : 1. We wish to put (into us)
(Witzel-Gotō) 2. Might we make our own  (Jamison-Brereton) for dhīmahi .

May I know what is so compelling in the word dhīmahi  that makes you say,

 "dhīmahi is definitely not, as usually translated so far and also just now
on this list, to be taken from dhī "think deeply"; later: "meditate"…"

Thanks

Regards,

Nagaraj
