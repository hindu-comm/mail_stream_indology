Dear friends and colleagues,

in the message I sent yesterday I forgot to stress the fact that the CBCs are open (also) to early career researchers (PhD students, recent PhDs etc.). Thus, please feel free to pass on the relevant information to your students and younger colleagues.

Best,

elisa (freschi)

Dear friends and colleagues,

in case you are considering to visit Rome at the end of this Summer, here is an additional reason for doing it. Please consider the following also as an invitation to join a collaborative enterprise which might be more intriguing and stimulating (and will surely be more fun) than usual conferences:

A Coffee Break Conference on Comparison and Comparative Method
Rome, Institute of Oriental Studies, University "Sapienza", 17--19 September 2015

About the CBCs in general
The Coffee Break Conference (CBC) project is the result of a larger reflection on the common sensical statement that "the most interesting  parts of a conference are the coffee breaks". One yawns or falls asleep while most papers are read — apart from a couple of them and one's own one. By contrast, one often takes part of challenging and fascinating debates while sipping at a cup of tea or coffee. Often, the same papers sound thought-provoking and insightful during the breaks, and extremely boring while they are actually read. Therefore, what a "coffee break conference" aims at is to leave behind the rigidity and formality of the official academic and scholarly meetings and to favour an open-minded exchange of ideas, suggestions, discussions and criticisms, within the spirit of a friendly dialogue held in an informal atmosphere.
