Respected scholars,
Sorry for cross posting.

I am looking for available commentaries on gaNapATha (Paninian or other
grammar systems).

I searched for it and could gather only gaNaratnamahodadhi.

I am sure there must be some other commentaries as well. Any pointers to
that regards would be welcome.
