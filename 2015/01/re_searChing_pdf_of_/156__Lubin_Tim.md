Wu Juan’s copy being clearer and more complete, I have taken the liberty of using it to replace the one I uploaded to Archive.  If you fetched that one, you will want to replace it.  The link remains the same:
https://archive.org/details/Levi.1932.Karmavibhanga
(It is uploading now, 46 MB, and should be ready within a few minutes.)

Dear colleagues,

I have so far sought in vain for a scan of this work online. Can anyone oblige?

Thank you and best wishes,
