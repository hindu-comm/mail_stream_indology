The Maharashtra Rajya Sahitya & Samskriti Mandal has now made 444 of its
Marathi book publications available for free download:

For those who read Marathi, this is a treasure of rare and out-of-print
books.  In the past, I had to struggle to find many of these books in
bookstores in Pune.  Now they are a click away.  Hope you find something of
value in this collection.
