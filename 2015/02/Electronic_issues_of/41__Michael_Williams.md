Dear colleagues,

I am trying to find electronic editions of "The Pandit" which contain
Raghunatha Siromani's Padarthatattvanirupana along with the commentaries
of Ramabhadra and Raghudeva. I have some of the issues from DLI, but as
far as I can see the following are not available there:

No. 26 (1904)
28 (1906)
34 (1912)
35 (1913)
36 (1914)

If anyone knows of any digitised editions, I would be very grateful if you
could contact me off-list.

Best regards,

Michael Williams,
University of Vienna
