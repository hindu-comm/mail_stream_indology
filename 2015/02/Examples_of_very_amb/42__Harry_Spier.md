Dear list members,

I need to show to some non-sanskritists that given a Sanskrit phrase in
devanagari, that how you put in the word breaks in the transliteration can
result in phrases with very different meanings.

Can any of the list members give examples of short sentences in simple
sanskrit in devanagari that when the words are split  differently in the
transliteration give grammatically correct Sanskrit sentences but produce
Sanskrit phrases with  "radically" different meanings.

For my purposes simple Sanskrit sentences are better than more complicated
Sanskrit from the literature.  And sentences that give very different
meanings depending on how the words are broken up are better than more
subtle differences.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
