>From a legal standpoint here is an interesting example given by Mādhava in his Pārāśara-Mādhavīya about a plea in a court of law that is "ambiguous" saṃdighdha. Here the operative words are: "mayādeyam" -- which could be mayā + adeyam OR mayā deyam, with totally opposite meanings. Here is the quote:

PārM III: 75‒76: देयं मयेत्युक्ते सति संदेहमन्तरेण दातव्यनिश्चयो भवति तदनुक्त्वा मयादेयमिति यद्ब्रूयात्तदानीम् अदेयमिति वा देयमिति वा पदस्य छेत्तुं शक्यत्वादुत्तरं संदिग्धं भवति ।
