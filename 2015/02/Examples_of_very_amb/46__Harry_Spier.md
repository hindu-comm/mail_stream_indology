Thanks for these replies.

What will help me the most is some very simple Sanskrit phrases that
show  completely different meanings by how you put breaks in the
transliteration.  I need to show examples of this to non-sanskritist,
non-devanagari knowing typesetters.

The best I could come up with is:

पुष्पमध्येति स्मरति च

which can be:

puṣpam adhyeti smarati ca He turns his mind towards the lotus and remembers
it.

or
puṣpa-madhyeti smarati ca = puṣpa-madhya iti smarati ca = He  remembers  [the
phrase] "the middle of the lotus"

More examples like this would be useful.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
