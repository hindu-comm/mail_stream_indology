In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3 there is a sentence that, if memory 
serves, can be read as either sam enena vadiṣya iti '[He thought], "I 
will speak with him"' or sa mene na vadiṣya iti 'He thought, "I will not 
say [all that I know]"'. Again if memory serves, Patrick Olivelle and 
Śaṅkara -- two great authorities in their different ways -- both uphold 
the latter meaning, but I admit the former has always made more sense to 
me (not least because the two people concerned do end up conversing in 
the very next sentence, using the verb sam+vad).
