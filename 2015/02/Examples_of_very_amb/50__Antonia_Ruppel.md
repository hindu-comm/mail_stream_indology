Dear Harry,

There is also something in one of the stories from the Kathāsaritsāgara
quoted by Lanman in his reader: Section 26 (pp. 49-53) = vi.108-164, which
Lanman calls 'The king who didn't know his Sanskrit grammar'. The crucial
scene is one where the king misinterprets

modakair (= mā udakaih) deva paritāḍaya mām '*don't* pelt me *with
water*/throw water at me'

as

modakair etc 'pelt me *with sweets*'.

(His ignorance thus revealed, he then needs to go ahead and study Sanskrit
properly.)

Maybe this helps?

All best,
     Antonia
