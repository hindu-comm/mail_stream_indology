Different interpretations of the Bhagavadgita verses by different
commentators often are a result of different ways of splitting the words.
A good example is: nāsato vidyate bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ.  This is
interpreted by Śaṅkara to mean that there is no bhāva for asat, and there
is no abhāva for sat.  Other commentators have read the line differently by
punctuating it in a different way: nāsato vidyate 'bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate
sataḥ : There is no abhāva for either sat or asat.  The phrase
traiguṇyaviṣayā vedaḥ nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna has similar different
readings.  One reading says that the Vedas have the three guṇas as their
domain (viṣaya), but, O Arjuna, free yourself from these three guṇas.  If I
remember correctly, Madhva says traiguṇya-viṣa-yā vedāḥ : traiguṇyam eva
viṣam, tad yāpayanti apagamayanti.
