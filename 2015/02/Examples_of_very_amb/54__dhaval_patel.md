I am currently working with a manuscript of 'virahiNIpralApaH' which is a
kAvya where the stanzas by rule have such quality.

I hope the following stanza may be useful for your purpose.

न हन्ति गमनं कस्य *मधुरध्वनि रागतः* ।

यच्चूतं मधुपव्रातो *मधुरध्वनिरागतः* ॥ ४ ॥

प.वि. -

न हन्ति गमनं कस्य मधुः अध्वनि रागतः । यत् चूतं मधुप-व्रातः मधुर-ध्वनिः आगतः
॥

अन्वयः -

मधुः कस्य अध्वनि रागतः गमनं न हन्ति यत्‌ मधुरध्वनिः मधुपव्रातः चूतं आगतः ।

व्याख्या -

कस्य नरस्य । मधुः वसन्तः । अध्वनि पथि । रागतः रागवशात्‌ । मधुपव्रातो
भ्रमरश्रेणिः । किंविशिष्टो मधुपव्रातः मधुरध्वनिः ।
