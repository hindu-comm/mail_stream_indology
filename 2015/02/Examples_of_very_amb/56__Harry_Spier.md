Dipak Bhattacharya raises a point I've wondered about.
1) Why wasn't (until recently) avagraha used to resolve this kind of
ambiguity.
2)  Is avagraha only a written sign or is it some kind of pause in spoken
Sanskrit
3) How far back does avagraha go.  To Panini, pre-Panini, post-Panini ?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
