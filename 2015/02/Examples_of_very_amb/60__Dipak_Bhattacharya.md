Dear Mr. Spier and other colleagues,
I spoke of the double avagraha as not noted by me in mss. The single one is
common there.
The avagraha was known to the padapaathakaara,Paa.nini and the
Rk-Praati;saakhya. These were orally composed; hence the avagraha was a
linguistic element that was uttered, at least orally indicated, but not a
mere written sign like the apostrophe in the Roman scripts. As as I
remember Renou remarked on its pronunciation. That might have been a
negative feature like a pause but an oral feature and by no means a written
sign alone. I must find out somehow Renou's remark.
Those who are aware of Renou's remark may kindly comment.
Best
