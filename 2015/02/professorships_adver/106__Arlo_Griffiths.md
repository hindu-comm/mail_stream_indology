Dear colleagues,

The attached announcement of vacancies at Religious Studies section of the École pratique des hautes études (Paris), among which a direction d'étude (professorship) of Indian Buddhism, was just brought to my attention. This position is for the succession of Prof. Dr. Cristina Scherrer-Schaub, who will retire at the end of this academic year.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
