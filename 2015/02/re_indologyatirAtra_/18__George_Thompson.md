Dear Michael and TP,

Thank you for this news.  May I mention it in our forthcoming volume in
honor of Frits?  I am in the midst of writing an introduction to it.  I
would like to spread the word.

Best wishes to you both.  We all look forward to your reports on recent
Vedic ritual activity.

George
