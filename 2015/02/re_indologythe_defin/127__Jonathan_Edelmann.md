Dear Prof Kellner,

There is a good discussion of vārttika (along with other terms like bhāṣya,
nibandha, ṭīkā, ṭippaṇa, etc.) in Ch 8 ("Commentary and Creativity")
ofJonardon Ganeri's _The Lost Age of Reason: Philosophy in Early Modern
India 1450-1700_. A number of Buddhist, Nyāya, etc. authors and texts are
discussed on the very topic in question.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Edelmann
