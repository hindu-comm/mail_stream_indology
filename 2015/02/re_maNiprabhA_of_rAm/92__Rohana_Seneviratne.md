Subject: [INDOLOGY] maṇiprabhā of rāmānandasarasvatī

I’m hoping that a list member can share a Sanskrit text of maṇiprabhā of rāmānandasarasvatī, a commentary on the yogasūtra. The DLI copy, which repeatedly failed to download with DLI Downloader turns out to be a defective scan. I tried to download it page by page and found that none of the scanned pages is complete.
