Not sure if it would help … There is a text in Tamil named “yāpparuṅkalakkārikai,” which defines the rules for composing Tamil poetry.

 This text is attributed to amitacākarar, a Jain, of the ~11th century. 

Each verse in this text is addressed to a woman (“kārikai”). 

If anyone would be interested to know further about this text, let me know.

Regards,
Rajam
