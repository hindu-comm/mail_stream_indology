Dear all,

In preparing the editio princeps of the so called Wright Chronicle, a Chronicle in Nepali translated by Daniel Wright in 1877, we (Manik Bajracharya and me) came across two apparently Śaiva phrases which do not make much sense to us:

This ascetic built another house near the place, invoked Svatantra-mūlamūrti-ūrddhāmnāya and continued to perform the daily worship of Paśupatinātha

The ascetic, too, caused the tāṃḍamantra together with Mahākālokta-agamārtha-nṛtyalīlā-prasannārtha to be inscribed on the parasol, and this unprecedented parasol was then offered to Paśupatinātha.

Can anybody help us in understanding it (better)?

Best,
Axel Michaels
