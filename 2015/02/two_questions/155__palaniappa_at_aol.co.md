At least for the second item, I may have a possible suggestion. It is possible you may have a dance style being referred to by the term agamÄrtha which seems to have undergone some changes going from Tamil into Sanskrit either due to different forms of hypercorrection or possible transcription errors.  The source word in the Tamil tradition is akamÄrkkam (transliterated in Tamil Lexicon style) which is a hybrid made up of Tamil akam and Sanskrit mÄrga. If one were to transliterate it based on pronunciation, it could be transliterated as ahamÄrga or agamÄrga. (The classical Tamil text, the AkanÄá¹Å«á¹u (transliterated in Tamil Lexicon style) is variously transliterated as the AhanÄá¹Å«á¹u and the AganÄá¹Å«á¹u.) The BharatÄrá¹ava of NandikeÅvara transliterates this as ahamÄrga. (See pp. 34 and 137) in the attachment. In the same attachment, MahÄkÄla is said to be invoked at the entrance to the stage during the first performance or installation of the stage (pp. 472-474). 


South Indian Inscriptions vol. 23, inscription no. 306 transliterates it as agamÄrgga.


Was the ascetic from the Tamil country? What is the date of the text?

Palaniappan

Dear all,  




In preparing the editio princeps of the so called Wright Chronicle, a Chronicle in Nepali translated by Daniel Wright in 1877, we (Manik Bajracharya and me) came across two apparently Åaiva phrases which do not make much sense to us:  




   This ascetic built another house near the place, invoked Svatantra-mÅ«lamÅ«rti-Å«rddhÄmnÄya and continued to perform the daily worship   of PaÅupatinÄtha   





 The ascetic, too, caused the tÄá¹á¸amantra together with MahÄkÄlokta-agamÄrtha-ná¹tyalÄ«lÄ-prasannÄrtha to be inscribed on the parasol, and this unprecedented parasol was then offered to PaÅupatinÄtha. 






Can anybody help us in understanding it (better)?  





Best, 

Axel Michaels
