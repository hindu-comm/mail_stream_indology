I am sorry my email client somehowmessed up the diacritics. Let me try again with some additional informationtoo.

At least for the second item, Imay have a possible suggestion. It is possible you may have a dance style beingreferred to by the term agamÄrtha which seems to have undergone somechanges going from Tamil into Sanskrit either due to different forms ofhypercorrection or possible transcription errors.  The source word in theTamil tradition is akamÄÂrkkam(transliterated in Tamil Lexicon style) which is a hybrid made up of Tamil akamand Sanskrit mÄÂrga. If one were totransliterate akamÄÂrkkam based onpronunciation, it could be transliterated as ahamÄrga or agamÄÂrga. (The classical Tamil text, the AkanÄÂá¹Å«á¹u (transliterated in Tamil Lexicon style) is variouslytransliterated as the AhanÄÂá¹Å«á¹u  andthe AganÄÂá¹Å«á¹u .) TheBharatÄÂrá¹ava of NandikeÅvara transliterates this as ahamÄÂrga. (See pp. 34 and 137) in the attachment. In the same attachment, MahÄÂkÄÂla is said to beinvoked at the entrance to the stage during the first performance orinstallation of the stage (pp. 472-474). 

South Indian Inscriptions vol. 23,inscription no. 306 of 1190-91 CE transliterates the term as agamÄÂrgga in the summary although the inscription has thevariants in Tamil as akamÄá¹kam and [akamÄá¹]kkam.

Aá¹­iyÄrkkunallÄr,the commentator of the CilappatikÄram refers to akamÄrkkam in hiscommentary on CilappatikÄram 3.12.

Was the ascetic from the Tamilcountry? What is the date of the text?

Regards,
Palaniappan

Dear all,  




In preparing the editio princeps of the so called Wright Chronicle, a Chronicle in Nepali translated by Daniel Wright in 1877, we (Manik Bajracharya and me) came across two apparently Åaiva phrases which do not make much sense to us:  




   This ascetic built another house near the place, invoked Svatantra-mÅ«lamÅ«rti-Å«rddhÄmnÄya and continued to perform the daily worship   of PaÅupatinÄtha   





 The ascetic, too, caused the tÄá¹á¸amantra together with MahÄkÄlokta-agamÄrtha-ná¹tyalÄ«lÄ-prasannÄrtha to be inscribed on the parasol, and this unprecedented parasol was then offered to PaÅupatinÄtha. 






Can anybody help us in understanding it (better)?  





Best, 

Axel Michaels
