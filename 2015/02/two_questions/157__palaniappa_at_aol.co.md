I am sorry it looks like the fonts did not come through right the second time too. So I am attaching the post as a PDF.


Please discard the two earlier posts.



Regards,
Palaniappan

Dear all,  




In preparing the editio princeps of the so called Wright Chronicle, a Chronicle in Nepali translated by Daniel Wright in 1877, we (Manik Bajracharya and me) came across two apparently Śaiva phrases which do not make much sense to us:  




   This ascetic built another house near the place, invoked Svatantra-mūlamūrti-ūrddhāmnāya and continued to perform the daily worship   of Paśupatinātha   





 The ascetic, too, caused the tāṃḍamantra together with Mahākālokta-agamārtha-nṛtyalīlā-prasannārtha to be inscribed on the parasol, and this unprecedented parasol was then offered to Paśupatinātha. 






Can anybody help us in understanding it (better)?  





Best, 

Axel Michaels
