Cullavagga IV 2.5: *Seyyathāpi bhikkhave caṇḍassa kukkurassa nāsāya pittaṃ
bhindeyyuṃ. Evaṃ hi so bhikkhave kukkuro bhiyyosomattāya caṇḍataro assa.*

Oldenberg's translation: "Just, O Bhikkhus, as if you were to burst a gall
(bladder) before the nose of a fierce dog, the dog would thereby become so
much the fiercer [...]

I am at a loss to understand how this image may relate to Devadatta's
negative characteristics - as described in this part of the text.

The PTS Pali-English Dictionary notes under *pitta*: 'The passage is not
clear. [...] May the meaning be "muzzle"?'

Was the fragment commented upon in the Cullavagga-atthakatha?
Unfortunately, I do not have access to it. A quotation from the Atthakatha
and comments would be more than welcome.

Thanking you in advance,

Artur Karp
