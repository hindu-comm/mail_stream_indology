A colleague in agriculture has asked the following questions:

Is there anything in Ayurvedic medicine texts on the value of plant nectar
as a medicinal material ?

Is there anything in Ayurvedic texts on plants versus liver flukes of
cattle or bilharzia, the human equivalent, which the ancient Egyptians
suffered from?

Do any of the Ayurveda Pandits on the list have suggestions/information on
these?

Cheers
