Harry Falk has written to me as follows:

There is something in my book Schrift im alten Indien, Tübingen 1993, pp.
117-119.

His conclusion: "Eine Verbindung der bislang einzigartigen Zeichen mit der
Brāhmī ist reine Spekulation. Die angebotenen Lesungen entbehren jeder
Grundlage."

So, not unexpectedly, that's it, then. Verdict: unknown but almost
certainly not Brāhmī.
