Belated thanks to all who offered suggestions, on and off the list, in 
response to my query. I'll certainly consider including an excerpt from 
Halbfass, but for my present purposes I believe Paul Oliver's Hinduism 
and the 1960s: The Rise of a Counter-culture may prove to be the book 
I've been looking for. Thanks again!

Martin Gansten
