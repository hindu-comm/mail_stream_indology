Dear Colleagues,

I am writing on behalf of a graduate student of mine who is working on  
Indo-Persian texts and wishes to examine the Persian translations of  
the Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. Unfortunately these are not available in our  
library and I wonder if someone would be kind to share a scan of these  
texts, either of the manuscripts or of contemporary editions.
Many thanks,
Roy
