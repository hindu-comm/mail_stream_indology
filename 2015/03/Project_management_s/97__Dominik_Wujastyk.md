Dear colleagues, is anyone using open-source project management software to
manage a group of people working together?  I'm thinking of suites like
Redmine, ToDoYu, qdPM, Admidio and so on.  Most of these products come out
of the software development community, but as an increasing number of us
work in the context of funded projects with multiple participants -
sometimes in different locations - I think one or other of these tools
could be helpful even to indologists.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
