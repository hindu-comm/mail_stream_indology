Dear colleagues,

Please find the announcement and call for applications for the Second International Intensive Course in Old Javanese, which will take place in August this year, at the following page: <http://www.efeo.fr/base.php?code=806>.

I'd be grateful if some of you who follow other relevant lists would transmit the information.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
