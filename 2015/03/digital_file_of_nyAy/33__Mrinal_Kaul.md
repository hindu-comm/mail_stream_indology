Dear All,

I would highly appreciate if someone can share with me a handy digital
edition of the Nyāyasūtravārtika of Uddyotakara? Since I am travelling I
don't have access to my hard drives and the Thakur's edition available on
DLI seems difficult to download at the moment.

Thanks very much in advance.

Yours,

Mrinal Kaul
