In the 1945 Nirṇayasāgara Press edition of the Suśrutasaṃhita,
<https://archive.org/details/sushrutasamhita> the page before the upodghāta
states that the editor Nārāyaṇa Rāma had sight of an old palm-leaf MS of
the SS that was in the collection of Y. T. Ācārya.

Does anyone know anything about YTA's manuscript collection?  Was it merged
into one of the Bombay collections?  Are members of his family still alive?

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
