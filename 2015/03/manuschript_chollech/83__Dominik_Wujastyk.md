Dea
r Karin,

In the 1945 Nirṇayasāgara Press edition of the Suśrutasaṃhita,
<https://archive.org/details/sushrutasamhita> the page before the upodghāta
states that the editor Nārāyaṇa Rāma had sight of an old palm-leaf MS of
the SS that was in the collection of Y. T
rikamji
Ācārya.

Do
 you know anything about YTA's manuscript collection?  Was it merged into
one of the Bombay collections?  Are members of his family still alive?

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
