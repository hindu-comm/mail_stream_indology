Dear indologists,
	We noticed a quirk in the display of puur.n virAma (i.e. in the Sanskrit Library phonetic ascii encoding pUrR = KH pUrN) in Devanagari and wonder whether anyone has seen this display properly in a webpage with the proper characters.  Here is the Devanagari qwerty input:

पूर्ण	This is p U r f N
पूर्ण्	This is p U r f N f

As you can see they are identical.

पूर्ण्‌्	This is p U r f N f f f
Finally the virAma displays, but it should not require three virama characters to do so.
Thanks for your help.
Yours,
Peter
