Dear Dr. Bhattacharya,


Thank you for your message. Based on online and offline replies, it is obvious that no Indology member subscribes to the view  that Patañjali and Bharata were Tamils. As for Patañjali, all the scholars seem to locate him in north India but there are differences between scholars on the exact location in north India. I do not know what the basis of Nachimuthu's view was.


Regards,
Palaniappan

Patañjali states on V. 3 Paspaśāhnika, priyataddhitā dākṣiṇātyāḥ while commenting on the use of the word luikika instead of loke by Kātyāyana. It seems to indicate that Patañjali distinguished himself from the Dākṣiṇātyas ‘Southerners’.

Best wishes for all

Subject: The authors of the Nāṭyaśāstra and the Mahābhāṣya    

Prof. K. Nachimuthu was the former      Chairperson of Center of Indian Languages (CIL) at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi and is the current      Head of the Department of Tamil at the Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN) in Tiruvārūr, the Indian partner institution in the European Research Council-sponsored project entitled      "     Going from Hand to Hand: Networks of Intellectual Exchange in the Tamil Learned Traditions" (http://www.manuscript-cultures.uni-hamburg.de/netamil/images/network.png).          



      Prof. Nachimuthu claims in a Tamil blog (       http://nirappirikai.blogspot.com/2010/11/blog-post_8125.html ) that the author(s) of the Nāṭyaśāstra, and Patañjali, the author of the Mahābhāṣya were Tamils.  I would like to know if this view is shared by other Indologists.     




      Thanks in advance      




      Regards,     

      Palaniappan
