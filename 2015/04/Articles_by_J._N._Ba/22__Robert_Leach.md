Dear colleagues,

I'm looking to get hold of two articles by J.N. Banerjea, both published in
the *Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art* (JISOA), namely:

'The Holy Pañcavīras of the Vṛṣṇis', in JISOA 10 (1942): 65-68.

and

'Images of Sāmba', in JISOA 11 (1944): 129-134.

If any members of the list should have electronic copies of either of these
and are willing to share them, I'd be very grateful indeed.

Many thanks in advance,
Robert
