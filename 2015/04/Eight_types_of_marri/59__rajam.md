Dear Manu Francis, George Thompson, Nagaraj Paturi, and others interested in this topic … 

To give you a spec of the Tamil perspective … 

In the Old Tamil anthology called the Akananuru (akanāṉūṟu; அகநானூறு) there’s some reference to what the bride was “told” during the wedding. 

Loosely translated: 

“Without erring from being ‘chaste,’ assist him and be a loving partner to him who has taken you (as his bride)” (Akananuru 86:13-14)

Here, I’ve translated the word “kaRpu” as “chaste” for easy reference. 

++++++++++++

Is there something similar found in non-Tamil texts?

Thanks and regards,
Rajam
