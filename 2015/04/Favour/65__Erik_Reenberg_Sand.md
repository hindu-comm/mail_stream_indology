Dear Dominic,
I bow at your feet. I just checked with a MS in my possession and found the text there. It only shows how important it is for us to consult the MS-tradition! Thanks!
Best
Erik

​Almost all MSS of the Bhagavadgītā have this Mālā text at the beginning, whether or not it is mentioned in catalogue entries.  Rather few BG MSS actually begin "dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre ..." in my experience.
Best,
Dominik
