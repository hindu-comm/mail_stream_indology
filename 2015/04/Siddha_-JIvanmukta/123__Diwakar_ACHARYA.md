Patrick's questions: “Are the terms siddha and jīvanmukta synonymous? If someone is considered to be a siddha, does that imply that they are 'liberated in this lifetime'?”

The classical authors, starting from Śaṅkara and Maṇḍana, raise the same issue but conclude differently. 
They, however, ask your questions in this way: ‘Is a jīvanmukta already a siddha, a man who has already attained liberation, the goal of his life, for whom avidyā has entirely disappeared (vigalitanikhilāvidyaḥ siddhaḥ)?’ ‘If someone is considered to be a jīvanmukta, does this imply that he is a siddha (in the sense I interpreted in the first question), or that jīvanmukta/siddha is just a figurative expression and a person praised so is still a sādhaka but has reached a highly advanced stage in spiritual cultivation and waits only for the final realization?’

Some of the passages (not all) from Śaṅkara, Maṇḍana, and also Vācaspati, relevant to this issue can be found discussed in the paper attached (pp.424-426).

>> With regard to "siddha", there is interesting evidence from a tradition far different from the "religious", and that is Kauṭilya's Arthaśāstra. There the term is used frequently with regard to monetary matters and bookkeeping, but within a religious context we have both siddha used alone and in the compound siddhatāpasa. In these usages, the reference is to a religious virtuoso who is capable of, or believed capable of, doing extraordinary things. See, for example, Arthaśāstra: 1.11.16; 1.12.22; 1.21.24; 4.3.13, 25, 44; 4.4.3; 5.1.3; 5.2.39, 41.
