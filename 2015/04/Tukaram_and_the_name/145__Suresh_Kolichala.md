Nagaraj: I believe the derivation of Telugu *cukka *< Skt. *śukra *is a
folk etymology, although, it is very popular among the Sanskrit pundits of
the Telugu land. The word *cukka *in the meaning of "a small drop", "dot"
and  "star" is found across several Dravidian languages  that it is
difficult to assume that *śukra *became *cukka *and then spread into so
many of these languages (See [DEDR 2646
<http://kolichala.com/DEDR/searchindexid.php?q=2646&esb=1> ]*)*.

Furthermore, beside *vālucukka (**వాలుచుక్క) *for *Śukra*, Telugu has names
for other stars containing *cukka*, such as *vēgucukka *(వేగుచుక్క North
Star),  *ecakankaṭicukka  *(ఏచకంకటిచుక్క uttarāṣaḍa), *kukkacukka *
(కుక్కచుక్క=*punarvasu*), kummarasārecukka (కుమ్మరసారెచుక్క viśākhā), it
becomes clear the the word *cukka *was generic term for star, and not
derived from  Sanskrit *śukra*.
