Dear colleagues,

I am trying to imagine what archery would have been like in ancient India (roughly 2500-2000 years ago). I am interested in archery techniques as well as archery materials (what would the bows and arrows have been made of?). Can anyone recommend some materials on this subject? I have been looking around, but have not yet found quite what I am looking for. It is for purposes of imagining the art more than anything else.

Many thanks,
