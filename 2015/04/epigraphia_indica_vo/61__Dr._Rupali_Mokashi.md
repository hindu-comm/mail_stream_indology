​Is epigraphia indica vol- 40 available as pdf? I am also searching for
Srinivasan, P.R., "Bhoja Suketuvarman's inscription of Saka 328 in the
Prince of Wales Museum", in Journal of Indian History, vol. 57, no. 1​.This
inscription is also known as Wada Inscription of Suketuvaran. It was also
published by K V Ramesh. However I don't have necessary details.  If any
group member has the same please share.
regards
Rupali Mokashi
