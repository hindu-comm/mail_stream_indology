Hello Harry,

     Here is the bibliographic reference to one of my old articles:

1993. "Inscriptional Evidence for Honorific Śrī in Indo-Aryan."  In
*Perspectives
in Indian Aesthetics and Literature, Essays in Honour of the Late Prof. Dr.
G. K. Bhat, *edited by Saroj Deshpande and Maneesha Dikshit.  Pp. 254-278.
Pune, India: Dastane Ramchandra & Co.

    I don't have a ready pdf of this publication, but if you don't have
access to this  book, I can hunt for my copy of it.
