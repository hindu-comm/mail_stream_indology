Dear Friends,

I am seeking clarification on the following terms.

Are the terms s*iddha *and *jÄ«vanmukta* synonymous?

If someone is considered to be a siddha, does that imply that they are
'liberated in this lifetime'?

Does anyone know of any discussion that explicitly links these terms?


All the best,

Patrick McCartney
