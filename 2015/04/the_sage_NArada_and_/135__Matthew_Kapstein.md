One of the many legends of NArada one hears tells of his dreaming that he is among men and women
suffering from various crippling maladies. When he asks why they are in this terrible state, they reply
that they are the rAgas and rAginIs and that they have been broken by his inept performances. On awakening
he performs penance and vows henceforth to achieve music perfection.

Do any of the listmembers know of a traditional literary version of this tale? (It is found in some modern
works on Indian music--these do not interest me unless they reference their sources.)

with thanks in advance,
Matthew
