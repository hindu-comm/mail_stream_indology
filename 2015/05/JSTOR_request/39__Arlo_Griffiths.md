Subject: [INDOLOGY] JSTOR request




Dear colleagues,

Is anyone able to obtain this ABORI paper in pdf from JSTOR: <http://www.jstor.org/stable/41694027>? For reasons that are unclear to me, I am unable to do so myself here from the campus where I am working in Lyon.

Thanks and best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
