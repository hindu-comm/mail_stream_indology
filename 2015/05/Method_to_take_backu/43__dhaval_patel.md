Respected scholars,
Nowadays many NLP scholars are working on Github.
Most of the discussion are stored in github issues.
I have written a small CLI utility in shell script which may be of interest
to the scholars.
It takes a backup of github issues and renders an HTML for local viewing
with the same experience as github (because I used the same CSS:))
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/github_issue_backup is the code
http://drdhaval2785.github.io/github_issue_backup/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/2.txt
is the text output
http://drdhaval2785.github.io/github_issue_backup/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/html/2.html
is the HTML output.

Any bug reporting is welcome at
https://github.com/drdhaval2785/github_issue_backup/issues
