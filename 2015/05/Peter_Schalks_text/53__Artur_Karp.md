Dear All,

I'd like to quote from Peter Schalk's highly interesting paper - *Eḷāra and
Duṭṭhagāmaṇī– Again*.

The pdf of the paper is freely available on the Net, however,
unfortunately, without any biblio data.

May I count on your help in locating the source of the paper?

Best,

Artur Karp
Senior Lecturer in Sanskrit and Pali (ret.)
