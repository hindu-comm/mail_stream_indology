Dear Colleagues,

It seems that our otherwise excellent libraries do not have a copy of 
the following book:


Bhairavānandanāṭakam.
Main Author: 	Maṇika, 14th cent.
Other Authors: 	Dwivedi, Shriman Narain, 1935-
Language(s): 	Sanskrit
Published: 	[n.p.] 1971?]
Note: 	Romanized.
Physical Description: 	11, 49 p. 23 cm.

I know the book has been digitized in the Hathi Trust Digital Library 
and I was wondering if any of you has a digital copy of it.

Best wishes,

Camillo A. Formigatti
