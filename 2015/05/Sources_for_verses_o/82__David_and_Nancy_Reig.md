I, too, am interested in this verse on karma, and in the very old source
reference for it kindly provided by Walter. For those who do not have the
1925-1930 Benares edition of the Prasastapadabhashyam that includes the
Vyomavati commentary, this verse is found on p. 3 of vol. 1 of the improved
edition of the Vyomavatī edited by Gaurinath Sastri (Varanasi: Sampurnanand
Sanskrit Vishvavidyalaya, 1983). Gaurinath Sastri there adds in parentheses
references to Devī-bhāgavata 9.29.69-70 and 40.73.

Best regards,
