Dear Martin,

if I am not wrong, the first stanza is Kumārila’s Ślokavārttika 1.17 (with a 
variant reading jñātārthaṃ i.o. siddhārthaṃ). Some time ago I came across 
a much earlier quotation of the same stanza in the opening part of 
Ratnamati's Cāndravyākaraṇapañjikā (920s–930s). The second stanza is 
Ślokavārttika 1.12. I haven't located it (yet) in the extant parts of Ratna's 
works, but it seems to me highly probable that this Sinhalese scholar has 
quoted it too somewhere. Later scholars in Laṅkā such as Moggallāna and Śrī 
Rāhula borrowed and/or translated into Pali some few stanzas from the 
Ślokavārttika by using Ratna's grammatical works and without knowing that 
they are dealing with stanzas written by Kumārila.

Kind regards,
D.D.
