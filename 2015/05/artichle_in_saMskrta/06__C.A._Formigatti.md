Dear Colleagues,

Can anybody help me by providing a scan of the following short article? 
I was not able to find it online and our library does not have the 
journal.

Acharya, Baburam and Naya Raj Pant
1953 'Mallasamayābhilekhaḥ (vi. saṃ. 1444),' [A Malla-period
inscription (1387)). Saṃskrta-sandeśa 1:8 (V.S. 2010
Marga): 46-48.

Thank you in advance!

Camillo A. Formigatti
