Thank you to everyone who responded so quickly. This list really is wonderful - a wish-fulfilling jewel!
And for those looking for jpts articles, I have learned that they are now all available online!

Best wishes,
Vanessa

Hello colleagues,

I am looking for a clean, well-scanned copy of Steven Collins’ article, “On the Very Idea of the Pali Canon,” Journal of the Pali Text Society 15 (1990).

I have a copy, but the quality is not good and I want to use it for a coursepack. Does anyone have one to send my way? The library does not seem to have this journal in its repertoire for some reason.

Many thanks,
Vanessa R. Sasson
