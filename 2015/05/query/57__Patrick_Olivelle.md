I am looking for the correct version on this blessing someone, non-Sanskrist, mentioned. I know it is faulty but it is a blessing given by Kashmiris:

> यावदिन्द्रो दिव्यो देवो यावच् चन्द्र: प्रभाकर: ।
> यावद् राम: कथालोके भूयात् तावत् ???


The last word he gave me is something like sthistva (??) and that cannot be right.

Thanks.

Patrick
