Two highly probable emendations for the defective verse have already been suggested. Suggesting a third one, दिवो for दिव्यो, I would like to translate the verse as follows: “As long as Indra is the lord of heaven, as long as the Moon casts light (and) as long as the story of Rāma exists in the world, may you remain in existence (or stay in power)!  यावदिन्द्रो दिवो देवो यावच्चन्द्र: प्रभाकर: । यावद्रामकथा लोके भूयात् तावत् स्थितिस्तव ।।

अ.अ.
