Dear Ashok,

I can agree with (a), which is why I didn't make my suggestion 
immediately, but regarding (b) I'm afraid I see plenty of worse 
transcription/transmission errors (we have to make allowance for oral 
transmission as well) than रौ -> र: . As for (c), I see no difference 
between the implicit 'exists' in the third pāda and the implicit 'exist' 
in the second, should we accept my suggested alternative. Also, like 
Walter, I have seen several similar expressions in other places. But I 
certainly don't insist on it; it just strikes me as plausible.

Best wishes,
Martin

(c) The other two syntactically similar clauses of the verse have an action or a state associated with a person or personified entity — Indra rules in svarga and Rāma’s story exists in the world. If an action (‘being a maker of prabhā, spreading light’) is not associated with Candra, which would be the case if prabhākara is taken in the sense of ’the Sun,’ the second quarter would be out of step with the other two. It is very unusual for a Skt composer not to have a sense of symmetry.

For completeness, then, let me add that while यावच्चन्द्रः प्रभाकरः is certainly possible both metrically and with regard to meaning, यावच्चन्द्रप्रभाकरौ strikes me as a very plausible alternative.
