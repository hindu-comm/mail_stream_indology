In favour of Martin’s suggestion, surely prabhākara is far more common as a name for the sun than as an ordinary adjective?

Just a small correction — coming from the wrong numbering of Viśvarūpa’s edition by Ganapati Sastri — the verse number is actually 315. The typesetters omitted the number 309 and numbered verse 309 as 310. So in the entire edition of the first chapter, from 309 onward one has to subtract one from the numbers given in the edition!!

For completeness, then, let me add that while यावच्चन्द्रः प्रभाकरः is certainly possible both metrically and with regard to meaning, यावच्चन्द्रप्रभाकरौ strikes me as a very plausible alternative.

Suggesting a third one, दिवो for दिव्यो, I would like to translate the verse as follows: “As long as Indra is the lord of heaven, as long as the Moon casts light (and) as long as the story of Rāma exists in the world, may you remain in existence (or stay in power)!  यावदिन्द्रो दिवो देवो यावच्चन्द्र: प्रभाकर: । यावद्रामकथा लोके भूयात् तावत् स्थितिस्तव ।।
