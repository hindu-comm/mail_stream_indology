Dear Patrick, Ashok, and colleagues:

perhaps “divi” instead of “divo” is likely?

Also, it might be worth pointing out the possible influence of two parallel “yāvad rāmakathā” verses in the epics, in both instances used to justify Hanuman’s long life (to go on as long as the Rāmakathā is told/heard in the world): Mbh 3.147.37 and Rām 7.39.16.

All best wishes,
Adheesh

Suggesting a third one, दिवो for दिव्यो, I would like to translate the verse as follows: “As long as Indra is the lord of heaven, as long as the Moon casts light (and) as long as the story of Rāma exists in the world, may you remain in existence (or stay in power)!  यावदिन्द्रो दिवो देवो यावच्चन्द्र: प्रभाकर: । यावद्रामकथा लोके भूयात् तावत् स्थितिस्तव ।।
