Dear Ashok,

I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on what is likely. Nāsāv 
ṛṣir yasya mataṃ na bhinnam, :-) and there are many elements that may go 
into an emendation. To me, the verse in question does indeed seem rather 
cliché-like, making  the formulaic yāvac candraprabhākarau appear more 
likely than it does to you. But of course I may be wrong.

Martin
