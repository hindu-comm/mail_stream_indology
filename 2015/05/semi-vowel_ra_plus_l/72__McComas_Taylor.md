Dear Colleagues


We always follow the convention that when the semi-vowel ra is the first letter in a conjunct consonant cluster, it is written above the line as far to the right in the syllable as possible. E.g. in sarva?, it would be printed over the a .


A sharp-eyed student has noted that Lanman does not appear to follow this convention when the following vowel is a  -  Lanman consistently prints the ra over the first following consonant in a consonant cluster - in the example above, over the va.


E.g. p. 1 l.17, p2 l. 8, p.2 l.12


Can any colleague provide a justification for Lanman's approach?


Thanks in advance


McC
