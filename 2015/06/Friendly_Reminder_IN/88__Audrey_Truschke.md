Dear Colleagues,

This is a friendly reminder that the best way to converse on INDOLOGY is
with messages that are concise and on point. As a rule of thumb, one
screen-full of text is a good benchmark.

On this issue, I invite everybody to review the membership guidelines
<http://indology.info/email/email-const/>, especially paragraph 7.

Many thanks.

Audrey Truschke (INDOLOGY committee member on duty)
