The article has this sentence:

So much so that 3,500 years later, modern Indians would celebrate the
language of these ancient pastoral nomads all the way out in Bangkok city.

The sentence matches with the earlier part of the article, if  'ancient
pastoral nomads' is improved as 'ancient pastoral charioteer
horse-trainer-book-writing mercenary hymn-singing hymn-documenting nomads'
