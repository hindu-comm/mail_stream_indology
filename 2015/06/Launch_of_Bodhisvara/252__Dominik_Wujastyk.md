Despite the wealth of Sanskrit Buddhist literature accessible to us today,
very little of it is available in audio form.
We hope that by making these recordings available, there will be a greater
appreciation of this treasury of wisdom which contains jewels of
unsurpassable beauty.
The first project published on the website is a recording of
Śāntideva’s *Bodhicaryāvatāra
*recited by Prof. Kashinath Nyaupane.

We hope you will enjoy the recordings, and share the link with your friends
and colleagues.

We chose the auspicious date of Saga Dawa, Vesakh according to the Tibetan
Calendar, to launch the website, as an homage to the Buddha's awakening and
legacy.

With my best wishes,

Christian Bernert
