Language: Sanskrit, English. *1200**Rs (52 €).*ISBN: 978-81-8470-205-7 
(IFP) / 978-2-85539-151-9 (EFEO).

Transmitted to us in a well-preserved ninth-century Nepalese manuscript, 
the /Niśvāsatattvasaṃhitā/ has come in recent years to be recognised as 
probably the oldest surviving complete scripture of the 
Mantramārga.Although its historical importance has been hinted at by a 
range of scholars across the twentieth century, this is the first time 
its text appears in print.


This volume presents a critical edition and annotated translation of the 
three earliest layers of the text: the /Mūlasūtra/, /Uttarasūtra/ and 
/Nayasūtra/. The topics dealt with include cosmology, rituals of worship 
and initiation, and forms of yoga. A lengthy introduction sets these 
/sūtra/s in context, in particular by examining the evidence for dating 
them. There follow a summary of their contents, an account of the early 
manuscript and its three twentieth-century apographs, and a treatment of 
the various ways in which the language of the Niśvāsa deviates from 
Pāṇinian norms.
