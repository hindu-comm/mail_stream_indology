*/Bhāṭṭatantrarahasyam. The Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya of Khaṇḍadeva with the 
Sāraprakāśikā commentary by N. S. Ramanuja Tatacharya/**. *

N. S. Ramanuja Tatacharya; associate editor S. Lakshminarasimham, 
Regards sur l'Asie du Sud / South Asian Perspectives n˚ 4, Institut 
Français de Pondichéry,xxi, 664 p., 2015.

Language: Sanskrit. *1200 Rs (52 **€**).*ISBN : 978-81-8470-204-0.

The /Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya/ of Khaṇḍadeva (17th c.) belongs to the Bhāṭṭa 
school of Mīmāṃsā. It deals mainly with the meaning of roots and 
suffixes, and their role in conveying the meaning of the sentence. 
Though this is a topic of grammar, it is widely discussed in Nyāya and 
Mīmāṃsā works as well. The /Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya /is divided into two 
parts. The first part begins with the definition of /dharma/, the main 
concept of Mīmāṃsā, and then deals at length with the meaning of 
injunctional suffix (/liṅ/), refuting the views of logicians and 
establishing /bhāvanā /(creative energy) as the main meaning of the 
sentence. In the second part, the author discusses the meaning of 
nominal suffixes (/sup/), quoting relevant rules from Pāṇinian grammar. 
Though Khaṇḍadeva's interpretation of Pāṇinian rules deviates from the 
grammatical tradition in some cases, he tries to prove that there is no 
violation of grammar by the Mīmāṃsakas.

Given the complexity of the /Bhāṭṭatantrarahasya/, Prof. Ramanuja 
Tatacharya presents it here with his own commentary, the 
/Sāraprakāśikā/. Also included are an index of the Pāṇinian rules, an 
index of the /k//ā//rik//ā/s (citations) and a bibliography.
