Subject: [INDOLOGY] Request, Kamaleswar Bhattacharya review of Claus Oetke,     "Ich" und das Ich

Dear Indologists,

Does anyone have easy access to this book review? No library now accessible to me has it, and I have not found it online.

Kamaleswar Bhattacharya review of Claus Oetke, "Ich" und das Ich: Analytische Untersuchungen zur buddhistisch-brahmanischen Ātmankontroverse. In Bulletin d'Études Indiennes, vol. 9, 1991, pp. 279-281.

I would greatly appreciate a scan of it. Thanks!

Best regards,

David Reigle
