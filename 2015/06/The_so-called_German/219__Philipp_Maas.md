Dear Colleagues,

I just came along the recent publication by Adluri and Bagchee entitled
“The Nay Science. A History of German Indology,” (Oxford, New York: Oxford
University Press, 2014). This book claims on its first page to demonstrate
that “the application of the text-historical method [the authors use this
term as a synonym for historical-critical methods in general] is not
scientific [their translation of “wissenschaftlich”], … in the majority of
cases, the textual histories German scholars came up with using this method
were a projection of their fantasies.”



In reading these lines, I get quite puzzled. Are historical-critical
methods in general flawed, or only when practiced by Germans?





I would be grateful for suggestions.





With best wishes,



Philipp Maas
