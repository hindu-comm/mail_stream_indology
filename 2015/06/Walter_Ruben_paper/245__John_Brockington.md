Dear James,

The article was also published, according to my records, as:

Ruben, Walter 1964-65: “The Minister Jābāli in Vālmīki’s Rāmāyaṇa”, 
/Indian Studies Past and Present/6: 443-66.

However, I do not have a copy of it (either as a scan or a photocopy), 
so I cannot help directly.  I would be pleased to have a copy myself, if 
anyone is able to provide it.

Best wishes

John
