Dear Members,

I am looking for a scan of this book in 3 vols.:

Sāhityaratnākara of Dharmasūri : with Naukā of Carla Veṅkaṭasūri and
Mandara of Mallādi Lakṣmaṇa SūriSanskrit Academy series ; 21, 22,
24; Hyderabad
: Osmania University

As I am looking for a particular passage (6.14) dealing with the
construction of nāgabandhas, the page concerned will suffice (it should be
in vol.2)...
Anyone willing to share?

Best,

Alessandro Battistini
PhD Candidate
Sapienza Università di Roma
