Dear Colleagues,

I would like to ask if perhaps anybody knows something
more about Govindanātha from Kerala, the author of

Śaṅkara's hagiography - *Śaṅkarācāryacarita *also called

*Keralīya-Śaṅkaravijaya *(dated for ca. 17th century, although this dating is

rather doubtful)?
I would be really grateful for any information,

Olga Nowicka
