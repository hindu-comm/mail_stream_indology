My name is Rocco Cestola and i'ma PhD candidate of the University of
Roma "La Sapienza". My research topic is based on establish a critical
edition of a work ascribed to Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa entitled
"Pātañjalayogasūtravṛtti".

Consulting the New Catalogus Catalogorum I've discovered that a
manuscript of this text is referred in a Catalogue edited by the Bihar
and Orissa Research Society, Patna. The New Catalogus Catalogorum
reports this information:

A Descriptive Catalogue of Manuscripts in Mithilā, published by the
Bihar and Orissa Research Society, Patna


I'm kindly request, if it might be possible, to receive informations
and, accordingly, contacts regards the mentioned Institute where the
manuscript is located.

with immense gratitude and with best regards

Rocco Cestola
