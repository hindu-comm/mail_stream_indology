Dear all,

Would you please guide me to all published / manuscripts / works / theses
related to phiTsUtras?

I am jotting down the books which I already have

2. siddhAntakaumudI with tattvabodhinI
3. prauDhamanoramA
4. prakriyAkaumudI with viTThala's commentary
5. zAntanava's phiTsUtra by Kielhorn
6. svarasiddhAntacandrikA of zrInivAsayajva.

Any addition in form of link / PDF would be appreciated.
