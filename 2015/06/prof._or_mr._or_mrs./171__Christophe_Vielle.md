Jo(h)annes Ernestus Hanxleden and Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo  are remembered in Malayalam tradition as, respectively,  arṇṇōsŭ pātiri  (‘Father Ernest(o)’) and paulinōsŭ pātiri  ('Father Paulinos'). I suppose that their Indian name was something accepted and used by themselves in the local context.
