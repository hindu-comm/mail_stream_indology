I wonder if this is more akin to the (as far as I know, only British) usage
such as Sir William, Sir James, with no mention made of family name?
A quick and entirely unscientific google research (you know, like how our
students often 'do research') yielded plenty of ghits of "Father + [first
name only]"

so... (as with much 'research', no conclusion)
