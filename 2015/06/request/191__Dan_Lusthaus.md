I thank Prof. Paturi for his suggestion, but the "conditions for getting access" make this option non-viable (basically one has to get an institutional librarian to subscribe to their service).

Does anyone have a less daunting way of acquiring a PDF of Jha's Praśastapāda translation?

Thanks, again.

  But there are conditions for getting access to download.
