Dear list members,

Muni Puṇyavijaya presented a paper titled 'Jain Āgamadhar aur Prākṛt
Vāṅmaya' at the All-India Oriental Conference at Srinagar in 1961. The
paper is not in vol. 2 part 1 of the proceedings, but it might be in the
"summaries" (also edited, as far as I know, by V. Raghavan), which I don't
presently have access to. Can anyone kindly check if Puṇyavijayajī's paper
is included, and if so, what the page range is? Of course I would be
grateful for a scan.

with thanks,

Andrew
