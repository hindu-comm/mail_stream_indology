Dear List,

The pādas: yad idaṃ vedavacanaṃ kuru karma tyajeti ca /  occur with minor variations four times in the Mahābhārata.

Can anybody guide me to a Vedic text that says kuru karma tyaja or something like it? I have had a quick look at a few texts, but come up with nothing.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,

Greg Bailey
