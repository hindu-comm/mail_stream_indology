Writing from my temporary home in Delhi, those of you interested in the Amartya Sen and Nalanda University fiasco, my profitably read these two essays. The first is by a friend, Pratap Bhanu Mehta (who taught at Harvard). He is a very incisive and insightful public intellectual and analyst of Indian politics and society.

With best wishes from monsoon soaked Delhi,
