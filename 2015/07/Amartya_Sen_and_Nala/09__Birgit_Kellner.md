To quote from Scharfe, Education in Ancient India, 2002, p. 162:

"... Their intellectual level was quite forbidding: "Of those from
abroad who wished to enter the schools of discussion the majority,
beaten by the difficulties of the problems, withdrew; and those who were
deeply versed in old and modern learning were admitted, only two
or three out of ten succeeding." This statement of Hsuan-tsang does not
prove a formal Matriculation Examination as has been suggested, rather a
testing or more likely self-testing of prospective students; those who
felt inadequate withdrew. For Vikramasila, Tibetan sources suggest that
the "gate scholars" (dvara-pandita) guarded the admission
process."

(The "suggestion" to which Scharfe refers comes from Mookerji,
Education, p. 564, but there already seems to be an older disagreement
on how to interpret Xuanzang at this point, as Scharfe also cites St.
Julien and Watters.)

There are references to a kind of test, or entrance rite, but I would
agree with Jonathan that there is no solid basis for "knowing" about
admission processes for study at Nalanda -- what has been written about
this comes from Yijing or Xuanzang, supplemented with accounts found in
later Tibetan historiographies (Tāranātha, for instance). And gaps are
filled in with some speculation, as Scharfe's account demonstrates.

But to what degree Xuanzang's or Tāranātha's accounts might have been
filtered by the perspectives of the respective authors, or, in the case
of Chinese pilgrims, processes of cultural translation -- narrating
about Indian affairs in ways a Chinese target audience could understand,
possibly tacitly translating social categories --, is an open question.
A really interesting one, though!

Best regards, Birgit Kellner
