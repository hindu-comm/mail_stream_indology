Dear colleagues,


I would like to read Jean Filliozat's article "Le Yoga et les substances
psychotropes" that was published in
the journal 
**
*Y*
*oga *
*et*
* *
*V*
*ie*
num. 26
, in 1978
.

The journal is published by lâ€™Association du Centre de Relations
Culturelles Franco-Indien, who have written to me offering an annual
subscription to the current issue of the journal.  The organization took a
year to send me this response.  Before I start wrangling with them about
the specific issue of their journal, I thought I'd ask INDOLOGY.

Can you help with this?

Many thanks,
Dominik Wujastyk
