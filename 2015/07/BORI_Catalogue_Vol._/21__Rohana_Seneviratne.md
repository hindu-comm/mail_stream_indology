Dear List,

If anybody has got a handy PDF of the second volume of Descriptive Catalogue of the Government Collections of Manuscripts deposited at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (1938), please kindly share it with me.

http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/504518766

Unfortunately this particular volume is not available in the excellent collection of MSS catalogues Prof. Wujastyk has shared online.

Thank you very much in advance.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
