Thanks for sharing this Audrey. I feel we should launch some kind of
petition and express a collective condemnation. This is so totally
unacceptable that we have to respond as a scholarly community.

I am not sure whether it would be more effective to address the petition to
Malhotra himself, demanding that he admit his guilt and apologize, or would
it be more worthwhile to address it to the publishers in question?

Best,J
