Subject: [INDOLOGY] Developing story on alleged plagiarism by Rajiv Malhotra

Dear Colleagues,

List members may be interested in the growing story of alleged plagiarism of several scholars, including a list member, by Rajiv Malhotra. The story has been largely developing on twitter (#message4rajiv). Also see the nice summary on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/3c8quf/confirmed_widespread_plagiarism_found_in_hindu/
