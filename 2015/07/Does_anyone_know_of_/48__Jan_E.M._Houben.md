Dag Herman,
This is an interesting observation, no doubt relevant for the history of
the intertwined sanskritic and prakritic traditions (and yes, the
traditions of tamil kannada malayalam language metrics/poetics and
literature are also somehow intertwined, but how).
Do you have any examples as illustration for those who do not have the
mentioned publications on their lap (or in their laptop)?
Hartelijke groet,
jan
