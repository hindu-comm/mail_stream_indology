Let me respond to North-South part here, second syllable rhyming part in
the next post.

Prof. Goodall said:

>The South seems always long to have been more conscious of the North than the North has been of the South.

1. dakshiNAnila for malyAnila is a usage found throughout Sanskrit
literature and other literatures northern and southern.

2. Bhatrihari mentions dAkShiNAtyas in

यः पातञ्जलिशिष्यॆभ्यॊ भ्रष्टॊ व्याकरणागमः /

कालॆन दाक्षिणात्यॆषु ग्रन्थमात्रॊ व्यवस्थितः // वाक्य_२।४८५ //


similar mention of dAkShiNAtya, dakShiNa may be remembered by other
list members.
