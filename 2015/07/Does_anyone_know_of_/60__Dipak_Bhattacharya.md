Among the most popular pieces of poems -- often selected for recitation by
children -- is the Śivatāṇḍavastotra, ascribed to Rāvaṇa, which rhymes its
second syllables up to the 14th that is the last-but-one verse. Its date is
not known but could be anterior to the emergence of Vaiṣṇavism as a strong
contender against Ṣaivism which could be prior to the ninth century CE. But
that is uncertain.
