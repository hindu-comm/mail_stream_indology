Colleagues,

I admire Dominik for his immediate public correction of an earlier remark of his. However, if I had known that he was going to forward my communication to the List, I would have made its wording a little bit more grammatical and not allowed it to retain its ‘note-to-a-friend’ form. Please delete “about” from “not about a marker” and change “his sentence” to “his/her sentence”. It would also have been better if I had alerted Dominik with some such heading as “Not for forwarding to the List, at least not yet.”. Sorry for the extra reading you all had to do.

a.a.
