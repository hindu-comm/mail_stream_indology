> I have not entered this discussion yet, but given that we have turned to the fruitful discussion of plagiarism in the ancient world (not just India), a book that many of you may find interesting and illumination is Ehrman's work on early Christian literature. It is not on plagiarism per se (which passes of others' work as one's own) but the opposite, forgery, (which tries to pass of one's own work as that of someone else).

I myself am interested in this approach to what I see as the modularity of Buddhist scriptural literature, although the notion of modular composition is not exactly the same as text reuse as generally understood.
