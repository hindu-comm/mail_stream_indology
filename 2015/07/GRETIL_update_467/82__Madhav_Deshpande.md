Dear Reinhold,

     The header of the file for Śabdavyāpāravicāra reads:

  Mammata: Sabdavyaparavicara
Based on the ed. by Mangesh Ramkrishna Telang: Abhidhāvṛttimātrikā of
Mukula Bhatta and Śabdavyāpāravicāra of Rājānaka Mahimabhaṭṭa,
Bombay : Nirnaya Sagar Press, 1916.

Is there a dispute over authorship of this text.  The header suggests that
the edition of Mammaṭa's Śabdavyāpāravicāra is based on the edition of
Śabdavyāpāravicāra of Rājānaka Mahimabhaṭṭa.  I am wondering if there is
some error involved in this reference.

Madhav
