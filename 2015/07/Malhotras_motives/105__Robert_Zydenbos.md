I could not fail to notice that that odd website
https://traditionresponds.wordpress.com/ (made by heroically anonymous
"Independent Readers and Reviewers") presents itself as "Tradition
Responds" and a "Rebuttal of false allegations against Hindu scholarship".

If "Hindu scholarship" and "Tradition" mean that one may (or must?)
shamelessly copy stuff from Nicholson, Olender and who else (like
"Halfbass"), then one wonders what traditional Hindu scholarship and
tradition, in the eyes of those "Independent Readers and Reviewers", is
worth. Shame on them.
