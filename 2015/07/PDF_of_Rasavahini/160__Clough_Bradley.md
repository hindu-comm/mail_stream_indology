Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have a PDF or a copy that they could make into a PDF of the following:

Telwatte Rahula, An Edition of the Rasavahini-Jambudipuppattivathu, Together with an English Translation (Ph.D. dissertation at the Australian National University [Canberra, Australia], date unknown).

Thanks in advance!


Brad
