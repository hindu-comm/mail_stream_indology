I would be most grateful if someone could post (or email me) the latest ideas about the date of the Bhagavatam. Working mostly with Tamil, I’m not in the loop about such matters and I need to say something in the introduction to my translation of the Akanāṉūṟu. (Of course, I will acknowledge any help). Thanks. George Hart
