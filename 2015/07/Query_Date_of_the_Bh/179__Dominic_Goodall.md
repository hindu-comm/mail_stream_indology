Friedhelm Hardy’s very significant observations in Viraha-Bhakti on the indebtedness of the Bhāgavatapurāṇa to the Tamil poetry of the Āḻvārs should surely be mentioned here !

As I have pointed out in annotation to a translation of Bhāgavata X, chapter 31, the second-syllable rhyming used in passages of heightened emotion is further evidence of this Tamilian influence. The style of the work, as many have observed, really stands out from amongst other run-of-the-mill Purāṇas.

And one should also consider Charlotte Schmid’s observations based on South Indian narrative sculpture about Kṛṣṇa : “Aventures divines de Kṛṣṇa : la līlā et les traditions narratives des temples cōḻa” in Arts Asiatiques 2002.

In view of all this, such early dates as C7th and C8th seem implausible and such late ones as 1200 seem very unlikely.

As we all know, the continuing upabṛṃhaṇa, expansion or supplementation, of the purāṇas makes them almost impossible to date accurately. Since their older parts may be separated from their later parts by centuries, are we seeking the date of their latest redaction?

Institute of Learning and Research, Ahmedabad, 1996-1999), an "Epilogue" volume was published in 2002 (vol. 4, part 3), which has just over two pages on "Time and Composition of the BGP" (pp. 15-17). K. K. Shastree there concludes (p. 16): "It means that the time of composing the BGP is not earlier than the latter half of the 7th cent., A.D. and not later than the first half of the 8th cent., A.D."

Since this Jaina text can be dated around 500 C.E., some version of the Bhāgavata-purāṇa existed then. This is in his section, "The Date and Authorship of the Bh.P.," pp. xxxiv-xlii. He begins this section by listing thirteen proposed dates for the Bhāgavata-purāṇa, ranging from 1200 B.C. to 1300 A.D., and their sources. Included here is the date proposed by

Working mostly with Tamil, I’m not in the loop about such matters and I need to say something in the introduction to my translation of the Akanāṉūṟu. (Of course, I will acknowledge any help). Thanks.
