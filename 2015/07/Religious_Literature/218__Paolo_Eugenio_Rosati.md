I complitely agree.
But why "we" talk about "sanskritisation" phenomena if a goddess and her
devotional cult are dominated by tribal elements? I would like to describe
this goddesses as "tribalised", maybe because they represent a manipulation
of the "mainstream" Hindu Devi, to whom are overimposed tribal elements.

If the sanskritisation (or brahmanisation) process can be described as a
vertical axis where are different degrees of sanskritisation; maybe we
could describe this axis with two poles: one "sanskritisation", the other
"tribalisation"... obviously the dialectic between cultures bring to hybrid
phenomenon, but in my opinion the Hindu-Assamese culture is widely
dominated by tribal traditions, and this probably depend by ancient politic
needs.

Best,
Paolo

P.S.: Maybe someone has a pdf copy of Kunal Chakrabarti "Religious
Processes: The Puranas and the Making of a Regional Tradition" (2001).
