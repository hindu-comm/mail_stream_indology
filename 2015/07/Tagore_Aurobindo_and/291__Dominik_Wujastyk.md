Arlo, plagiarism doesn't, according to the various public definitions,
depend on intention.  There is no distinction - formally speaking - between
sloppiness and plagiarism.  This has already been discussed, about a week
ago ("manslaugher vs. murder").

This is an error that people make about copyright too.  "For scholarly
purposes" means nothing, under the law.   Breaching copyright means
physically *...making...a...copy*.  It doesn't matter why.  If you copy
something physically, without permission, you've breached the
copyright-holder's rights.  It's Act, not Intent.

Best,
Dominik
