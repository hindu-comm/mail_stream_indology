Dear list,

Can anyone help me identifying the character that appears twice in the 
third word in the attached image, i.e. below धर्म ध्यांन?

The image represents a square of a (poorly scanned) gyan chaupar 
painting from early 19th century Bikaner, Rajasthan. I would expect the 
reading श्रेणि here, but it could easily be something else. I have met 
with this character several times, but never in a context where I could 
be absolutely certain of its interpretation.

Any help much appreciated.

Best,
Jacob
