Dear Colleagues,
I may relate a similar experience with a much more low profile book by
me -*-Mythological
and rirtual symbolism* 1984 Calcutta. The fourth and fifth chapters (194 -
208) were verbatim copied without any acknowledgement or reference to my
work in a book published by a reputed publisher of Delhi. I wrote to them,
they did not reply. My solicitor advised purchasing a copy for production
if I wanted to start legal proceedings. I wanted to purchase. Again, the
publishers were silent. In the mean time my book went out of print.
It requires so much energy and resources to carry on legal proceedings that
one engaged in work often gives up.
With best wishes for all and collegial sympathy for co-sufferers.
