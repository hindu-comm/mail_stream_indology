Dear All,

I am looking for a digital version (not a photo scan but a keyed in or
edited OCR-ed version) of Laghusiddhāntakaumudī (James R Ballantyne
Translation or any other if not the Ballantyne edition).

If anyone knows of any such edition or something similar I would most
appreciate.

Kindest Wishes,

Martin
