Dear Members,
 I am looking for a PhD thesis submitted by Minoru  Hara at Harvard
 'Materials for the study of Pasupata Saivism' in 1966. Though i am not
sure but still its unpublished. Is it possible to access the thesis in pdf
form? Also i will appreciate if some one could send me the pdf of
Pasupata sutram, with Panchartha-Bhasya of Kaundinya. Translated with an
introd. on the history of Saivism in India [by] Haripada Chakraborti

Best Regards
Diwakar Kumar Singh
University of Delhi
