I am much grateful to Walter Slaje, Christophe Vielle, Roland Steiner, Dipak Bhattacharya and Madhav Deshpande, who very kindly provided me the reference and reading materials on it.

Now it is certain that the verse does not appear in the Rājataraṅginī as many works and websites erroneously mention. It is found first mentioned in the Sahyādrikhaṇḍa.
Thanking all of you again and the indology listserv,


Best Wishes,
Rohana

Hello Rohana,

     I have attached an article of mine that discusses these and similar verses, and the division of Gauḍa and Drāviḍa.

Dear All,

I will be very much thankful if you could kindly help me locate the following verse in Kalhaṇa's Rājataraṅginī, which describes the ten classes of Brahmins. Many secondary works cite it as appearing in the Rājataraṅginī but does not give the exact reference.

“karṇāṭakāś ca tailaṅgā drāviḍā mahārāṣṭrakāḥ gurjarāś ceti pancaiva drāviḍā vindhyadakṣiṇe | sārasvatāḥ kānyakubjā gauḍā utkalamaithilāḥ pañcagauḍā iti khyātā vindhyasyottaravāsinaḥ.”

[The five Drāviḍa classes (Pañca Drāviḍas) living to the south of the Vindhyā (mountain range) are Karṇāṭakas (in Karnataka), Tailaṅgas (in Andhra), Drāviḍas (in Tamilnadu and Kerala), those in Mahārāṣṭra and those in Gurjaras (in Gujarat). Sārasvatas (in Punjab, Kashmir & Sindh), Kānyakubjas (in Uttar Pradesh), Gauḍas (in Kurukshetra and Rajasthan), Utkalas (in Orissa), and Maithilīs (in Bihar) living to the north of the Vindhya are known as the five Gauḍa classes (Pañca Gauḍas.)].

Thank you very much in advance.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
