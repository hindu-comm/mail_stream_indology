Dominik, the justification on those grounds would go something like this.

Malhotra defends "tradition," which is embodied in Sanskrit texts. 
Therefore, he is not bound by any modern academic conventions because he 
follows the traditional system, the one expressed in Sanskrit. And if 
“Sanskrit does not even have quotation marks in its character set,” why 
would he, a defender of the "tradition," use them.

The use of /iti/ has already been mentioned, so the whole justification 
is, of course, /null and void/, even from a 'traditional' point of view.
