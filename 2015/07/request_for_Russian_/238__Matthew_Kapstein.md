Dear colleagues,

Although Vasili'ev's Буддизм, его догматы, история и литература
seems to be available in pdf from several Russian sites, all that I
have found so far require some sort of pre-inscription and/or payment,
and because my Russian is rudimentary, I am wary of using such sites for
download.

I would be most grateful, therefore, to whomever might be able to
send me a pdf of the work in question.

with thanks and best regards,
Matthew
