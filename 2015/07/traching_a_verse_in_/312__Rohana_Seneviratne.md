Dear All,

I will be very much thankful if you could kindly help me locate the following verse in Kalhaṇa's Rājataraṅginī, which describes the ten classes of Brahmins. Many secondary works cite it as appearing in the Rājataraṅginī but does not give the exact reference.

“karṇāṭakāś ca tailaṅgā drāviḍā mahārāṣṭrakāḥ gurjarāś ceti pancaiva drāviḍā vindhyadakṣiṇe | sārasvatāḥ kānyakubjā gauḍā utkalamaithilāḥ pañcagauḍā iti khyātā vindhyasyottaravāsinaḥ.”

[The five Drāviḍa classes (Pañca Drāviḍas) living to the south of the Vindhyā (mountain range) are Karṇāṭakas (in Karnataka), Tailaṅgas (in Andhra), Drāviḍas (in Tamilnadu and Kerala), those in Mahārāṣṭra and those in Gurjaras (in Gujarat). Sārasvatas (in Punjab, Kashmir & Sindh), Kānyakubjas (in Uttar Pradesh), Gauḍas (in Kurukshetra and Rajasthan), Utkalas (in Orissa), and Maithilīs (in Bihar) living to the north of the Vindhya are known as the five Gauḍa classes (Pañca Gauḍas.)].

Thank you very much in advance.

Best Wishes,
Rohana
