Dear List,


I will be very much thankful if any of you would like to kindly share with me a PDF of the following work.

K.A. Subramania IYER (ed.) 1973. Vākyapadīya of Bhartṛhari: with the Prakīrṇakaprakāśa of Helārāja. Kāṇḍa III, part ii. Poona : Deccan College.

*Please note that I am looking for Part ii of the third Kāṇḍa.

The only copy at the Oriental Institute, Oxford is now misplaced, as I was told. Thank you very much for any help in advance.


Best Wishes,
R
