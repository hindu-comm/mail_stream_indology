Dear Friends,

I am looking for a clear recording of the chanting of the Aṣṭādhyāyī with
correct pronunciation and intonation that could be used online. Sufficient
silence should be there between each sūtra to split the file accordingly
(if it is not already split by sūtra).

If anyone has such a recording that could be used or knows where it could
be found I would be most grateful.

With Warmest Wishes,

Martin Gluckman
