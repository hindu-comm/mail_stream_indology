Dear colleagues,

It is my painful duty to convey to you the sad news of the death of our 
fellow student and former colleague Dr. Albrecht Hanisch. After a prolonged 
illness, at the age of 51, he passed away peacefully on July 26, 2015 in Bad 
Harzburg, Germany. Albrecht studied in Marburg theology, indology, and 
tibetology. In 2000 he earned his doctorate under Professor Michael Hahn 
(1941–2014) with a work on Āryaśūra's Jātakamālā. From 2007 until 2014 he 
worked as a local representative of the Nepalese-German Manuscript 
Cataloguing Project and an acting director of the Nepal Research Centre in 
Kathmandu, Nepal. His friends and colleagues will miss him.

A memorial service will take place on August 15, 2015 at 4 p.m. in Bad 
Harzburg. Relatives, friends, and colleagues are cordially invited to attend.

Condolences may be sent to Albrecht's wife Anna Hanisch 
(annakbhanisch at googlemail.com).

Kind regards,
Dragomir Dimitrov
