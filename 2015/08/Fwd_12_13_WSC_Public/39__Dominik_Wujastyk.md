Announcements from publishers promoting their publications are *strictly

We all know and respect MLBD.  There is no need to publicise their
publications here, nor those of any other publishing house.  If we open
that door, the list will degenerate into mere advertising.

Please, please respect the guidelines of the forum
<http://indology.info/email/email-const/>!  See paragraph 8.

Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee.
