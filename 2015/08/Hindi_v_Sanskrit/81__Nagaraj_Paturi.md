Can the Vedic Sanskrit Prakrit NP-NP structure be considered as Dravidian
influence?

                                    ------------------ Nagaraj

So, I would say that the similarities between Sanskrit and (early)
Dravidian are superficial; their overall predicate syntax differs
considerably.

Answer to Nagaraj's question from Prof. Hans Henrich Hock :

No, the Vedic Sanskrit Prakrit NP-NP structure can not be considered as
Dravidian influence.

Am I right ?
