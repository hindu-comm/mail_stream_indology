This clarification is indeed welcome.
If it is shared by the listowner and other committee members, Indology's
Scope and Guidelines dating from 10 July 2001 could in the same spirit be
modified: esp. under 2 "Membership": leave out the first two sentences
dealing with "accredited scholars" (MA and PhD degrees typically
"happen off list") and the third one on those having a "scholarly
commitment".
This further makes the paragraph on "Special exceptions", also under 2,
superfluous.
A minority of the current Indology members could then reflect on a New
International Indology Forum for "accredited scholars" not necessarily in
the unwieldy form of a List but for instance as Bulletin Board, avoiding
unnecessary loops and repetitions.
Incidentally, Dean, could lengthy threads also be a function of the number
of members on vacation or holiday? Mine is now over so I will no longer
"plague" on this topic.
