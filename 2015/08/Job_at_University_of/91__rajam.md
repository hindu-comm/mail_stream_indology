What’s the deadline for sending in the application? 

Should the letters of recommendation be sent separately or together with the application?

Way back when I was applying for jobs, the letters of recommendation were to be sealed and sent along with the application. I’d like to know about the current protocol, so I can guide some youngsters accordingly.

Thanks and regards,
rajam
