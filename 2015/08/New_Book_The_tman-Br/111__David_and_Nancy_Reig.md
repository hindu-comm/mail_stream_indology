A corrected reprint of this book with a new introduction has now been
issued. A number of typographical errors were corrected, mostly in the
extensive notes. Anyone who purchased the first release may contact me
off-list for a replacement.

As a result of feedback after the first release, I felt it necessary to add
a new introduction. This was written by myself. It has been posted
separately at Academia.edu:

> Subject: [INDOLOGY] New Book: The Ātman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism
>
> Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s 1973 French book, *L’Ātman-Brahman dans le
> Bouddhisme ancien*, has just been published in English translation as *The
> Ātman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism*. It is available from Amazon.com at:
> http://www.amazon.com/Atman-Brahman-Ancient-Buddhism-Kamaleswar-Bhattacharya/dp/0881810061.
> I do not know if the publication of this book was his last wish, because he
> died unexpectedly on March 16, 2014, but I have regarded it as such, as far
> as my duty in getting it published is concerned. Here follows some brief
> information about how this came about.
>
>
> I first contacted him about an English translation of this book in 2001.
> At that time he already had a typescript English translation of it, made by
> someone other than himself, whose name we never learned. From this
> typescript, faint and nearly illegible in parts, with many handwritten
> corrections and changes added, my wife Nancy input an electronic copy. A
> printout of this was mailed to Prof. Bhattacharya for his corrections and
> revisions. Over the course of several years, due to his many other
> commitments, revised printouts went back and forth between France and the
> U.S.A. several times. In the end, he had the book as he wanted it. We were
> awaiting the four indexes when we learned of his passing.
>
>
> As for the content of this book, its thesis is, as stated in his Preface:
> “the Buddha does not deny the Upaniṣadic *ātman*; on the contrary, he
> indirectly affirms it, *in denying that which is falsely believed to be
> the**ātman*.”
>
>
> He continues: “The one request I would make of such eminent scholars as
> have devoted their lives to the study of Buddhism is that they adopt a
> genuinely Buddhist attitude and read this book before saying, ‘That is
> impossible.’”
