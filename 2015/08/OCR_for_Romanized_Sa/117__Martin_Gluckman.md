Dear All,

If anyone has worked rather extensively with Abbyy for OCR with romanized
Sanskrit texts with diacritics and is happy to share their supplementary
recognition file resulted from the training of Abbyy on such texts we would
be most grateful.

We are planning to OCR a number of texts and it would be great not to have
to train Abbyy from 0 through I must say the latest versions are very good
at recognizing diacritics if you simply type a sample of the character into
the additional character set option in the software.

There is reference to this planning to be made available in this post in
2010
<http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2010-May/034550.html>
but
thereafter I have not seen further in this regard.

FYI: "You can save the trained pattern via menu TOOLS > OPTIONS > tab READ
> "User patterns and languages"."

Kindest Wishes,

Martin Gluckman
