Yes,

this feature which you mention ("the initial vowels must agree in 
quantity") is an important feature,
and, interestingly, it must have been TOO OBVIOUS TO STATE,
from the point of view of the Tolkāppiyam,
because the first Tolkāppiyam sūtra explaining etukai
is the second element in a pair of sūtras,
which state (elliptically)

TP397i
aṭitoṟun talaiyeḻut toppatu mōṉai
(= aṭitoṟum talai eḻuttu oppatu mōṉai).

"That in which the head-/eḻuttu/ in every /aṭi/ is equal is /mōṉai/."

TP398i
aḵtoḻit toṉṟi ṉetukai yākum
(=aḵtu oḻittu oṉṟiṉ etukai ākum).

"If, that being omitted, there is identity, it will be /etukai/."

These sūtras have been earlier preceded by a sūtra which explains the 
larger category of /toṭai/ and which states

TP393i
mōṉai yetukai muraṇē yiyaipeṉa
nāṉeṟi marapiṉa toṭaivakai yeṉpa.
(mōṉai etukai muraṇē iyaipu eṉa
nāl neṟi marapiṉa toṭai vakai eṉpa.)

"They say that the subdivisions of traditionally four-pathed /toṭai/ 
are: (1) mōṉai, (2) etukai, (3) muraṇ "contrast" and (4) iyaipu


The third element, muraṇ, and the fourth element, iyaipu, are 
characterized in:

TP400i
moḻiyiṉum poruḷiṉu muraṇutaṉ muraṇē.
(= moḻiyiṉum poruḷiṉum muraṇutal muraṇē.)

"The contrasting either in word or in meaning is /muraṇ/."


TP401i
iṟuvā yoppiṉaḵ tiyaipeṉa moḻipa.
(= iṟuvāy oppiṉ aḵtu iyaipu eṉa moḻipa.)

They call /iyaipu/ that in which final is identical;
