Dear Prof. Hart,

It was Prof. Kevin M. Ryan who mentioned Proto-South-Dravidian but that was
in the context of a certain variety of ER and not SSR.

Tracing back /reconstructing metrical features in terms of proto forms is a
challenging task.

There was no discussion on those lines at least in this thread.

Bh. Krishnamurti places Telugu in a newly formed southern-central
sub-family in his recent book.

But that is not related to this thread.

Thanks for joining the interesting discussion.

I know that you like it.

Regards,

Nagaraj
