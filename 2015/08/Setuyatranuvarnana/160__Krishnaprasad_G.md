Namaste

Dear all

I am searching for details of the work Setuyatranuvarnana by T Ganapaty
Shastri.

In the book History of Sanskrit Literature by Krsnamacariar mentions that
the MS of the work is in his home(even I tried contacting his grandchildren
but no success), but in the book Kaumudikatha Kallolini the name of the
work is quoted which leads to suspect that the work would have printed
after 1930s.

Please if any one knows the details of the edition of the book let me know.

Yours sincerely
Krishnaprasad

Thanks
