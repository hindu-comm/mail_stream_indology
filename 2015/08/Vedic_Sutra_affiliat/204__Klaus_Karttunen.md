Dear Colleagues,
I dont know the answer (but like very much to learn it), but one fact is that at least in some parts of India Ṛgveda is considered more prestigious than others. I have met Brahmans in South India, who proudly announce to belong to Rigveda, but when asked about their Shakha, admit to belong to Apastamba.

Best,
Klaus

However, what is the ritual affiliation for those Brahmins who are traditionally called Dvivedi, Trivedi and Chaturvedi?  Do they have concurrent multiple Vedic/Sutra affiliations?  I was told by the Ratate family in Banaras that their personal Vedic affiliation is with Ṛgveda, and yet academically/professionally they became Atharvavedins.  I am wondering if the situation with Dvivedis, Trivedis and Chaturvedis is similar, in the sense that they academically study two, three or four Vedas, and yet have a particular one Veda as their family affiliation.  Any information, including textual references, would be helpful.  With best wishes,
