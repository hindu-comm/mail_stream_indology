<Any information (on the relation between Vedic affiliation and ritual),
including textual references, would be helpful.>

I shall state one point about the status of Vedic affiliation in tradition
and the Śāstras. One sees that among followers of tradition, affiliation to
a particular Veda is something immutable. But this position could not be
very old. Is there any relevant rule in the late Vedic scripture or the
Dharmaṥāstras on that? One finds gotra rules of endogamy and exogamy
(Baudhāyana) but none about Vedic affiliation. It must have been later that
the situation gained a static position. I myself suffered from objection
raised against my (and earlier my father’s) working on the Atharvaveda. The
particular word used by the person, revered by many, when he came to know
that I was a Ṛgvedin, was so demeaning that I cannot print it here. But is
not this strictness non-Ṥāstric? As far as I know there is no Ṥāstric
entity as Ṛgvedin or Sāmavedin or Yajurvedin.

It is not impossible that Dayānand Sarasvati knew the position of the
Ṥāstras in this regard. He changed his object in Vedic study and was not
quite vocal about his Vedic affiliation. He was in agreement with the
scriptures in that.

If my idea is not correct someone may kindly point out.
