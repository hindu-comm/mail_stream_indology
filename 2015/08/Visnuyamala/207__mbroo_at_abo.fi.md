Dear list members,

While looking for verses quoted in a late Tantric text, I came across  
a reference to a text called Visnuyamala. As far as I understand, this  
is an unpublished text, but if anyone has any information about it (or  
even better, mss scans!), I would be most thankful.

Sincerely
Måns Broo
