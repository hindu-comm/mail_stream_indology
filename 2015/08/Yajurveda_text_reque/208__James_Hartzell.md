Dear all,

I would be most grateful if some colleagues on the list might be able to
send me pdfs and/or digitized version links of the following:

1. Vishwabandhu's Grammatical index of the Yajurveda
2. A padapAtha of the YV Madhyandina Samhita (e.g. in the edition with
Sayana's commentary or in Satawalekar's edition).

Cheers,
