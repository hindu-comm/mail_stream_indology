>distinguished by the order in which their four hands display the discus,

mentions

 Padma Samhita (Jnana kanda: 2, 26- 28)

as the source for Chaturvimshati murti.

The blogger gives a very detailed analysis of the topic.

interestingly there is a table connecting the 24 upavyuhas to 24 letters of
the Gayatri Mantra.
