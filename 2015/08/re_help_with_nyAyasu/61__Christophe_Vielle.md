I would be interested by a reference (which one is given by Kuddala?) to an edition of the Parāśara-Upapurāṇa.
The Parāśara-(Upa)purāṇa, Parāśara-prokta / Parāśarokta / Pārāśar(y)a  (Upapurāṇa) occurs in several lists of upapurāṇa (see R. C. Hazra Studies in the Upapurāṇas vol. 1, 1958, pp. 4-12), but Hazra, who should have deal with it in the 3rd unpublished vol. of his "Studies" (the one on the śaiva upap.), does not give any reference nor comment on it, except the following footnote in vol. 1 p. 5 : "Thus the Parāśara-upapurāṇa seems to be distinguished from the Viṣṇu-p. or the spurious 'Vaiṣṇava' (mentioned by Vallālasena in his Dānasāgara, p. 7, verse 63), which was spoken out by Parāśara".
Through the EPB on-line (slip below), I see that a critical edition of the text was prepared but I don't think it was achieved.


Author	Gangadharan, N[ates]	 
Title	A brief note on the Parāśarapurāṇa	 
Language	Engl.	 
Published	In: Purāṇa 25,1, January 1983, p. 44-47	 
Description	Concise remarks on contents, extent, Śivaite character, and upapurāṇa nature of the Parāśarapurāṇa. Announces "a critical edition and analysis" of the text. The new Catalogus catalogorum seems to account for about fifty manuscripts of this Purāṇa. (F)

Now I see through WorldCat that there is at least this edition by Kapiladeva Tripāṭhī: Pārāśaropapurāṇam (samīkṣātmakaṃ sampādanam), Vārāṇasī : Sampūrṇānanda Saṃskṛta Viśvavidyālaya, 1990. Sarasvatībhavana-adhyayanamālā, 40.

>      In his Sanskrit introduction to the first volume of the Nirnayasagara edition of Patañjali's Vyākaraṇa-Mahābhāṣya (1917, p. 16, fn 5), the editor Shivadatta Kuddala says that this verse is from Parāśara-Upapurāṇa.  The same source is given for the traditional definitions of Sūtra and Vārttika. (Kuddāla, Intro, p. 12 and 14).  For the definition of Sūtra, Kuddāla also refers to Viṣṇūdharmottara (ibid, p. 12).  On p. 11 of his Introduction, Kuddāla quotes the following verse from Parāśara-Upapurāṇa:
>      pāṇinīyaṃ mahāśāstraṃ padasādhutvalakṣaṇam /
>      sarvopakārakaṃ grāhyaṃ kṛtsnaṃ tyājyaṃ na kiṃcana //
> From this it appears that there is a section in the Parāśara-Upapurāṇa dealing with Pāṇini, and the definitions of Sūtra, Vārttika and Bhāṣya likely appear in that section.

>   I don't have a copy of Parāśara-Upapurāṇa with me at hand, but that is one possible source to check. Hope this helps.  Best,
