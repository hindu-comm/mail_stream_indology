     The source of Kuddāla for his statements in his Intro to Patañjali's
Mahabhāṣya must be statements found in Vaidyanātha Pāyaguṇḍe's commentary
Chāya on Nāgeśa's Uddyota.  All these quotes are found in the introductory
verses of Chāya (Vol 1, Vyākaraṇa-Mahābhāṣya, ed. Shivadatta Kaddala,
Nirnayasagara, 1917, p2), where Vaidyanātha refers to ParāśaraPurāṇa, and
Viṣṇudharmottara.
     I found an edition of Parāśara-Upapurāṇa on the website of MAHARISHI
UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT VEDIC LITERATURE COLLECTION.  I have attached the
pdf here.  All the passages cited by Kuddāla and Vaidyanātha's Chāyā are
found in this edition.  I am giving detailed references below:

pāṇinīyaṃ mahāśāstraṃ padasādhutvalakṣaṇam /ad viśvatomukham
sarvopakārakaṃ grāhyam kṛtsnaṃ tyājyaṃ na kiñcana //
Verse 29, Adhyāya 8, p. 22

alpākṣaramasandigdhaṃ sāravad viśvatomukham /
astobham anavadyaṃ ca sūtraṃ sūtravido viduḥ //
Verse 13cd 14ab, Adhyāya 18, p. 63

sūtrārtho varṇyate yatra vākyaiḥ sūtrānukāribhiḥ /
svapadāni ca varṇyante bhāṣyam bhāṣyavido viduḥ //
Verse 15cd 16ab, Adhyāya 18, p. 63

uktānuktaduruktānāṃ cintā yatra pravartate /
taṃ granthaṃ vārttikaṃ prāhur vārttikajñā manīṣiṇaḥ //
Verse 19cd 20ab, Adhyāya 18, p. 63
