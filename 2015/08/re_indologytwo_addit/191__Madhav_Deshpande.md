Hello David and Nancy,

My colleague at the University of Michigan, Professor Benjamin Fortson, a
few months ago gave a talk about some peculiarities of the Āśvalāyana
Saṃhitā of the RV.  I was unable to attend the talk due to being ill at
that time.  I have requested him to send me a pdf or a ppt of his talk.  I
would be most interested in hearing more about these alternative recensions
of the RV and their distinctive features, if any.  Best,

Madhav Deshpande
