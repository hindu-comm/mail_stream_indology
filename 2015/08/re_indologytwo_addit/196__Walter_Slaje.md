> the khilas (...) are apocrypha only for the Śākala recension.

This insight is not new. Isidor Scheftelowitz has emphasized this fact
already in 1906 (pp. 11ff) in his introduction to his edition of the
Ṛgvedakhilāni which he established from a unique birch-bark Śāradā
manuscript:

Isidor Scheftelowitz, Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda. [Indische Forschungen.
Heft 1.] Breslau 1906. [Reprint Hildesheim 1966].

The variant readings of the Saṃhitā text from this manuscript - misjudged
by M. Müller and therefore not reported in Müller's and Aufrecht's
respective editions - were published in 1907 together with a series of valuable
observations regarding phonological and orthographical peculiarities of the
textual transmission of the RV:

Isidor Scheftelowitz, Zur Textkritik und Lautlehre des Ṛgveda. WZKM 21
(1907): 85-142.
