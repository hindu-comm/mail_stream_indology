Hello Madhav and Dean,

I'll be also interested by anything you can get on this subject.

I would be most interested in hearing more about these alternative recensions of the RV and their distinctive features, if any.  Best,

In particular, I was earlier informed that an 1897 book in Danish by Hans Vodskov, Rig-veda og Edda, has a chapter attempting to demonstrate that the Ṛgveda we have shows a very late style. My informant noted that Vodskov's views about the late style of the Śākala recension have not been adopted by Vedic scholars. Now that we have two additional recensions, almost identical to the Śākala recension, I assume that this would be significant evidence for an early, unchanged style.

What we have is only one recension (saṃhitā) of the Ṛgveda compiled several centuries after the hymns were composed by the Ṛgvedic sages."
