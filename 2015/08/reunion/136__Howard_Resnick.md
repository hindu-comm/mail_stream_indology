In the Mahabharata’s 14th book, Ashramavasika-parva, chapters 32-33, Vyasa is able to summon all the warriors slain at Kurukshetra, who rise from the Bhagirathi and appear to Dhrtarastra, Gandhari, and all the other survivors and widows of the battle.

Do scholars consider this section to be “old”? Generally, what do they make of it? Any information on scholarly reaction to this amazing episode will be appreciated.

Thanks,
Howard
