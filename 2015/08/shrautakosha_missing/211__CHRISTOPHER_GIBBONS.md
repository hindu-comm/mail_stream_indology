Dear List Members, 

The text I have sourced of RN Dandekar et al. (1958-73) Śrautakośa: Encyclopaedia of Vedic Sacrificial Ritual (volume 1) is missing the section entitled ‘The duties of the hotṛ: the recitation of the sāmidhenī verses and allied rites’ at pp. 337-352. 

I would be very grateful if someone could provide me with a scan of the missing section.

Thank you in advance, 

Chris Gibbons
