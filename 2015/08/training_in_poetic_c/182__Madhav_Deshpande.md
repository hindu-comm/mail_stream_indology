While many Sanskritists from Pune have been writing in Sanskrit (prose and
poetry), some of the more noteworthy writers are (Late) K. S. Arjunwadkar
(poetry: Kaṇṭakāñjali), (Late) G.B. Palsule (many Sanskrit dramas,
translations from Marathi, and the epic poem Vīravaināyakam on the life of
Savarkar), (late) P.S. Joshi (Bhīmāyanam, epic poem on the life of
Ambedkar), (late) S.D. Joshi (Sanskrit translation of Hamlet).
