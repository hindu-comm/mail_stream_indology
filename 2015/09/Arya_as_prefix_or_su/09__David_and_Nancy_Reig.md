Martin, if your compounded list of names is in a Buddhist text, then it is
almost certain that *ārya* is a prefix, as in Āryāvalokiteśvara. In many
Mahāyāna Buddhist texts *ārya* has a more specific meaning than just an
honorific. It means that one has reached the third of the five paths, the
path of seeing (*darśana-mārga*), when for the first time ones sees reality
directly. From that point on, one is an *ārya*, and the title *ārya* is
often prefixed to one's name. Thus, Ārya Nāgārjuna, Āryāsaṅga, etc.
