Many thanks to Artur Karp, David Reigle, Ashok Aklujkar and Nagaraj 
Paturi for their input on this topic. It seems my original impression -- 
that /ƒÅrya /is more common as a suffix in the south, and as a prefix in 
Buddhist contexts -- is somewhat justified, but that there are no 
clear-cut rules.
