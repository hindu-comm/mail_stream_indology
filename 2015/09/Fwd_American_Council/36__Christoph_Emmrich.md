American Council for Southern Asian Art
(ACSAA) Symposium XVII

The American Council for Southern Asian Art (ACSAA) will hold its 17th biennial meeting at the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada, on October 15-17th, 2015.

ACSAA symposia occur in alternating years, and serve as opportunities to meet colleagues, reconnect with mentors and graduate school cohorts, and share one's current research with the field. From senior scholars to graduate students, ACSAA symposia are one of the primary ways ACSAA members gather and support one another, share ideas with a group of like-minded colleagues, and participate in the ACSAA community.
