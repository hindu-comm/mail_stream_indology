Thanks, Matthew and Nagaraj. The present tense verb "is" in the sentence,
"However, this great Indian tradition is on the wane due to some selfish,
reprobate and untruthful preceptors," does make it sound like the reference
could be to contemporary preceptors. If, however, the Sanskrit announcement
letter is the original one and the English letter is only its translation,
then we do indeed have the past tense verb āsīt, "was," in this sentence.
In that case, and without further clarification from the Rāṣṭriya-Saṃskṛ
ta-Saṃsthānam, we would have to assume that they mean by "some selfish,
reprobate and untruthful preceptors" those such as the Buddha, whose
followers Śaṅkarācārya is depicted as defeating.

Best regards,
