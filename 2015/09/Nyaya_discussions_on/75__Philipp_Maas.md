For a definition of the term *dṛṣṭānta *see, for example, Carakasamhita
Vimanasthana 8.34 (in the ed. of Trikamji):

atha dṛṣṭāntaḥ — dṛṣṭānto nāma yatra mūrkhaviduṣāṃ buddhisāmyaṃ, yo varṇyaṃ
varṇayati. yathā — agnir uṣṇaḥ, dravam udakaṃ, sthirā pṛthivī, ādityaḥ
prakāśaka iti; yathādityaḥ prakāśakas tathā sāṅkhyajñānaṃ prakāśakam iti.

Oberhammer's (Unter Mitarb. von Ernst Prets und Joachim Prandstetter)
Begriffswörterbuch, vol. 2, which I do not have at my desk, should provide
additional references s.v. *dṛṣṭānta.*

With kind regards,

Philipp
