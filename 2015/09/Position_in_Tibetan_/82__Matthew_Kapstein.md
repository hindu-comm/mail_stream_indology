Dear Eli,

Thank you for this information and congratulations on saving this post. Could you please
clarify what you mean by "in general professors 
at the University of Leipzig who are not native speakers of German are 
required to teach in English within two years of their appointment"?

I assume that you mean that they can teach in English for the first two years
but must then switch over to German. Is this correct?

thanks and best regards,
Matthew
