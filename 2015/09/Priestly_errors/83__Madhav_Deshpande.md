Dear Colleagues,

Yesterday, my wife and I attended a Hindu wedding near Detroit.  The
wedding on the whole went fine.  However, the priest, while having the
bride and the groom take the oath of commitments, did two things.  In
addition to "dharme ca arthe ca kāme ca", he added "mokṣe ca".  This was
something I have not heard before.  But more shocking was the fact that he
inadvertently dropped "na" from the phrase "na aticarāmi".  Evidently, the
priest did not realize this in the flow of his performance, and no one else
attending the wedding, besides me, noticed this either.  Clearly, dropping
the "na" in "na aticarāmi" was an error.  But is the addition of "mokṣe ca"
to "dharme ca arthe ca kāme ca" found in some regions of India?
