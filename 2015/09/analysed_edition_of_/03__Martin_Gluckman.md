Greetings,

I am looking for an edition (digital or otherwise) of the entire á¹šg Veda
which has been parsed (syntactic, semantic and morphological). In case
anyone is aware of any such edition or part thereof I would much appreciate
further information therewith.

With Kindest Wishes,

Martin Gluckman
