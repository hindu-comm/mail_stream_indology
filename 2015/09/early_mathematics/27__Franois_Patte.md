I published some times ago an edition and translation into French of a
commentary on Bhāskara's Līlāvatī where all these elementary
operations are explained. If you are interested I could help. If you
do not read French language, at least you can read the Sanskrit text...

On these subjects: interest, mixture and so on, I have not finished
yet the edition/translation, but you can find some parts here:

Hope this help.
