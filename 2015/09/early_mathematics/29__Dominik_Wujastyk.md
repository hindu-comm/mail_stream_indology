For primary sources, I've always thought
Rangācārya, M. (Ed.) *The Gaṇita-sāra-sangraha of Mahāvīrācārya with
English Translation and Notes* Madras Govt. Press, 1912,
to be a brilliantly clear exposition of medieval Indian mathematics.

For a general introduction and orientation, with up-to-date notes and
bibliography for further reading, we now have
Plofker, K. *Mathematics in India* Princeton University Press, 2009.
