Dear list,

I am trying to identify a work mentioned by Harikṛṣṇa in the 
Krīḍākauśalya section of his Bṛhajjyotiṣārṇava from 1871 CE. Discussing 
his Snakes & Ladders-like Karmapaṭṭa game, he lists the following 
sources for it:

dṛṣṭvā karmavipākārkaṃ purāṇaṃ gāruḍaṃ tathā /
śātātapasmṛtiṃ mātsyaṃ śrīmadbhāgavatādikam // 6.20.254

Now, the work I am interested in identifying is the Karmavipākārka. 
While there are, of course, numerous works on karmavipāka, the only work 
given by NCC carrying the exact title Karmavipākārka (though also simply 
known as Karmavipāka) is a work attributed to Śaṅkarabhaṭṭa, son of 
Nīlakaṇṭha.

Could anyone with a better overview of karmavipāka texts than myself 
tell me if this might be the work referred to by Harikṛṣṇa?

Any suggestions are most welcome, including references to secondary 
literature on karmavipāka and karmavipāka texts.

Kind regards,
Jacob
