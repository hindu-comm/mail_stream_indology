To Sanskrit Readers,

This issue, number 11, is a report on the WSC in Bangkok 2015 which  
Professor Hari Dutt Sharma kindly prepared in Sanskrit.

Members of the IASS have already seen it. Apologies for multiple cross  
postings.

Hopefully it will interest those seeing it for the first time.

RISA-L might not accept the attachment. In this case please see it in  
the IASS website where it will be uploaded shortly. You will also find  
the other 10 issues there as well:

With best wishes,
Jay Soni
