There seems to be a tense-related mistake in the first line of the
paragraph. In fact there are many other such problems with the English in
the announcement. It may make sense if it is corrected as follows:

"However, this great Indian tradition* was *on the wane due to some selfish,
reprobate and untruthful preceptors. This situation  provided a perfect
launch pad for the divine manifested disciple of Sree Govinda Bhagavatpada,
the peerless seer, Srimad Adi Sankaracharya, who restored the sanctity
of this great Indian tradition through his teachings of Advaita Philosophy
â€“ Monism or Non-Dualism to bring out the real radiance of Truth of Atman "
