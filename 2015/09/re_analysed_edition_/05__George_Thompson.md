Dear Martin [and James],

Well, of course there is the padapatha analysis of the samhita text and
there is Sayana's commentary.  But if you are looking for a contemporary
scholarly edition of the RV which parses everything, I don't think that
such a thing exists.

However, in conjunction with their recent translation of the entire RV,
Brereton and Jamison have initiated a website where they intend to comment
in more detail on their translation.  They have invited other Rg Veda
specialists to add comments as well. This may eventually evolve into
something like what you are looking for, but surely it will take many years.

The website is:

http://rigvedacommentary.alc.ucla.edu/

The website does not allow for open commentary, however.  The authors
prefer to confine discussion for now to their RV colleagues.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
