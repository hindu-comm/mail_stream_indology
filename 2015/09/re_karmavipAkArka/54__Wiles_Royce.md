Hi

Velankar in the Jinaratnakośa (reference below) lists manuscripts of four separate works entitled Karmavipāka (p. 72-73) (nothing listed matches Karmavipākārkam) unfortunately.

I have no idea if these are relevant to your question but you make like to explore more:

(1) Karmavipāka of Gargarṣi ((7 commentaries extant), published Bhavnagar in samvat 1972 (JAS series; no 52) 
(2) K. of Devendrasūri (2 commentaries extant)
(3) K. of Śubhaśīla Gaṇi (1 manuscript known)
(4) K. of Mallidāsa (2 manuscripts known)

Velankar, H.D., 1944, Jinaratnakośa: an alphabetical register of Jain works and authors (vol. 1 works (no more published)), Bhankarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona.
