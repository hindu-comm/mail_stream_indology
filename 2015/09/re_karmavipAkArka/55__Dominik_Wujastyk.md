The large *VṛddhaSūryĀrunaKarmavipāka*, that is quite well known in the
literature, casts Sūrya as one of the main interlocutors.  I don't know if
that somehow explains the -arka.  Probably not, but I thought I'd mention
it.

The VSAK was published by Khemarāja Śrīkṛṣṇadāsa in Mumbai in 1909; the
edition and also a fine manuscript of the work are both available in the
Wellcome Library in London.
