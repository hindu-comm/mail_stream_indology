Dear list,

I am trying to track down a copy of the following article:

Wakankar, S.Y. (1986) "A Survey of Sanskrit Works on the Game of Chess" 
in Journal of the Oriental Institute (Baroda), no. 35.

I have tried in all the usual places to no avail, and even the author 
himself is despairing of a copy. Any help would be much appreciated.

Regards,
Jacob
