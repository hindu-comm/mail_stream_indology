John Smith's Win keyboard
<http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/IndUni_Win_keyboard.zip>
handler still works with Win 8.1 at least.  Probably 10 too, but I haven't
tried. It's for typing IAST
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration>,
with any suitably populated Unicode font, but of course also with his own
unicode fonts.  It's all here
<http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/index.html>.  Also for
Mac.
