Before Rich reported Prof dr Nebes's opinion, I had asked my colleague
Ahmad Al-Jallad, an expert in Arabian epigraphy, and he in turn asked a
specialist, Dr. Alessia Prioletta, University of Pisa, from whom he
received the following (since it does provide some additional information,
I append it here although the main point has already been clarified):

I’ve never seen this text before, even though to be 100% sure I should
check a few old publications, which I don’t have with me right now.
The text is a fragment of dedication to Tʾlb Rymm master of Qdmn ḏ-Dmhn
(ll. 3-4). From the name of the sanctuary, it comes from the city of
al-Ḥuqqa north of Sanaa. It is not possible to determine the length of the
lacuna on the top and the bottom of the text, whereas on the right only few
letters should be missing (about two). The text should date around the end
of 1st c. BC to 2nd c. AD. Finally, it is interesting because only a few
bronze plaques have been found with dedication to Ta’lab, and none to Tʾlb
of Qdmn ḏ-Dmhn.

Al-Jallad adds that since it seems to have been unpublished, the chances
that it are fake are very small --i.e., it is not likely to be a copy of a
known object.

Best, Jonathan
