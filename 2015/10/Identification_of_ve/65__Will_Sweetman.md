Dear all

I'd be grateful for any assistance in identifying the source of this 
verse, transliterated from some sort of devanagari

sarva dṛṣta sarva śrōta
sarva kretā ca rakṣakaḥ
sarva jñaḥ sarva rūpī ca
sarvam ca sarvataḥ pitā

The character given here as ca is unrecognisable to me, but from the 
Roman and Telugu transliteration, I'm fairly sure that is what's intended.

This is taken from a letter of an early eighteenth-century Jesuit 
missionary to a Telugu-speaking region who (like me) confessed that he'd 
forgotten all the Sanskrit he'd learned, so the errors here may be his 
or mine.

Best wishes

Will
