/Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntabhūṣaṇa/, also known as /Vaiyākaraṇabhūṣaṇa,/ is an 
authentic text in Pāṇiniansemantics. It is a commentary on the 
/Vaiyākaraṇamatonmajjana/ compiled by the great grammarian Bhaṭṭoji 
Dīkṣita (17^th c.),and is written by Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa, the nephew of 
Bhaṭṭoji. The main intention is to refute the objections raised by 
Naiyāyikas and Mīmāṃsakason various aspects of Pāṇiniansemantics and to 
establish the grammarians’ views on the subject. 
/Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntabhūṣaṇasāra/, an abridged version of the 
/Vaiyākaraṇabhūṣaṇa/, also written by Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa, is the more famous 
text with more than ten commentaries written on it. But nobody has so 
far attempted to write a commentary on the /Vaiyākaraṇabhūṣaṇa/ and 
though the text has been published four times from different places, 
none of them can be treated as a critical edition.

The /Vaiyākaraṇabhūṣaṇa /is being published here with the /Nirañjanī 
/commentary by Pandit Ramyatna Shukla, and critical notes (/Prakāśa/) by 
the editor. The edition itself is prepared taking a 17^th c. manuscript 
as base, and comparing it with 40 other manuscripts from different parts 
of India, and with printed versions. The present volume contains the 
first part of the work and is devoted to the meaning of roots and verbal 
suffixes which is at its heart.

*Keywords:*Grammar, Sanskrit, Paninian semantics, commentary
