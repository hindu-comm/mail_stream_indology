Dear Colleagues,
Attached is a photograph of a copper plate found near Peshawar. Exact location of the fund is unknown. I thought this might be of some interested to some of you. If anyone can say more about the contents of the copper plate and its possible date, itâ€™ll be appreciated. 
Regards,
Piotr Balcerowicz
