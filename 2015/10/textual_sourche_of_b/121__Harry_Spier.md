Dear list members,


Can any of the list members give me the textual source  for where the
bhūsūktam comes from?


I've seen an internet  reference to mahānārāyaṇopaniṣad (28) but I haven't
been able to find the bhūsūktam in the mahānārāyaṇopaniṣad.


The first few verses are from the Taittiriya Samhita 1.5.3 but I'm looking
from where the bhūsūktam as a whole occurs because  I'm looking for the
scriptural source of the Gayatri mantra:

dhanurdharāyai vidmahe

sarvasiddhyai ca dhīmahi

tanno dharā pracodayāt



which is part of the  bhūsūktam .


I've searched the on-line resources (Bloomfields Concordance, GRETIL and
Muktabodha) and haven't found it.


Thanks,

Harry Spier
