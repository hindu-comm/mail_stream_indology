Balabhadra in his astrological work /Hāyanaratna/ repeatedly makes use 
of the noun /viśeṣa/ in a sense which seems from the context to mean 
something like 'special rule' or 'particular consideration'. I haven't 
found this precise meaning in any dictionary and am curious to know if 
the term occurs with this technical meaning in any other śāstras.
