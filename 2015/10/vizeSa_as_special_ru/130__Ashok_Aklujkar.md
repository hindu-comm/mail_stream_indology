Could you cite a few occurrences with at least the whole sentence as a context? If the form is as one sees in vṛkṣa-viśeṣa, niyama-viśeṣa (or vṛkṣāṇāṁ viśeṣaḥ, niyamānāṁ viśeṣaḥ etc., then viśeṣa has not been used in any unusual sense.

I haven't found this precise meaning in any dictionary and am curious to know if the term occurs with this technical meaning in any other śāstras.
