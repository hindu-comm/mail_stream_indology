Two later features may be noted

In the daily prayers the Gāyatrī is muttered as it is in the Ṛgveda. The
citation betrays sectarian need.

Many cults developed later. But modified use of the Gāyatrī did not take
place widely so that any generalization may be misleading. The Ṛgvedic
Gāyatrī is overwhelmingly more in use.
