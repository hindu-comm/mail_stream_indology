Dear colleagues,

I am very pleased to announce the launch of the updated AyurYog project
website and blog at ayuryog.org !

The AyurYog project "Medicine, Immortality, Mokṣa: Entangled Histories of
Ayurveda, Yoga and Alchemy in South Asia" examines the connections between
ayurveda, yoga and rasaśāstra with a focus on health, rejuvenation and
longevity practices.

The ERC-Starting-Grant-funded research project is hosted at the Institute
for South Asian, Tibetan and Buddhist Studies at the University of Vienna.

I hope you enjoy the website and the blog!

With best wishes,

Dagmar Wujastyk
