Dear Patrick,

Historically, long compounds seem to have begun with dvandvas. The relationship of the constituents is uniform and easiest to understand in a dvandva. There is no syntactic complexity. Essentially all one does is to list. In the Artha-śāstra, too, almost all long compounds are dvandvas. In verse texts like the Yājñavalkya Smṛti the only additional constraint is to rearrange the items in such a way as to fit the expected sequence of heavy and light syllables. In the śloka or anuṣṭubh metre such rearranging is not very difficult to achieve. 

Best.

ashok

I find 9.5% (192 total) of half-verses in YDh following this pattern.
