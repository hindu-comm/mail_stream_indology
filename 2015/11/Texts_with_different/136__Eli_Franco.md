VAcaspatimizra and Abhinavagupta would be obvious choices.

Zitat von hellwig7 at gmx.de:

> Dear list members,
>
> I am looking for Sanskrit authors who have written about many (>=3)  
> different topics or in many (>=3) different genres (e.g., poetry,  
> narrative, philosophical, scientific, ...); alternatively for  
> voluminous texts by one author that cover such different topics in  
> separate chapters (i.e., the thematic strata should be easily  
> separable).
>
> Further requirements:
> 1) Authorship of their works should be consolidated in Indological research.
> 2) Texts should not be too short.
> 3) Texts should not be collections of former works or of citations  
> only, but "really" be written by these authors.
> 4) The older, the better!
> 5) Texts should be edited or - even better - already digitized.
>
> The first (and actually only) author that came to my mind is  
> Kshemendra. Do you have any other ideas? Any feedback is highly  
> appreciated.

> Regards, Oliver
