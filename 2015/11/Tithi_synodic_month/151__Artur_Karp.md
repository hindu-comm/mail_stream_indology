Dear Colleagues,

Is there any evidence for the use of the fraction 63/64  – to determine the
length of the lunar day (tithi)? In ancient Babylonian-Greek astronomy? In
ancient Indian astronomy?


The result of the division, if multiplied by 30, would give the length of
the synodic month  – as 29. 53125d.



Your help in the matter would be greatly appreciated,


Artur Karp
