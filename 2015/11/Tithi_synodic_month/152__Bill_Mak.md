Dear Artur,

Sphujidhvaja in Yavanajātaka 79.5 gives the definition of a tithi as 63/64 of a civil day:

dinaṃ catuḥṣaṣṭilavonam āhus tithiṃ dyuśabdākhyam ahas tu sarvam |

triṣaṣṭibhāgena yutaṃ sahasraṃ yuge ’vamānām apasaptaṣaṭkam ||5||

They say that a day (dinam) minus 1/64 [of a day] is a tithi; on the other hand, a day (ahar), called by the word dyu, is one whole [tithi] plus 1/63 [of a tithi]. The number of omitted tithis (avama) in a yuga is equal to 1000 minus "7 times 6" (i.e. 1000 - 42 = 958).

Pingree's translation is somewhat different and but I believe his maths is incorrect since t = 1- 1/64 d, d = t + 1/63. His reading of cd was based on his own emendation and not on the ms (or even his own reading in the apparatus!):

They say that a tithi equals a day minus 1/64th, but that every day equals a tithi plus 1/60th. In a yuga there are 990 seasons (ṛtu), (each) consisting of 62 (tithis).

63/64 is used only as an approximate value, since the algorithm for the "caturmānavidhāna" (79.6 ff.) yields the value 60272/61230 which would give a better synodic month of 29.5306222... (given also in 79.12) compared to 29.53125 (cmp. modern value: 29.53059...).

Hayashi Takao pointed out to me that the expression for 64/63 can be easily derived from 61230/60272 through a popular method of approximation by reducing a series of fraction. I would be interested in other instances of 64/63, 1/64 or 1/63. If you know any, please let me know.

For further explanations and notes, see my critical edition:

Best regards,

Bill
