Greetings to all, namaskaromi --

Perhaps you know of secondary literature concerning the use of so-called
paribhāṣās, or interpretive rules by any name, in dharmaśāstra
particularly. Of course P. V. Kane has laid the ground in Chapter XXX of
History of Dharmaśāstra, volume 5.

I am also interested in explicit mentions of the word 'paribhāṣā' in works
of dharmaśāstra. I've already unearthed a few by searching the texts on
GRETIL.

I would be honored and delighted to receive your advice and suggestions.

All the best,
Jo
