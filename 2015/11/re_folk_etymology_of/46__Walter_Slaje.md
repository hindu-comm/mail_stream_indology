This since Bühler's detailed analysis of the Nīlamata in his famous Kashmīr
report of 1877 well-known desiccation myth simply provided a background for
"Nirvacananists" in search for a meaning like "water-draining-away" in the
syllables *ka-śmī-ra*. The Nīlamata reference with *ka *(n.) as "water" may
tacitly presuppose on what Govind Kaul elaborated more extensively later in
the 19th century. See his *Rājataraṅgiṇīpradeśavyākhyā *(MS Stein No. 128,
Clauson's Catalogue [1912] p. 598). There, he explains the nirukti in the
context of Kashmir's "second name", Satīsaras, in the following manner: *kaṃ
*[=] jalaṃ, *śmīrati *[=] calaty asmād iti *śmīra smīra* calane iti dhātor
auṇādikaṃ rūpam. Thereafter he quotes your  Nīlamata passage, incidentally
using the notable variant *halinā *instead of *hariṇā* (cp. the apparatus
in De Vreese's ed.).
Thus by a forced uṇādi derivation two nominal stems *śmīra / smīra* were
made up assigning to it the meaning of the verbal root *cal*. This could
very well represent an older tradition. Anyway, following Kaul's etymology,
*ka-śmīra* would eventually come to mean "[land]
from-where-the-water-drained-away".
In this manuscript, Govind Kaul explains also the etymologies of the name
Kashmir in the Kaśmīrī (*kaśīra, kaśur, kaśūr*) and Persian (*kaśyapamar,
kaśmar*) languages.
