It looks like the Gītā Supersite, http://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/, has the commentary of Madhusudan Saraswati [sic], as well as several of those in the volume mentioned by Dan Lusthaus.  

The site also appears to have resolved some of the font display issues that plagued it in the past.

Could someone please point me to an electronic version of Madhusūdana’s commentary on the Gītā?
Thank you.
