Another area to think about is the "Tantra-yukti" lists that occur in the
Arthaśāstra, Carakasaṃhitā and Suśrutasaṃhitā.  There's a good account of
them in Antonella Comba's *La medicina indiana classica*
<http://www.lulu.com/shop/antonella-serena-comba/la-medicina-indiana-classica-%C4%81yurveda/paperback/product-18654023.html>
and in Dasgupta's *History of Indian Philosophy*
<https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfIndianPhilosophyBySurendranathDasgupta-5Volumes>
v.2 ch.13.  These are like general paribhāṣās that appear to be very old
and were applied in several śāstras, including especially nyāya.
