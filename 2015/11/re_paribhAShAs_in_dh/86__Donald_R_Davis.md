Dear Jo,

There is an interesting Dharmaśāstra use of paribhāṣā in connection with the vivādapada called saṃvidvyatikrama.  Several commentaries call the conventions of various local groups pāribhāṣikadharma and speak of settling complicated legal matters by resorting to this kind of dharma.  I understand these to be local rules that fix the manner in which rules of śāstra will be applied or received in particular groups, and thence paribhāṣās.  I wrote about this some time ago in JESHO 2005 (I’ll send you the article separately).

Other, more familiar uses of paribhāṣā also occur when an author defines terms.  For example, at Mitākṣarā (Ydh) 1.366, Vijñāneśvara says the verse is a paribhāṣā of the author’s own treatise, defining the meaning of highest, middle, and lowest fines.  The term occurs several other times in the Mitākṣarā.

Hope that gives you some more to go on.

Best, Don

Subject: [INDOLOGY] paribhāṣās in dharmaśāstra?

Greetings to all, namaskaromi --

Perhaps you know of secondary literature concerning the use of so-called paribhāṣās, or interpretive rules by any name, in dharmaśāstra particularly. Of course P. V. Kane has laid the ground in Chapter XXX of History of Dharmaśāstra, volume 5.

I am also interested in explicit mentions of the word 'paribhāṣā' in works of dharmaśāstra. I've already unearthed a few by searching the texts on GRETIL.

I would be honored and delighted to receive your advice and suggestions.

All the best,
Jo
