Further on Prof. Bhattacharya’s excellent suggestion of Chakrabarti’s articles collected in his 1980 book, The Paribhāṣās in the Śrautasūtras (Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar):
More recently, I notice, he has published Apastamba-Samanya-Sutra or Yajnaparibhasa Sutra (Asiatic Society of Calcutta, 2006), including text, translation, and analysis, which I have not yet seen (just ordered a copy).

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] paribhāṣās in dharmaśāstra?

Samiran Chandra Chakrabarti's work on the Paribhshas of the Srautasutras came out around 1988 in the form of papers published in the JRAS. Later a book was published from Calcutta.

Greetings to all, namaskaromi --

Perhaps you know of secondary literature concerning the use of so-called paribhāṣās, or interpretive rules by any name, in dharmaśāstra particularly. Of course P. V. Kane has laid the ground in Chapter XXX of History of Dharmaśāstra, volume 5.

I am also interested in explicit mentions of the word 'paribhāṣā' in works of dharmaśāstra. I've already unearthed a few by searching the texts on GRETIL.

I would be honored and delighted to receive your advice and suggestions.

All the best,
Jo
