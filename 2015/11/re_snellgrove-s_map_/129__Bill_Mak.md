Many thanks to the prompt response and helpful tips from Will and Artur. We managed to find Chuṣyā Bahāl not far from Thamel and the priest there kindly gave us many useful information about the temple and the wood-carvings, including those of the saptavāra and 27 nakṣatras. Those who are interested in some of the pictures we have taken may check out these links:
