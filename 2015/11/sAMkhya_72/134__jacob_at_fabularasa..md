Dear list,

I am trying to determine the possible rationale behind expressing 
sāṃkhya-based philosophical tenets on 72-square (8x9) jñāna caupaṛa 
(snakes and ladders) boards. I have noticed that the Sāṃkhyakārikā as 
well as the expositions on sāṃkhya in the Bhagavadgītā (chapter 2) and 
the Bhāgavatapurāṇa (3.26) all consist of 72 verses. I have considered 
the explanation that 24 tattvas times 3 guṇas equals 72, but I would be 
curious to know if you are aware of any other explanations linking 
sāṃkhya and its exposition with the number 72.

Regards,
Jacob
