Dear List,

Might anyone have a scan of Duncan J. Derrett's 'Development of the Concept
of Property in India c. A.D. 800-1800'?

This is found both in *Zeitschrift für Vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft*,
vol. 64, pp. 15-130 and *Essays in Classical and Modern Hindu Law*, v. II.

I don't have access to either volumes here and ILL can only secure vol
1 of *Essays
in Classical and Modern Hindu Law*.


Many thanks,
Samuel Wright

Nalanda University
