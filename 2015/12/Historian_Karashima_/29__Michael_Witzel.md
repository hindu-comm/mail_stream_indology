Since nobody has commented so far, I send the sad news that my old friend Noboru Karashima, the great specialist of Tamil Nadu and South Indian history, has passed away in late November.   

You can find an early obituary in THE HINDU at: <http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-scholar-who-inspired-a-generation/article7920303.ece>
and cf. the short WIKI at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noboru_Karashima#cite_note-11>

Another great Indologist has left usâ€¦
