Dear All,

This is basically just to confirm the information that Christophe Vielle 
has already given.  This is clearly the Rāmakathā section of the Vahni 
Purāṇā, on which Anasuya Bhaumik has been working for some time. I add 
next some notes from the first volume of her edn of the Purāṇa and from 
her as yet unpublished paper delivered at DICSEP 5 (2008),“Rāma episode 
in an unpublished Purāṇa manuscript”:

4 mss of /Vahni Purāṇa/ used by Bhowmik in edn: 2 in India Office (one 
dated 1589 A.D., the other 1804 [saṃvat 1861]), a third in Calcutta (one 
in Asiatic Society, undated?), which lacks the Rāmakathā in second part 
(found in both I.O. mss), and a fourth in Sanskit Parishad (? - *check*).

Bhowmik notes (/Vahnipurāṇa/ 2012: cxxiv) that there are references to 
the /VR/ in the main text, at 36.73 (to be read regularly, as it dispels 
and demolishes all sins) and at 61.43.“From above quotations, it can be 
concluded that Rāmakathā is not an interpolation but was included in the 
second phase of its transformation.The Rāmakathā is also getting 
published from The Asiatic Society, Kolkata in near further.” [sic]

Yours
