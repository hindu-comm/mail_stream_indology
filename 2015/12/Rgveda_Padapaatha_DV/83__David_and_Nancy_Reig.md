Dear Harry,

The padapāṭhas are included in these two recensions of the Ṛgveda that have
only recently become available in printed editions:

Āśvalāyana-Saṃhitā of the Ṛgveda, edited by B. B. Chaubey, 2 volumes., New
Delhi: Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, 2009.

The Ṛgveda Saṃhitā of Śāṃkhāyana-Śākhā, edited by Amal Dhari Singh Gautam,
4 volumes., Ujjain: Maharshi Sandipani Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishthan,
2012-2013.

When the description of the new DVD referred to "four versions of Pada
Paatha texts available at the time of its preparation," it added: "It has
been observed that these texts have large number of errors – both printing
as well as substantial."

So my question also pertains to whether these errors are in the various
long available printed editions of the Ṛgveda in the Śākala śākhā that
include the padapāṭha, or whether these errors are in the more recent
printed editions of the Ṛgveda in the Āśvalāyana śākhā and in the Śāṃkhāyana
śākhā that include the padapāṭha.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
