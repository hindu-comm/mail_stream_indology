Dear Harry,
Two editions have been done, but neither is widely available:
1. Kākacaṇḍīśvarakalpatantra, ed. R. Sharma. Kashi Sanskrit Series 73. Benares. 1929.
2. Kākacaṇḍīśvarakalpatantra : text with English translationAuthor:	Kākacaṇḍīśvara.; Gyanendra Pandey, (Medical scientist)Publisher: Varanasi : Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 2003.Series: Chowkhamba Sanskrit studies, v. 121.
Jan Meulenbeld's History of Indian Medical Literature (2A, pp. 608-12) indicates that the Kākacaṇḍīśvarakalpatantra and Kākacaṇḍīśvaramata are two different works. The NCC (vol. 3) appears to conflate their manuscripts.
Best wishes,
Jason

Thank you for this Jason.  A quick look at the NGMCP on-line title list  shows 7 manuscripts of the kākacaṇḍeśvarīmata but no texts called  kākacaṇḍeśvarakalpatantra .Does Gordon White say anything about where the manuscript or manuscripts of a text called   kākacaṇḍeśvarakalpatantra are located.
