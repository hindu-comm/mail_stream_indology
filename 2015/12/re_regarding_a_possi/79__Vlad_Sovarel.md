Dear Dipak,
Thanks for your answer/opinion.I had to ask the community before considering it an avyutpannaśabda, taking also into consideration a non-OIA origin.
Yours,Vlad

 An OIAetymology, though always possible to invent, will be uncalled for according tome. It may better pass as an avyutpannaśabda.So also with the etymology of Cheranga/Chowrangi, name of sage associated withHaṭhayoga.

Subject:Regarding a possible etymology of the name Gheraṇḍa
Dear all,
My access to Indian languages is not so great (besides some Sanskrit & Bengali), so I couldn't figure out any etymology for the name of Gheraṇḍa (घेरण्ड).
Any suggestion will be much appreciated.
Many thanks and all the bestfrom Bucharest,
Vlad Șovărel
