Dear Jan,

Thank you very much for your reply and for the link to the conference
reports. I see what you mean about the adhyātman interpretation of indra.
The three additional verses that the Āśvalāyana-Saṃhitā of the Ṛgveda adds
to hymn 6.44 (= Ṛgveda khila 2.12.1-3) do indeed make this clear.

For those who may be following this, but who do not have access to the Āśval
āyana-Saṃhitā, I here paste in those three verses from the GRETIL digital
text of the Scheftelowitz edition of the khilani. I have put in brackets
two corrections from comparison with the Āśvalāyana text. Note also that
2,12.1c is not in the Āśvalāyana text.

RvKh_2,12.1a: cakṣuś.ca.śrotram.ca.manaś.ca.vāk.ca.pr
<http://xn--jga.ca.xn--rotram-2ib.ca.xn--mana-o5a.ca.xn--vk-dla.ca.pr>
āṇa.apāṇau.deha.idam.śarīram./
RvKh_2,12.1b:
dvau.pratyañcāv.anulomau.visargāv.ed[t]an.tam.manye.daśa.yantram.utsam./
RvKh_2,12.1c: ya.ānayat.parāvataḥ.//15.(.p.84.).
RvKh_2,12.2a:
uraś.ca.pṛṣṭhaś.ca.karau.ca.bāhū.jaṃghe.ca.ūrū.udaram.śiraś.ca./
RvKh_2,12.2b:
romāṇi.māṃsam.rudhira.asthi.majjam.etat.śarīram.jala.budbuda.upamam./
RvKh_2,12.3a:
bhruvau.lalāṭe.ca.tathā.ca.karṇau.hanū.kapolau.chubukas.tathā.ca./
RvKh_2,12.3b: oṣṭhau.ca.dantāś.ca.tathaiva.jihvā.me.tat.[jihvām.etat.
]śarīram.mukha.ratna.kośam.//

Likewise, I add B. B. Chaubey's English translation of them, from his
translation of all the additional mantras of the Āśvalāyana text, given at
the end of his edition.

6.44.25. I consider this body consisting of the eye, the ear, the mind, the
speech, the two vital breaths--the prana and apana--, the form (deha), the
two creations--inverted and direct--as the tenfold water-raising-machine.

6.44.26. This body--consisting of the heart, the back, the two palms, the
two arms, the two thighs, the two breasts, the belly, the head, the hair,
the flesh, the blood, the bone, the marrow--is just like a bubble in the
water.

6.44.27. (I consider) this head, consisting of the two eye-brows on the
forehead, the two ears, the two jaws, the two cheeks, the chin, the two
lips, the teeth, the tongue as the treasurehouse of gems in the body.

So as you say, Jan, indra is here the lord of the body. Thanks for pointing
this out, and for all the relevant references. I look forward to reading
the expanded English version that you are preparing.

Best regards,

David Reigle
