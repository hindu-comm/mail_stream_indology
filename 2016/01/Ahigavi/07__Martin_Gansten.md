In a panegyrical reference to his guru in the /Hāyanaratna/, Balabhadra 
makes use of the word /ahigavī/:

/atha natādīnām ānayanam uktaṃ 
sakalasiddhāntamaṇḍalīsaroviharaṇarājahaṃsagaṇitavidyācāturītāntrikapañcānanāhigavīpravīṇaiḥ 
śrīmadgurucaraṇaiḥ paddhaticintāmaṇau |//
/
I'm inclined to understand it simply to mean 'planet', but I can't find 
this particular compound anywhere else, so I can't be sure. In light of 
everything else going on in this compound (there's half a zoo in there), 
I'd be grateful for any suggestions from the vidvāns on this list.
