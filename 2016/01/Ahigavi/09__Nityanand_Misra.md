That is correct, however there is no word called *gavī*. Monier Williams
lists the word and even gives the citation *Śiśupālavadha* 2.68 but he (or
the Pandit he relied on) have clearly erred as Śiśupālavadha 2.68 has the
samasta form *śeṣagavī*. The form *gavī* derives from the affix *ṭac* at
the end of a *tatpuruṣa *compound by the rule *gorataddhitaluki* (5.4.92)
followed by *eco’yavāyāvaḥ* (6.1.78) and then and then *ṅīp* by the rule
*ṭiḍḍhāṇañdvayasajdaghnañmātractayapṭhakṭhañkañkvarapaḥ* (6.4.148). Hence *aheḥ
gauḥ ahigavī*.

अहेः गौः इति अहिगवी। ‘अहिगो’ इति समासात् ‘गोरतद्धितलुकि’ (पा॰सू॰ ५.४.९२)
इत्यनेन समासान्ते टच्प्रत्यये ‘एचोऽयवायावः’ (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.७८) इत्यनेनावादेशे
‘टिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसज्दघ्नञ्मात्रच्तयप्ठक्ठञ्कञ्क्वरपः’ (पा॰सू॰ ४.१.१५) इत्यनेन
ङीपि ‘यस्येति च’ (पा॰सू॰ ६.४.१४८) इति भलोपे ‘अहिगवी’ इति प्रातिपदिकं
सिद्धम्।

Mallinātha calls the Mahābhāṣya *pannagavī*. This and other references
to Patañjali as Śeṣa one may refer the Prastāvanā of
*Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe'pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ
Vimarśaḥ*. The relevant pages are attached.
