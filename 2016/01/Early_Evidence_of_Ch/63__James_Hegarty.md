Dear Colleagues,

I am currently working on Christianity’s presence in first millennium South Asia for an article for a new, rather inclusive, companion to Late Antiquity.

I am familiar with the patristic sources and, of course, the Acts of Thomas.

I am concerned to track down evidence on the Indic side (such as the famous  ‘stone cross inscriptions’ or the copper plates of king Venāṭū).

Can anyone help me to make sure I have not missed anything important? 

With Thanks,

James Hegarty
