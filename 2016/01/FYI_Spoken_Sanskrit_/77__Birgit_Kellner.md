FYI: Victor Mair posted an interesting entry on Spoken Sanskrit on the
weblog "Language Log" (that some of you might already follow):
http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23412

It's related to a recent workshop in Jerusalem ("A Lasting Vision:
Dandinâ€™s Mirror in the World of Asian Letters"), and also includes
reports and reflections by some of the workshop participants.

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
