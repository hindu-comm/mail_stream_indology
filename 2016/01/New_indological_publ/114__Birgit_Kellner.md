Dear colleagues,

the technical problems Dominik reported with the website of the Austrian 
Academy of Sciences Press have been resolved, I'm told. For your 
convenience, here is, again, the link to the recent relevant 
publications: http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/Sachgebiete/Asienforschung

(In the unlikely event that problems should re-occur, please contact 
verlag at oeaw.ac.at.)

With best regards,

Birgit Kellner
