Dear list members,
Is anyone familiar with local (pre-modern) traditions, textual, ritual or
other, involving Purūravas (with or without Urvaśī)?


In addition, I'm searching for the origin of the phrase "āṟu
cakkiravartti",  "The Six Emperors" (Tamiḻ), a list which has some
variations but usually includes Nala, Pururavas, Ariccantiran and
frequently Mucukuntan and Karttaviriyan?

Thank you,
Ofer Peres
