Dear Harry,
Asko Parpola discussed "the primary meaning and etymology of the sacred
syllable Om" in 1981 (in Studia Orientalia 50: 195-213) and summarizes his
theory of its (proto-)Dravidian origin together with other "fairly
convincing examples of Dravidian loanwords" in his recent book The Roots of
Hinduism - The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization, OUP 2015 pp.
169-172.
Hans Henrich Hock's 1991 article "On the origin and early development of
the sacred Sanskrit syllable om" appeared in *Perspectives on Indo-European
language, culture, and religion:  Studies in honor of Edgar C. Polomé*
1.89-110.
Best, Jan
