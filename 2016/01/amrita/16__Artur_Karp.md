My heartfelt thanks to Lubomir, Dipak and George for their comments and
suggestions.

However,  there is a however: I am especially interested in any
*pre-Mahabharatic *(if I may say so) mentions of amrita as an object of
contention, strife - something that is, independently of its supposed
material form (liquid, metal, plant), fought for, stolen, divided,
distributed, shared.

Thanks, once more,

Artur Karp
