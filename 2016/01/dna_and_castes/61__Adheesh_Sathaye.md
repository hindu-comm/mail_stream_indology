Dear Colleagues,


While one may reasonably argue that the corporal metonymy of varṇa in the Puruṣasūkta is non-hierarchical and instead based on a vision of organic unity, I would suggest (and have argued in my recent book _Crossing the Lines of Caste_) one can observe the beginnings of the hierarchical division between Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya categories in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa’s Śunaḥśepākhyāna (c. 750-500BCE?), where it still seems possible for a radical fellow like Viśvāmitra to assert that he is *both* Brahmāṇa and Kṣatriya, a notion that would defeat hierarchical divisions, but one that Śunaḥśepa finds a bit difficult to accept. 

For at the same time, we find in the same narrative an explicit condemnation of Śūdras (AB 7.17) and Dasyus, and a statement that Brāhmaṇas are better than Kṣatriyas (7.15, bhūyān vai brāhmaṇo kṣatriyāt). Admittedly this is in the context of being a sacrificial victim for Varuṇa, but perhaps that is not so different in Vedic social thought.

All best wishes,
Adheesh

So in all the four quarters, it means that four varNas are depicted as forming equi-status components of an organic entity.
