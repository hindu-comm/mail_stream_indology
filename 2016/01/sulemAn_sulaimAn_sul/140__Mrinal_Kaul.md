Dear Friends,

One of our students is looking forward to work on the
Sulemān/Sulaimān/Suleimān Caritra (?) by Kalyāṇa Malla (16th CE). There is
a recent English translation by A.N.D Haksar published by Penguin India.

http://www.penguinbooksindia.com/en/node/4891.html

I am looking for its original Sanskrit text. A PDF would be really
appreciated. Would someone happen to have it?

Thanks very much in advance.

Mrinal
