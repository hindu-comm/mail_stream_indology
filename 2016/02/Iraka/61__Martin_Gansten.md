In the astrological work /Tājikamuktāvali /by Tuka (1.41) there is a 
compound /khābdhīrakebhyaḥ /which, from the context, has to mean 'from 
forty and ten, [respectively]'. This is supported by the explicatory 
numerals inserted by several mss: /khābdhī 40 rakebhyaḥ 10/, etc; but I 
haven't found anything like /iraka/īraka/ in any dictionary or list of 
/bhūtasaṃkhyā /numerals. (Some mss emend to /-īkhakebhyaḥ/, which 
doesn't really help.) If anyone has come across this way of expressing 
the value 10 elsewhere, I'd be grateful for a reference, and even more 
so for an explanation of the word.
