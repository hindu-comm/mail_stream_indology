Is the five-syllable word part of a verse, e.g. begins with the 13th
syllable of a śārdūlavikrīḍita? Wondering if there is a possibility of it
being *khābdhikhakebhyaḥ*, with the short vowel: Is the emendation
with *-i**khakebhyaḥ
*by any chance? If so then the reading *khābdh**ikhakebhyaḥ *makes perfect
sense as *ka* in Sanskrit means Brahman, standing for the number one. Then
*kha-ka* would mean zero-one or the number ten*. *

The forms *khābdh**īrakebhyaḥ / **khābdh**īkhakebhyaḥ *with the long
vowels still need an explanation. With *khābdh**īrakebhyaḥ, *one option is
to assume *ira/īra* as somehow standing for zero, but this is also
problematic as *īra *means the wind: *īrayati iti **īraḥ*.
