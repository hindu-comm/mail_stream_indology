Thank you, Nityanand. Yes, the long ī is required by the metre (upajāti: 
/khābdhīrakebhyaḥ smarasiṃhaśāstrāt/). I hadn't considered /īra /'wind'. 
To represent 0, I suppose it would have to be equated somehow with 
'sky', which seems unlikely. But could 'wind' be equated with 
'direction' (of the compass)? It is in some languages, but I've never 
come across it in Sanskrit. If it were, it could mean 10. But perhaps 
that's wishful thinking.

Martin
