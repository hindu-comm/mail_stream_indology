Dear List,
At the end of N.J. Sjoman's book The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace, he includes a translation of the yoga section of a text called the "Maisuru Maisiri" which he found in the Mysore Palace. Does anyone out there know how I can get a hold of the Old Kannada version for this translation? I have tried emailing Mr. Sjoman, but no luck so far.
Best,

-j
