Thank you for your contribution.
All the mss of this commentary I could access are in devanāgarī.
I would add that certain devanāgarī śva and sva can be easily mistaken for
kha. Even if we do not consider the pronounciation and we rather stay on
the paleographic level, it is very easy to explain how dhaneśvara° could
become ca nekhara°. That's why I took for granted that ca nekharālamkāra is
just a corruption of dhaneśvarālaṃkāra and as such not worth taking in
consideration.

Best,
Gaia
