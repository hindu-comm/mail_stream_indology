Hi Patrick,

I'd suggest looking at Michael Meister's paper on the Jambū, available here:
https://www.academia.edu/784039/Exploring_Kafirkot_When_is_a_Rose_Apple_not_a_Rose

Therein (p. 110) he writes, "The earliest references to Jambūdvipa
surviving are probably those in Aśoka's inscriptions (Thapar 1973: 68,
199), 6 and certainly it is early Buddhism that makes much of this
continent's singular significance (Malalasekera 1937-38: 941)"

I hope this helps.

Best,
David
