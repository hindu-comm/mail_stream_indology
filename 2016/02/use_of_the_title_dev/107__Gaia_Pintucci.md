Dear List,

was the title "deva" used only with reference to someone who has already
been consecrated as king or generally to any (male?) of royal descent?

Arjunavarman I of the Paramāras (Malwa, beg. of the 13th c.) styles himself
"Arjunavarmadeva" in his introduction to his commentary on the Amaruśataka.
I was wondering if it is legitimate to conclude from that that he was
already on the throne at the time when he composed the ṭīkā.

Best,
Gaia
