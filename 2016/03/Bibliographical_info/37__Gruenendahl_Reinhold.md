Dear colleagues,

there are several references to a lecture Prof. A. Aklujkar seems to have given in 2010 and 2013 on "Language philosophy in the Mahabharata" (cf. Bronkhorst in "Archetypes and Bottlenecks"; abstract of 2013 the lecture available online). If it has been published I would be obliged for the bibliographical data.



With thanks and best wishes,

Reinhold Gr√ºnendahl
