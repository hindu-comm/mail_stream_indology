I wonder whether any of you have noted the changes made to the latest volume of the Pune Sanskrit Dictionary. The 9th volume was published 2011. When we should have expected Vol. 10, we now have the 2012 publication of Vol. 28!! It is both shorter and narrower than the previous ones. I assume that Vol. 28 is arrived at by renaming each fascicule contained in the previous volumes as a separate volume. For those trying to cite the work, however, this will cause problems.
