Dear Colleagues,

If anyone could point me towards or send me a pdf of an article by U.P.Shah entitled “Nāth Siddhoṃ kī prācīna Śilpamūrtiyān”, Nāgarīpracāriṇī Patrikā varṣa 62 Vols. 2 and 3, pp. 174-202 (I am not sure of the year of publication), I would be most grateful. I have looked online, including the DLI, with no luck (albeit via my mobile while travelling in MP).

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim
