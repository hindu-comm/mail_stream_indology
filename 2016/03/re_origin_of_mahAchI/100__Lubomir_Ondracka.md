It seems highly improbable that the Hebrew Sin (סִין) used in Tanach could be connected to China:
http://biblehub.com/hebrew/5512.htm

And this meaning is not attested even in Talmud and Midrashic literature (see Jastrow for סְיָן, p. 982). It would be interesting to know since when does Sin in Hebrew mean China. It could be rather modern usage, I don't know.

> It is worth noting, however, that the Hebrew term for China -- already in the Bible -- is Sin (סין), and the same goes for Arabic (al-Sin, الصين). The Persian Chin (چین) could just as easily have come from Semitic sources as from Indian sources.
