More on Qin. Indeed 秦言 in all the contexts I know of would refer to 後秦 Later Qin (384 - 471 CE) and not 秦 Qin (221 - 207 BC). After all, there is no attestation of the usage of 秦言 before Later Qin. Another argument against Qin as the source of cīna or any other similar derivations is that the character 秦 was a voiced sibilant which lost its voicing quite late (Old Chinese: ʒin/zin, Middle Chinese: ʒjin/zjin). Reconstructions vary among linguists but they all agree on the voicing. The Chinese linguist Zheng-Zhang Shangfang proposed therefore 晉 Jin (O.C. cinh, M.C. cjìn) as a better candidate. He further pointed out that China was referred to as "sinstan" in Syriac in the famous Nestorian Stele. Just like Greek, there is no unvoiced affricate in Syriac and c became s. Zheng-Zhang's analysis seems attractive to me because this Syriac "sinstan" connects to the very old 振旦／震旦 I referred to earlier (M.C.: cintan).

Many Sanskrit astral texts contain kūrmavibhāga type of descriptions, correlating directions with country names and thus give us some clues of the geographical knowledge of the authors. In early Indo-Greek works like Yavanajātaka and Vṛddhayavanajātaka, there is no reference to cīna. In Varāhamihira's Bṛhatsaṃhitā (6th century) we find cīna in the the long list of place names belonging to the direction NE:

> As for Dan's comment on the origin of China, or even cīna, I don't think it can be so easily answered. Qin秦 was indeed the first Chinese empire, but it was very short-lived and there is no source I am aware of that Chinese ever referred themselves as people from Qin; or conversely, I am not aware of the knowledge of the Qin Empire in non-Chinese sources. Chinese referring themselves as people from various dynasties did become common later on, and indeed in the Chinese Buddhist texts, the reference to the people of Qin秦, that is referring to Later Qin (384 - 471 CE), is found frequently.

In Shijia fangzhi 釋迦方志, a quote attributed Chengguanzi成光子 of Later Han, dated 205 CE, referred China as 振旦國 - country of Zhendan (from Cīnasthāna?). Later all, similar Chinese translations 震丹、真丹、真旦、振旦、神丹 are found frequently in early Buddhist texts throughout first half of the first millennium. This seems to add a Central Asian factor to "cīna", since cīnasthāna is not attested in Sanskrit sources. It is possible that the Sanskrit "cīna" was adopted from this earlier "cīnasthāna" or similar variants used in Central Asia. "Cīna" was translated into Chinese only later, appeared as 脂那 (zhina) in Narendrayaśas' Chinese translation dated late sixth century CE, followed by the more common 支那 (zhina).

In Ptolemy’s Geography Serica is northern China, while southern, reached from sea, is the country of Sinai. Cosmas Indicopleustes in the early 6th century had Tzinista for China, perhaps from early Arabic or Persian.

The s-form is curiously found in the name of orange in many European languages (e.g. German Apfelsine), “the apple of China”.

I was under the impression, though, from something I read somewhere (that statement wouldn't get past Wikipedia) that Cīna in Tantrika texts, especially the Mahācīnācāratantra, referred to what we today call the Assam-Burma region.  Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Northern Burma that sort of area.
