>From the numerous Chinese sources, it is clear that by the late sixth century cīna (or later mahācīna as Dan pointed out) refers to Sui/Tang China without any ambiguity, for both the Chinese, Central Asian and Indian Buddhists. Of course, we have the earlier 振旦/震旦 which connects to the Iranian Čīn/Čīnistān/Čīnastān, Sogdian Čynstn and Syriac Sinsan. It makes sense that it was the Central Asians who first associate the Chinese with "cin" and later Sanskrit writers adopted that usage.

For the origin of cīna, Geoff Wade in his Sino-Platonic Paper did an excellent job summarizing all the discussions so far. The various proposals include Qin秦, Jin晉, Latter Qin後晉, as well as Wade's own suggestion of Yelang夜郎. Unless we have more convincing arguments, it seems that we don't have enough evidence to say which is the definite answer. Personally, I would rule out Qin秦 on phonological (voicing) and historical grounds. Chinese referring themselves as descendent of Qin or that the memory of Qin gets stuck among foreigners centuries after the short-lived Qin Empire ended is not impossible but rather unlikely. Wade's own derivation of ʐina from Yelang appears somewhat convoluted and some of his arguments are based on the outdated Indological scholarship that assumes everything from the Arthaśāstra and Mahābhārata come before 300 BC.

Amongst a list of countries, it includes "the country of Cīna" and in parentheses, "Great Sui".)

Here suffice it to say that Mahācīna appears to refer to China proper in the Aṣṭasahāsrika-Prajñāpāramitā Nepalese manuscript of AD 1015, since it locates Mañjughoṣa there (mahācīne mañjughoṣe, which refers to Mañjuśrī at Mt Wutai).

>> Of course this doesn’t discount your point that C?na might have simply referred to a vague geographic region that these writers supposed to be located where contemporary Burma, Nagaland etc are. I suspect that the Bengali and Western Assamese writers use the term because it already signified a functional geographic “other”, in this case somewhat denigrated, (maybe similar to the medieval and early modern European uses of the “orient”?), and maybe also not so different from one of V.V. Dvivedi’s 20th century introductions where he compares the c?n?c?ra practice to Muslim practices.

Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Northern Burma that sort of area.
