Hi Deven,

I've seen cīna, without "mahā-" not infrequently. See, for an example,
Mahābhārata 2.23.19 of the critical edition. I can't recall where else off
the top of my head.

>From GRETIL:
02,023.019a sa kirātaiś ca cīnaiś ca vṛtaḥ prāgjyotiṣo 'bhavat
02,023.019c anyaiś ca bahubhir yodhaiḥ sāgarānūpavāsibhiḥ

Best,
David
