Dear Madhav,

It seems that they are sometimes the same, and sometimes different. For
example, H. D. Velankar’s translation of maṇḍala 7 of the Ṛgveda that I
checked recently had three scans at DLI. Two were the same scan, both
pretty bad, and one was a different scan, reasonably good quality.

Best regards,

David Reigle
