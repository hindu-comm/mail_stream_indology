Dear list members,

Does anyone have a pdf of the english translation by Alladi Mahadeva Sastri
of  "Dakshinamurti Stotra of Sri Sankaracharya and Dakshinamurti Upanishad
with Sri Sureswaracharya's Manasollasa and Pranava Vartika"

There is a text version typed out by someone at sacred-texts.com but I need
a pdf of the printed edition.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
