The principle is basically the same - there is a special power in the remains of those considered to be spiritually advanced. Compare European saintly relics.
Grisly, indeed.

In Śahr Safidon ki Kahani it is the guru (Dhanthar Baid, Mbh.'s Dhanvantari) who orders his disciples to cut and and eat his body - so that his healing powers would not be lost.

The place to look would be the texts and tales of "left-handed" tantra. I'm not familiar with the older texts but I do know that in places with famous burning grounds like Varanasi and Kathmandu the families guard the bodies to prevent tantriks from eating the flesh of the deceased. I have read about this in modern stories, and talked to people who have seen it. It is certainly very much still alive in the minds of modern Indians and Nepalis.

Best,
Dean Anderson
