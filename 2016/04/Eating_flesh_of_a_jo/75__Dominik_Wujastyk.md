Any hint of inoculation of course raises the interest of a medical
historian :-)  But I am sure you were not speaking technically. 


This is a fork in the conversation, but there are passages in the ayuvedic
literature where the authors worry about the issue of poisonous
caterpillars, and how it is that the caterpillars don't poison themselves
or their offspring.  It's a good question, I think.

Best,
Dominik
