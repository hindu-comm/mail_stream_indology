atithi–sevā


Ancient Polish proverb:


"Gość w dom, Bóg w dom"


thought to express the very concept of Polish hospitality - and usually
translated as: „A guest in the home is God in the home.”


But, the sense of the proverb is slightly, but meaningfully different: "A
guest [entering] into [our] home, is [like] God [entering] into [our]
home".


Idealists, those ancient Poles ---


But OK, nothing to be ashamed of.


Artur
