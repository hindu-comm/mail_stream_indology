Pushpa Dikshit comments on this “bubhukṣā bhoktumicchā” (Pāṇinīyadhātupāṭhaḥ Sārthaḥ, Puṣpādīkṣitaviracitaḥ, January 2011, Mahādevaśāstrigranthamālā 19, Samskrita Bharati: New Delhi, ISBN 978-93-81160-12-1, p. 37)

The word `kṣudhā’ is simply the Bhāguri version of `kṣut’ (nominative singular from the lemma `kṣudh’) as per “vaṣṭi bhāgurirallopamavāpyorupasargayoḥ, āpaṃ caiva halantānāṃ yathā vācā diśā niśā” (‘Kārikā’ #2 at the end of ‘Avyayaprakaraṇa’ in ‘Vaiyākaraṇasiddhāntakaumudī’). The ‘Vyākhyāsudhā’ commentary on ‘Amarakoṣa’ 2.9.54 confirms this by explaining `kṣut’: “kṣodhanam, kṣudha bubhukṣāyām (di pa a), kvip (3.2.178), bhāgurimate ṭāpi ‘kṣudhā’ ca.” This proves that

Now this form cannot be expressed by taking `san’ from the `sannanta’ root ` bubhukṣ’ since “śaiṣikānmatubarthīyācchaiṣiko matubarthakaḥ, sarūpaḥ pratyayo neṣṭaḥ sannantānna saniṣyate” (Kārikā in `Mahābhāṣya’ 3.1.7). So we simply say
