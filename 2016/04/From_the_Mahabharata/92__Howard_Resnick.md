The desiderative at times is used to indicate strong desire. Example: desiderative forms of labh — lipsu, lipsA. In MW, this can mean the simple desire to gain or obtain, or “longing for”. To long — to have “a strong wish or desire.”

In itself, the word bubhukṣā simply means a desire to eat or hunger, both literally and in common usage as attested to in the Amarakoṣa (aśanāyā bubhukṣā kṣut) and also in the Dhātupāṭha (kṣudh bubhukṣāyām).
