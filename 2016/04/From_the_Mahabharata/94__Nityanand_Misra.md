Monier Williams has errors. An example is meaning of the gavī as an
“independent word” for speech and the citation of Śiśupālavadha 2-68 which
is incorrect. In this case (‘lipsā’) there is no precise citation also.


The etymology (yoga) of ‘lipsā’ (‘labdhum icchā’, labh + san + a + ṭāp)
does not suggest any intensity in the desire. If one wants to go for usage
(rūḍhi), it is better to cross-check with Sanskrit Koṣa-s and attested
usages than take M-W for granted.


As per Amarakoṣa (1-7-27,28), there is a clear distinction between ‘lipsā’
which is listed with words for desire, and ‘lālasā’ which is explained as
intense desire or longing (grammar would confirm this):


……………………………………………………………. dohadam

icchā kāṅkṣā spṛhehā tṛḍvāñchā lipsā manorathaḥ

kāmo’bhilāṣastarṣaśca *so’tyarthaṃ lālasā dvayoḥ*


The Vyākhyāsudhā on above verses explains that the first twelve are
synonyms of ‘icchā’ (and also ) and the word ‘lālasā’ is a synonym of
‘atiprīti’


If any other authentic Koṣa or commentary on a Kāvya usage confirms that
‘longing’ or ‘intense desire’ is also a meaning of ‘lipsā’, M-W can be
accepted. Same for ‘bubhukṣā’.
