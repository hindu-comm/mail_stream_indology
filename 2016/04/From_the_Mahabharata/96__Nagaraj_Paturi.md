bubhukṣāṃ jayate yas tu sa svargaṃ jayate dhruvam

bubhukṣāṃ jayate yas tu  does not mean one who loses hunger or one who can
stay without being hungry. It means one who keeps one's hunger under one's
control .

kṣudhā nirṇudati prajñāṃ dharmyāṃ buddhiṃ vyapohati


means uncontrolled hunger destroys one's wisdom and drives off one's
righteous understanding.

Issue is bubhukShaajaya and not bubhukShaateevrataa or bubhukShaasaumyataa.
