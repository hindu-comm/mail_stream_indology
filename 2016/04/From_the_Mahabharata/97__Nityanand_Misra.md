The context is also relevant. I am copying my response sent offline to Prof
Artur Karp yesterday. Hopefully this will add some value to the discussion.

-------------------

I believe the verse has to be seen in its context. A Brāhmaṇa family,
observing a penance in which they ate only once a day, went without food
for several days in the summer (Jyeṣṭha) due to a great famine (not because
they voluntarily abstained from food). Then one day the Brāhmaṇa succeeded
in getting some food. However, just as the family sat down to eat, a
Brāhmaṇa guest (actually Dharma Himself) arrived. The family parted with
their own food to feed the guest. The Brāhmaṇa guest then uttered these
verses, saying that the host Brāhmaṇa had conquered Heaven by this act
(giving food to the guest even when the host was himself hungry).

“Since thou hast made this gift, in a season of great difficulty, with a
pure heart, thou hast, by this act of thine, conquered Heaven.

Hunger destroys one's wisdom and drives off one's righteous understanding.
One whose intelligence is overwhelmed by hunger casts off all fortitude.

He, therefore, that conquers hunger conquers Heaven without doubt.”

The Brāhmaṇa says hunger destroys righteous intellect (‘dharmyā buddhi’),
i.e. makes people give up Dharma. The Pañcatantra expresses this as
“bubhukṣitaḥ kiṃ na karoti pāpaṃ kṣīṇā narā niṣkaruṇā bhavanti” (“What sin
is not committed by one who is hungry? Those who are emaciated are
merciless.”). But the Brāhmaṇa family did not give up Dharma even when they
were emaciated. Therefore, to me the essence of “conquering hunger” in this
context is not abstention from food even when the body is hungry, rather it
refers to the Brāhmaṇa family's [one-time] act of upholding atithi-dharma
and feeding a hungry guest even though the family was itself hungry. The
host Brāhmaṇa and his family conquered their own hunger to satisfy the
hunger of a guest.

Another thing to note is this is not a prescriptive statement or
recommended action like “One should conquer hunger to conquer Heaven.” The
form jayate is in ‘laṭ lakāra’ (present mood) which is not used for
prescriptive statements: the ‘vidhiliṅ lakāra’ (optative mood) is. As it is
not a prescriptive statement, the author does not want the reader to
wilfully abstain from food in order to reach Heaven.

bubhukṣāṃ jayate yas tu sa svargaṃ jayate dhruvam

bubhukṣāṃ jayate yas tu  does not mean one who loses hunger or one who can
stay without being hungry. It means one who keeps one's hunger under one's
control .

kṣudhā nirṇudati prajñāṃ dharmyāṃ buddhiṃ vyapohati


means uncontrolled hunger destroys one's wisdom and drives off one's
righteous understanding.

Issue is bubhukShaajaya and not bubhukShaateevrataa or bubhukShaasaumyataa.
