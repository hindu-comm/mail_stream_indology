Martin Gluckman has developed a very appealing Sanskrit word-frequency
application, built on top of the data provided by the DCS of Oliver
Hellwig.  The prloject is still in beta-testing, and Martin would welcome
feedback.  Quite apart from it's technical utility, I think this
application has an exemplary user interface.

Best,
Dominik

Subject: Sanskrit Word Frequency Tool



http://sanskritdictionary.com/frequency/

This is very much a draft of a concept I had in mind to do to help learners
learn to most common words first but it has many uses of course and could
be used for serious research if taken further.

It currently uses the DCS database as it's corpus but this could be
extended if there were other word level databases.

Enjoy and would appreciate your feedback. Particularly about the date
ranges if they make sense to you:

Just click on them above to see the selected ranges.

Kindest Wishes,

Martin
