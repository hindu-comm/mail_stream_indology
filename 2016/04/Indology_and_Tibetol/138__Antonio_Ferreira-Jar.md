Dear Jacob,

That is terrible news and similar moves are afoot at the Australian
National University.

Have there been any attempts to try to procure private funding for an
endowed chair of Indology/Tibetology at Uni Copenhagen? Perhaps that might
be the only option left? In Australia at least, privately endowed chairs
are immune from these mindless cuts.

Kind regards,
Antonio
