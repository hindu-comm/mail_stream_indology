Dear all,

We just received news of this serious blow to the Department of 
Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies at the University of Copenhagen:

http://universitypost.dk/article/ucph-confirms-closure-small-humanities-programmes?utm_source=Universitypost+via+mailman+-+UK&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=Memo%3A+UCPH+to+close+these+humanities+programmes

Two centuries of Indology in Denmark seems to be at an end.

Best,
Jacob
