Dear Colleagues,

Has someone a PDF copy of M. Mehta's 1971 paper on the developments of the
Suparna myth?

Mehta, M. "*The Evolution of the Suparna Sage in the Mahabharata.*" Journal
of the Oriental Institute, of Baroda 21, nos.
1-2 (1971): 41-65.

Your kind help would be greatly appreciated,

Artur Karp
