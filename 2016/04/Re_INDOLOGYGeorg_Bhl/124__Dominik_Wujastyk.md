You've got what you needed from Isabelle, so all's fine.   But may I
mention that Bühler's 1877 report is in the collection of scanned
catalogues at http://catalogues.indology.info (Biswas 846), along with zome
of the other reports by Bhandarkar, Kielhorn etc.  Coverage is spotty, but
I add such reports whenever I find them.  The Bühler 1877 PDF is the one
scanned by GRETIL.

Best,
Dominik
