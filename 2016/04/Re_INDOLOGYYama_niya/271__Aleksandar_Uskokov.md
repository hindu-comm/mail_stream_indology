Dear Nagaraj,

No, nothing of that kind. I was just taking exception with the
identification Isvara = Siva in the Svetasvatara = in all Upanisads = in
Kalidasa = ergo in Patanjali as his contemporary. The idea of Isvara, as
your points well illustrate, is too rich for such a simple identification.

Best
Aleksandar
