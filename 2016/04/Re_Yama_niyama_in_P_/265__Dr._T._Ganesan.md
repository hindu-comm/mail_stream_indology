Samkara, Vachaspatimisra, etc. all belong to 8th century; whereas my 
point is Patanjali, Kalidasa are all much earlier to them. As mentioned 
in the earlier post, beginning from Svetasvataropanishad (which is 
indisputably one of the earliest Upanishad-s), Kaivalyopanishad, 
Atharvasikhaa, Atharvasiras, (where the words ISAna, ISa are also used) 
and in the Amarakosa, also one of the earliest Kosa-s, Ishvara denotes 
only Siva.

Note the Amarakosa passage:

śambhur_īśaḥ_ paśupatiḥ śivaḥ śūlī mahēśvaraḥ .

_īśvaraḥ _śarva _īśānaḥ_ śaṃkaraścandraśēkharaḥ.



The period of BhagavadgItA as we have it now, cannot be so earlier or 
contemporaneous with Patanjali or Kalidasa. And, definitely BG has been 
inspired by the Svetasvataropanishad for its stress on Bhakti.

Samkara appears to be mostly leaning towards VishNubhakti; it is is very 
much evident in many of his interpretations and comments in the 
BhagavadgiitA: at BG II.51, VI.31,Samkara states the liberated state as 
“the supreme state of Vishnu” (padam paramam vishnoH); in BG XIII.18, he 
clearly identifies paramAtmA with VAsudeva.
