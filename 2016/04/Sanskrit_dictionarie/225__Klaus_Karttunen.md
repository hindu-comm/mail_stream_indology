A small addition. Pandits did influence the European dictionaries indirectly. Both Böhtlingk & Roth and Monier Williams used much the so-called “Wilson’s dictionary”, which was in fact compiled by a group of Bengali pandits and edited by Wilson. Also Apte used this source – sometimes he gave its exact wording slightly abridged.

Best,
Klaus
