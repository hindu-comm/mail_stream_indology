If any one wishes to download this volume, here is the WeTransfer download
link for it:

I sent this volume to Aleksander a few minutes ago, and the link will stay
alive till April 26, according to the communication from WeTransfer.  The
volume is indeed no. 150 of the TSS, and not 151 as recorded on Worldcat.
