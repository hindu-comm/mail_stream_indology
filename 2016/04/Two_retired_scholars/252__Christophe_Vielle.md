Dear List,
I add to the forwarded information from the Bhakta Winand Callewaert (Leuven University), whose publications listen below are now on
https://kuleuven.academia.edu/WinandCallewaert
the fact that the Mimamsaka Jean-Marie Verpoorten has done the same recently, on the e-repository of the University of Liège:

Christophe Vielle

> The Ādi Granth is not only the sacred scripture of the Sikhs and a unique document
> for Bhakti literature in North-India: it is also a holy book that has an important place

> in no way suggests a lack of respect for the sacredness of the scripture. Human hands
> and memories were indeed needed to give form to the divine inspiration.
> 
> The standard reprints of the Ādi Granth, in both Gurmukhi and Devanagari, respect
> the initial layout of the first manuscript commissioned by Guru Arjan: on each page
> a standardized number of lines is given, and on each line a standardized number of
> words. (For this page-break, however, there is no uniformity in the different printed
> editions). As a result, the structure of the hymns, the stanzas and end-rhymes cannot
> easily be observed, and it is nigh impossible to make a workable word-index. In view
> of a complete Index, I changed the sacred layout and reprinted the text in such a way
> that the structure of each hymn is visible. Thus an easy reference system could also
> be created.
> In Part I, I reprint in Devanagari the complete text of the Ādi Granth (1430 pp.).
> In Part II, I give

>  
> 16. The Hagiographies of Anantadās,
> Curzon Press, London ; 414 pp.; ISBN 0-7007-1331-X
> Sometime before or around 1600 AD an ascetic of the Rāmānanda order in Rajasthan
> felt inspired to bring together in a poetic composition the different legends he had
> heard about the great Bhakta-s of his times: Nāmdev, Kabīr, Raidās, Dhanā, Aṅgad,
> Trilochan and Pīpā. More famous Bhakta-s he could not have chosen, and four of
> them (Kabīr, Dhanā, Pīpā and Raidās), he says, were initiated by Rāmānanda.
> The association with Rāmānanda was repeated by Nābhā and Rāghavadās in their
> Bhaktamāl-s, and by later tradition, but doubted by a.o. Parshuram Chaturvedi (1964)
> and modern scholarship.
> In fact, it may have been Anantadās himself who was responsible for this association.
> The travelling singers who memorized the parcaī-s of Anantadas were themselves
> also poets, capable of adding or changing a line or two. The result of their genius and
> creativity is a headache and a challenge for the text critic who looks at manuscripts
> and tries to restore what Anantadās originally must have recited. A study of the
> parcaī -s of Anantadās gives not only an insight in a very creative period of oral
> transmission. These parcaī -s are also like a video of late 16th  century social and
> religious thinking.
> 
> After a long introduction, this study gives
>      a critical edition of the parcaī -s, and an English translation (except for Kabīr), and
>      an edition of the pad-s of Dhanā, Trilochan, Pipā, Angad and of Rāmānanda,
>      based on the earliest manuscripts now available.

>  
> When around 1500 the Moslem weaver Kabīr sang his songs in Banaras , nobody
> could imagine that at the end of the 20th century he would be the most frequently
> quoted bhakti saint in North-India.
> Five hundred years after Kabīr was born in Banaras and after at least 80 years of
> scholarship, do we have any certainty that the songs attributed to him and published
> in critical and uncritical editions and translations, are by Kabīr?
> I doubt it more and more.
> Between Kabīr and our computer age lie 150 years of oral transmission (which never
> stopped) and nearly 400 years of scribal transmission. We have no oral recordings of
> Kabīr scolding his audiences and I take it for granted that he did not write down his
> compositions. What we have are manuscripts in which his popular repertoire was
> written down, first by traveling singers, and later, in a more respectful and
> professional way, by devoted scribes. But what do we have of Kabīr in those repertoires?
> 
> I argue that with certainty we can only say that the version of Kabīr’s song found in
> the 17th century manuscripts is the version then commonly used and sung by singers.
> Among the pad-s in the vāṇī of Kabīr we can earmark those that may have been
> popular in the repertoires around 1550, that is two generations after the death of
> Kabīr and one generation before the first manuscripts still preserved now were
> written.
> The norm is ‘occurrence’ in Punjab and/or Rajasthan.
> When everything is said and done, one question remains: how could Kabīr become
> so charismatic that many devotees, possibly during his lifetime and definitely after
> his death, were happy to insert his name as bhaṇitā in their own compositions and let those songs circulate with his name, not their own?
> What was his genius that eventually was changed into a social consciousness strongly influencing later generations?
