Dear list,

I am looking for the following article:

P. P. Apte (1973) "Maṇḍalārādhana (Diagram Worship in Āgamas)" in 
Journal of the Oriental Institute (Baroda) no. 22, pp. 501-24.

I wrote the Oriental Institute about it a month ago, but I never heard 
back from them. So, before I write them again, I thought I would give it 
a try here.

Regards,
Jacob
