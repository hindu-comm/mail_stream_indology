Dear Colleagues,

For a while now I’ve been trying to locate a complete edition of Hindi verses composed by the founder of Radhasoami faith, but to no avail. I have a volume of selectedHindi verses form the Sār Bacan, and a full English translation, but not the complete Hindi collection.

I would be very grateful if someone could help me in finding a physical or digital copy of this compilation.

With kind regards,

Jarosław Zapart
