Dear list members,
I have two questions regarding possible parallels to the Pāśupata
understanding of yama and niyama regulations, as explained by Kauṇḍinya in
his *Pañcārthabhāṣya*.

1. Are there other traditions which consider yama regulations to be
permanent, and niyamas to be subject to change, depending on time, place,
etc.? Is it a common understanding of the division between yama and niyama
among philosophers of Yoga, or in other branches of Śaivism?

2. Are there other traditions accepting ten yama regulations?

With best wishes,
Rafal Kleczek
