Arlo Griffiths *The Atharvaveda and its Paippalādaśākhā* Aachen 2007 p.145
states against my adverse remarks on the commentary and of M. Asher (JAOS
104 [1984], 599f.,) on the ‘entire text’ as mentioned by Griffiths (*loc
cit*), that his sources confirm that ‘at least a text of this name has been
in circulation’
