Thanks, I did not realize the text had māha- in place of mahā-.

‘mahārāja’ is an –a stem due to ‘rājā’hassakhibhyaṣṭac’ (5.4.91), which
carries over ‘tatpuruṣa’ from ‘tatpuruṣasyāṅguleḥ saṃkhyā'vyayādeḥ’
(5.4.86). The rule ‘nastaddhite’ (6.4.144) accounts for elision of ‘n’ in
mahārājan + [ṭ]a[c].
