I have not been able to read the entire text, but it appears to me that part of it reads:

tapāgacchaśrīśrīśrī

ratnaś[e]kharasūri

Mention of tapāgaccha  confirms that the object is a Jaina artifact.

Actually, I also have one with a date somewhat later than this. I think Losty, formerly of the British Museum, has published a book containing similar images. I will try to dig that up for you.

Is the language Sanskrit or a Sanskritized form of a different language? 4. Is it possible to figure out the meaning of the inscription (some of the characters are pretty worn down)?
