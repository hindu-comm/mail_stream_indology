Dear friends,

I am unable to consult any hard-copy (in Italy) of the *Mahabhagavatapurana*
.
Anyone could provied me a pdf of this edition:

Kumar, P. (ed.) 1983. *Mahabhagavata Purana*. AN Ancient Treatise on Sakti
Cult. Delhi: Eastern Book Linkers.

Also any bibliographical suggestion regarding the study of this text is
very welcome.

Best,
Paolo
