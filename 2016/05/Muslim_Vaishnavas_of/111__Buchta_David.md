Hi Harsha,

The first thing that comes to mind is Tony Stewart's contribution to Donald
Lopez's *Religions of India in Practice *on Haridāsa Ṭhākura. It is Ch. 40
in that volume, entitled, "The Exemplary Devotion of the 'Servant of
Hari'." That volume might have a good deal of other material that is useful
as well. I hope this helps.

Best,
David
