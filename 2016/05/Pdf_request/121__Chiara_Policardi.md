Dear Members of the List,

I would be most grateful for a pdf of the following study:

   -

   Banerji [1931] 1998, *The Haiyayas of Tripuri and their Monuments*.
   Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India, 23. New Delhi.

I have found only a very bad quality pdf on DLI.

With many thanks in advance,
Chiara Policardi

PhD candidate
La Sapienza University of Rome
