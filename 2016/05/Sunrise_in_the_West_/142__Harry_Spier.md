What confuses me about this quote is the phrase "And people, thinking the
night is over, started their home chores".

Doesn't the medieval  solar day go from sunrise to sunrise not from
midnight to midnight ( or is the Bengali calendaric system  different) so
the 12th daNDa would be from 4 hours 24 minutes after sunrise to 4 hours 48
minutes after sunrise. I.e.very  late morning not early morning.
