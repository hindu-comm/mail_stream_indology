*Dear Indologists,*
anyone may sand me the translation of the

*Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad: *6.4.13.20-22

I know it was translated here:

Sénart, E. (ed. and trans.). 1934. *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad*. Paris: Les
Belles Lettres

However other editions will be welcome, and if someone has the Sanskrit
transliteration I would be very gratful


*With the best regards,*
*Paolo*
