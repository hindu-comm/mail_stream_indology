Dear Colleagues,

Let me first express my gratitude to those of you who have shared their
knowledge with me. I was unwell and unable to thank you at the proper
moment.

And - now. What is the earliest, archaeologically confirmed, date for the
Sati-devi cult practices performed in the sanctuaries - known as pīṭhā's?

With regards,

Artur Karp (ret.)
