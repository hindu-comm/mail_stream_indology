In his obituary of MM. Prof. S. Kuppuswami Sastri, V. Raghavan says, “Kuppuswami by the popular name and Venkatavarma by his Saṁskāra-name, he was the fourth son of Seturama Ayyar…” (New Indian Antiquary, April, 1944, p.17. The link was given by Manu Francis in another post). How common is ‘varma' as a part of the Saṁskāra-name of Brahmins?

Thanks in advance
