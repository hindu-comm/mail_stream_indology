A student sent me the image below, asking if I could translate it.  I'm
used to devanagari in printed texts, and, while I can make out most of it,
I am not at all sure what all the letter-signs even are.  Further, I have
no idea what the language it is. If anyone can read and translate this, I
would appreciate the help.
