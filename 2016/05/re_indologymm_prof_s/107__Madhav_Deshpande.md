Dear Palaniappan,

This is interesting.  At my Upanayana ceremony in Pune, when I was 8 year
old, I was told to say the following greeting to the teacher/priest:  ...
mādhavaśarmā aham abhivādaye.  The addition of Śarman to my first name was
supposed to indicate my Brahmin family background.  That added part
"--śarman" was not used elsewhere.  I have not heard of -varmā as a part of
the Saṃskāra-name among Brahmins, but there must be regional variations.
