Hi all

I came across a reference today in Buston's commentary on the Vimalaprabhā
of the Kālacakratantra to the
chu skyar gyi sgru ma
or
kalahaṃsa-māyā

The referent to a water-fowl/gander/duck/swan/drake-illusion is not
familiar to me.

Mght someone know what this particular illusion is, and have some
references?

Cheers
James
