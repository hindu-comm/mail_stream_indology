Dear James,

It seems that no one knows of the *kalahaṃsa-māyā*. Can you provide the
reference? I assume that you used the 1965 edition of *The Collected Works
of Bu-ston*. I suppose that you meant *sgyu ma* rather than *sgru ma* in *chu
skyar gyi sgru ma*, since you translated it as *māyā*. But perhaps a
different word is meant. It may be worth checking the two different
manuscripts of Bu ston's annotated edition of the *Vimalaprabhā* in cursive
script that have been published since, for variant readings.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
