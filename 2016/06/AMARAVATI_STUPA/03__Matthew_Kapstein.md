This is pure speculation, but I imagine it that it could be the scene of the enlightened
Buddha's receiving the honor of Kapilavastu when he returns to preach in his native land.
This is described, for instance, in AśvaghoSa's Saundarananda. But it may be another
similar theme of the Buddha being honored by lay devotees elsewhere.
