 Dr.Rajam,

               There's  yet another interesting twist about good deeds and bad deeds. Obviously , good deeds are those  in accordance with the PanchaSheela .But Asanga, the 4th century Mahayana Buddhist philosopher ,in his  text Bodhisatta-Bhumi, categorically stated that a devout Buddhist may deviate from any of the 5 Panchasheelas  if he finds anybody who is violating the ethical code   viz.  showing scnt respect to parents or elder brother . or to a fellow Bhikkhu. 

                         It shows the practical  aspect of Buddhism, as it went on evolving  after Buddha .



                                                                ALAKENDU DAS
