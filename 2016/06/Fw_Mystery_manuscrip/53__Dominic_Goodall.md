It is true that photos of whole leaves might make the task easier and more interesting !

To add to Nibedita Rout’s impressive identification, here is a much more obvious one: it seems that IMG_0278.jpg gives the left-hand edge of a leaf that has the beginning of the Bālakāṇḍa of the Rāmāyaṇa (after the familiar copyists' maṅgala verse śuklāmbaradharaṃ viṣṇuṃ śaśivarṇaṃ caturbhujam, etc.)

Several of the other fragments you show (IMG_0269.jpg to IMG_0274.jpg) just have that same familiar copyists’ maṅgala, along with other formulae of obeisance.
