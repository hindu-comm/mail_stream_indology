See also the presentation of the problem of jāti in the meya portion of the Mānameyodaya (2, 3 = jāti, 1-18)
Kunhan Raja C.  & Suryanarayana Sastri S. S. 21975, Mānameyodaya of Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa and Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍita (an elementary treatise on the Mīmāṃsā), Madras, Adyar Library Series 105,  pp. 233-244.

• p. 243 (17 - Bhāṭṭa conclusion):  "Thus is established 'Brahminness'. What apprehends it is the sense of sight itself assisted by the understanding of his being born of a Brahmin father and mother, whose Brahminness is not corrupted; hence it is not non-perceptible either"

Cf. also (recognized as one of the main sources of the Mānameyodaya) the earlier Nītitattvāvirbhāva of Cidānanda (cf. éd. P. K. Narayana Pillai 1953, Nītitattvāvirbhāva of Cidānandapaṇḍita, Trivandrum, TSS 168 ; cf. republ. in K. T. Pandurangi 2008, Cidānanda-paṇḍita-viracitaḥ, Nītitattvāvirbhāvaḥ, Mīmāṃsābhāṣyapariśiṣṭena Tantrarahasyena ca sahitaḥ, Bangalore), the 20th topic of which is Jātinirṇaya, apparently more directed against the Buddhist views, without dealing with the problem of Brahminhood (abstract in Pandurangi 2008 pp. xvii-viii, EIPh 16, p. 114-15). 

I did not go into the provided Śālikanātha's text in details (and did not start to search into Prabhâkara's own commentatorial works where the original statements could be found), but from secondary sources, it appears that Bhāṭṭas and Prābhākaras differ here in the explanation. For both jāti is a perceptible category, but the relation of  jāti with individual is given as a combination of difference and non-difference for the former, whereas it is difference for the latter, according to whom the apposition (individual - universal) is through inherence. Prābhākaras admit the existence of genus/class of substance, but refuse to accept the existence of genus of quality and action. 
And according to Prābhākaras, differently from the case of cowness, Brahminhood or Kṣatriyahood are not considered as real jāti:

• MM p. 239 (- 9): "Although the genus is thus established, the Guru [Prabhâkara] says that, since its cognition is invariably controlled by the knowledge of the earlier form, existence, soundness, Brahminness, etc. which have not that knowledge are non-existent".

So the debate referred to could be internal to Mimamsakas rather than between Mimamsakas and Buddhists.

Best wishes,

Christophe

> 
> The issue for Kumārila is mainly the perceptibility of universals, as H. explains. The varṇas pose a sort of test case. It's not at all clear that one can just SEE that someone is a brahmin. K. argues that, even though various factors may be required to stimulate perception of a universal - in the case of Brahminhood, for instance, being told the person's lineage - it is perceptible nonetheless. Cf. Ślokavārttika Vanavāda 26-29, where the problem is discussed in more general terms; other problematic cases are mentioned there (e.g., how does one perceive gheeness in melted ghee? - by smelling or tasting it!). Some universals may be more difficult to perceive than others, but even if one has to climb to the top of a mountain in order to see something (presumably something very far away), that does not make it not perceptible (na hi yad giriśṛṅgam āruhya gṛhyate tad apratyakṣam, TV 1.2.2).
> 
> There may be certain cultural prejudices in the background of Kumārila's discussion (here I'm thinking of what Dominik wrote and some of the things Halbfass says: Brahminhood is determined by a universal, not by conduct; it is inherent in someone; there's certainly no social mobility here!), but ultimately I think he is concerned to defend the notion that real (eternal) universals, which are perceptible, as opposed to the pseudo-universals of the Buddhists (apohas), are the meanings of words. Since the universal cowness is perceptible, we can SEE that that is the meaning of the word "cow" when someone points to a cow and says, "That is called a cow." Otherwise, it is not clear how the connected between word and meaning could ever be established.

It's on my back-burner, but I've long wondered whether Sanskritic narratives about jati and varna can be thought about in ways similar to eighteenth and nineteenth century European narratives about races and species.  Were people of different varnas formally considered to be of different "species?"   It's a bit shocking to think in these terms, but I've been wondering about it.  If you ever put flesh on these bones, one way or another, or can point me to existing discussions on this, I'd be really interested.

The question is whether the jāti of Brahmins, etc. is like the jāti of cow-ness, etc. in being empirically observable or directly perceivable.  Jayanta refers to those who say that verbal/textual testimony alone (śabdamātreṇa) establishes the four-varṇa system.  This prefigures an argument made in Vijñāneśvara’s Mitākṣarā (on Yaj 1.90) where the same distinction is drawn to refute an objection.
