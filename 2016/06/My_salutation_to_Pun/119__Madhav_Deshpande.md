My salutation to Pune (after reaching home in Ann Arbor):

सा पुण्या नगरी यया चिरतरं बाल्ये सुखं वर्धित: ।
दीपस्तम्भसमैरनेकगुरुभिर्यत्नैश्चिरं शिक्षित: ।।
यत्रानेकसुह्रद्वरै: सह मया सख्यं समासादितम् ।
दूरस्थोऽपि न विस्मरामि नगरीं तां पुण्यनाम्नीमहम् ।।

"That is the City of Pune that raised me for long in happiness, where I was
trained for long with great effort by teachers who were my guiding lights,
and where I found great friendship with many wonderful friends. I cannot
forget that City of Pune, even though I am far away from it."
