My comic Sanskrit verse about morning in Pune:

भुक्कां कुक्कुरपण्डिता विदधते, क्रोशन्ति कर्णे पिका: ।
नालीष्वागमनाज्जलस्य सुदिने धावन्ति भाण्डै: स्त्रिय: ।।
शालां गन्तुमनुत्सुकाश्च शिशवो निद्रालव: स्वे गृहे ।
कार्यार्थं गमनोद्यताश्च तरुणा:, जागर्ति पुण्या पुरी ।।

"The learned dogs start barking, and the cuckoo birds shout in the ears. On
a good day, with the arrival of water in the taps, women rush with buckets.
Kids, not eager to go to school are sleepy in their homes, while the young
[= IT workers] get going for their work. Thus wakes up the Pune city."

Don't take it seriously! It is a joke!
