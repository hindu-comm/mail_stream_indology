Dear Indologists,

I would appreciate if anyone can share the following article by Gregory Schopen.
'What's in a Name?: The Religious Function of the Early Donative Inscriptions', in Unseen Presence: The Buddha and Sanchi, Vidya Dehejia (ed.), Mumbai: Marg Publications, 1996, pp. 58-73. 

Thank you very much in advance.

Regards,
Palaniappan
