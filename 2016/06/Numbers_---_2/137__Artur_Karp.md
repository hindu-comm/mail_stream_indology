Dear List,

*51*

According to tradition there are 51 Åšakti-pithas; 51 sanctuaries devoted to
(propagating the cult of) a particular member of the Devi's body.

Is there somewhere in the Hindu tradition a mention of the idea of *human
body* numbering 51 elements?

Why 51? And not, for example - 60?

Thanking you in advance,

Artur Karp (ret.)
