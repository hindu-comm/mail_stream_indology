Dear list members,

We have added two more on-line readers to sa.msaadhanii -- Sanskrit
Computational Tools at the University of Hyderabad.

These two readers are --
SrimadbhagavadGeeta and
Śiśupālavadha of Māgha (Cantos 1-IV).

These on-line readers have following features:

For every shloka its padapaa.tha, anvaya, Hindi and English translation,
along with the Morphological Analysis of every word, compound analysis of
every compound and complete sentential analysis are provided.

These readers help one to read the original text on-line, with all
necessary analysis at the click of a button.

The readers are available on the mirror site at
http://52.25.246.194/scl/sbg/main.html
and http://52.25.246.194/scl/shishu

and also on the University server at (This server has some network
problems, and hence may be inaccessible during power cuts and during
week-ends)
http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/sbg/main.html, and
http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/shishu

The readers are developed semi-automatically, using the analysis produced
by tools developed at the University of Hyderabad, followed by a manual
correction.
