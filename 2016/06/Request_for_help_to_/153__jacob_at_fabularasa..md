Dear all,

I need help identifying the intended deity in the center of the attached 
top panel from a gyān caupaṛ (Snakes & Ladders) chart. The spot is 
usually reserved for Viṣṇu/Kṛṣṇa (Vaikuṇṭha is in sq. 68 below), but I 
wonder if here it might be a second Śiva, his son Kārttikeya, or someone 
else entirely.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Kind regards,
Jacob
