> At least in Pāṇini's understanding, the words vatsa+la and aṃsa+la are derived respectively in the sense of kāma "love" and bala "strength," sūtra: vatsāṃsābhyāṃ kāmabale (P. 5.2.98).  Thus, for Pāṇini, these words mean "loving, affectionate" and "strong," respectively.  That meaning for aṃsala would not fit the Śatapatha passage: aśnāmy evāham aṃsalaṃ ced bhavati, suggesting that the word had some other meaning making the meat more edible/desirable, and hence "tender" is a likely contextual meaning.  May be "plump, juicy".
