Dear list members

A slightly edited version of the Rāmāyaṇa-centric interpretation of the
Māheśvarasūtra-s (Śivasūtra-s) in Sanskrit grammar from the ‘Prastāvanā’
(introduction) of the “Adhyātmarāmāyāṇe’pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ Vimarśaḥ” has
been published as a four-page article with the title “Māheśvarasūtreṣu
Rāmakathā” in the upcoming (July 2016) edition of “Sambhāṣaṇasandeśaḥ”
(published by Samskrita Bharati), the largest circulating Sanskrit magazine
in the world. The PDF of the proof is attached with this email. Many thanks
to the editorial board of the magazine for publishing the article. Special
thanks to Vidvān Janardana Hegde for sharing the proof.

The work “Adhyātmarāmāyāṇe’pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ Vimarśaḥ” was authored
by Ācārya Giridharalāla Miśra ‘Prajñācakṣu’, now known as Jagadguru
Rāmānandācārya Svāmī Rāmabhadrācārya, in 1981. It was last published in its
third edition which was edited with more than 1,000 footnotes by me in
2015. The third edition can be read and downloaded under
https://www.academia.edu/25018408/Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe_Apāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ_Vimarśaḥ
.

Please forward this to those who may be interested.

Thanks, Nityanand
