Dear Peter

Just in case you're not aware of it, Sanderson's (2006: 57ff.) "The Date of
Sadyojyotis and Bṛhaspati" deals with the the Haravijaya's use of the
terminology and authoritative texts of various Śaiva systems, in particular
Saiddhāntika scriptures and works by Sadyojyotis and Bṛhaspati.
About the Haravijaya he writes:
"This contains in its sixth chapter a long hymn to Śiva (6.13-187) in
which the poet has Spring praise that deity as the true nature of the
diverse highest realities venerated in India’s religious systems, using the
terminology of each and working in paraphrases of formulations found in
their authoritative texts. Among these systems is the Siddhānta, though
nothing so prosaic as an explicit statement to this effect is allowed to
compromise the obliquity required of fine verse composed for the
delectation of the court. In the verses of the hymn that draw on the
Siddhānta we can detect echoes of the scriptures
Svāyambhuvasūtrasaṅgraha, Rauravasūtrasaṅgraha, and
Mataṅgapārameśvara, and also of Sadyojyotis’ Svāyambhuvavṛtti and
Bṛhaspati’s Śivatanu."

He goes on to give specific cases, for example Haravijaya 6:161 is based on
Sadyojyotis' Svāyambhuvavŗtti ad 3:16, and Haravijaya 6:139 is based on
Svāyambhuvavŗtti ad 3:11–13.  However the article does not help with
6:170 or the verse cited in the commentary ad loc.

I have found numerous verses beginning prākṛto vaikṛtaś caiva (mostly in
Purāṇas and Āyurvedic texts) and some verses beginning sāttviko rājasaś
caiva (for example in the Śāntiparvan of the Mahābhārata) but none of these
give a list of 8.

Yours Alex
