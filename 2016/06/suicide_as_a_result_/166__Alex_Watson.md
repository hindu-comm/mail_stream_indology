Dear List Members

A colleague, Madhavi Menon, who is writing a book entitled 'A History of
Desire in India', has asked me the following question.  All help
appreciated; I will forward your responses to her.

"Are there any narratives in Sanskrit/Buddhist
literature/philosophy/history that talk about suicide, or ātma-hatyā,
specifically in relation to love and desire?"

Yours Alex
