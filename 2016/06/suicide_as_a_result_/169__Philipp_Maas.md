Dear Dermot and all,

The story of the “Weaver as Viṣṇu” occurs indeed in Pūrnabhadra’s recension
of the Patañcatntra as well as in the exemplar of this recension, the
so-called *textus simplicior*. Pūrnabhadra censored the narrative strongly
from the perspective of conservative smārta-Hinduism and left out the
motive of suicide out of desire for the princess, which, accordingly only
occurs in the *textus simplicior*.



For a more comprehensive analysis of the two versions of the narrative see
my “On Discourses of Dharma and the Pañcatantra.” *Wiener Zeitschrift für
die Kunde Südasiens* 55 (2013-2014), p. 5-31, of which you find a pre-print
draft version here
<https://www.academia.edu/13986474/On_Discourses_of_Dharma_and_the_Pa%C3%B1catantra>
.



Best wishes,



Philipp
