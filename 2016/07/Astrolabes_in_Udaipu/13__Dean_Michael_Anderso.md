The Jantar Mantar Observatory at the royal palace in Jaipur has huge astronomical instruments. Someone at the museum might know someone who still makes astrolabes. Just a guess.

Dean

Dear List,

I am in Udaipur and, trying to find astrolabes or other instruments (ancient or new), I only meet shop's tenants who propose me to find an astrolabe (new) but need time for that. I suppose they know people who are still able to make these instruments (as S.R.Sarma ensured me to exist in Udaipur), but of course they don't want to give me more details. Does anybody know more about this ?

Lecturer on Science and Civilization of India, University of Brussels
