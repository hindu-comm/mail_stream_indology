Dear list members,

I was requested to include some bibliographic information with the new
etext announcements of Muktabodha.  In the future I'll do that.
Bibliographic information is included with each etext both at the top of
the transliterated etext (not at the top of the devanagari pdf).  It also
is included on the website for each text when you click on its title.

The cursory bibliographic information for the last announcement of new
etexts is:
