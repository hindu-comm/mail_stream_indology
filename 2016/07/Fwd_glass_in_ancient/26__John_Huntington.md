In the northern Indic regions of what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan,
there was a substantial number of glass objects found at Begram and some
blue glass blocks (paving tiles?) around the stupa at Butkara I in Swat.
The Begram material is probably imported but the big blocks of blue glass
at Butkara I may have been produced locally.

The Begram material is published in the J. Hackin: Memoires de la
Delegation Archeologique Francaise en Afghanistan, *Recherches
Arceologiques a Begram* Chantier No. 2  (1937), Text and Planches (2 vols)
and *Nouvelles Recherches Archeologiques a Begram* (ancienne Kapici)
(1939-1940) Text and Planches (2 books).

I am not sure of the blue glass from Butkara I was ever published.
