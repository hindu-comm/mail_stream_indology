​*Addendum*

The earliest translation of the Ṛgveda (1876) by no less a Vedic scholar
than Alfred Ludwig renders *hári *by "gelb" (yellow).

M. Mayrhofer's Etymological Dictionary of Old Indo-Aryan(2006) indirectly
confirms Ludwig's early rendering. Mayrhofer determines the original
meaning of *hári*- as "pale, yellowish; yellowish steed":


10.23.4 (= Ludwig’s translation No. 631)

„Indra beschnaubt seinen *gelben bart*“

(Ludwig, Transl. Vol. 2., Prag 1876, p. 242)



10.96.8 (=Ludwig’s translation No. 645)

„der mit *gelbem barte*, mit *gelbem haare*“

(Ludwig, Transl. Vol. 2., Prag 1876, p. 258)



M. Mayrhofer, EWA (Vol. 2, Heidelberg 1996, p. 805 s.v. *hari*-)

„Adj. *fahl, gelblich*, grünlich, m. *gelbliches Roß* (RV +).“


Thus there is no linguistic or notional derivation from "gold" recognisable
in ṛgvedic *hári*. Translating it nonetheless by "golden" (or cognate
adjectives) would - according to established standards of (not only
Sanskrit) philology - call for a sound justification.
