Namo vṛttavidvadbhyaḥ:

Balabhadra's /Hāyanaratna /contains the following quotation from an 
astrological work no longer extant:

/saṃtāpa-sahamam aharniśam indor mandāntaṃ ṣaṣṭhataḥ pātaḥ |//
/
'The /sahama /of affliction by day and night is [the distance] from the 
moon up to Saturn; the casting out is [done] from the sixth.'

Ignoring the technical content for the present, I am puzzled by the 
metre. All other quotations from the same work are in āryā, and the 
present half-stanza looks like it too, except for the initial word 
(/saṃtāpa-/). Is there a variant of āryā that would allow for these 
extra 5 morae? All the mss of the /Hāyanaratna /available to me agree on 
the reading.
