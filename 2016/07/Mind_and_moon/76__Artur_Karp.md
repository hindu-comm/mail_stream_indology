> Or is it that the mind, like the moon, is constant though its content
continually changes?

I'd go - intuitively - for it.

And, that the Moon, like mind, doesn't possess its own light. It *reflects
light*, and passes it on. Mind? It *reflects ideas* (comparable to light,
enlightening), and passes them on.

Best,
