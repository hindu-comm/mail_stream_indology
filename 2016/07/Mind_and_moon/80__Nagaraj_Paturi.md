------- I think this is a good way of going about it. ; similarly, moon is
pitr loka; pitr loka is mano loka; (ancestors live in the memries of the
S'raadha kartaa , S'raadha yajammana); Once they are 'promoted' from 'pitr'
stage, they get elevated to Aaditya (Sun) loka. pitr, pitaamaha,
prapitaamaha are at the 'moon' (pitr) level. prapitaamaha's father and his
father onwards all the older ancestors are promoted to aaditya loka. (go
beyond the mind/memory level)
