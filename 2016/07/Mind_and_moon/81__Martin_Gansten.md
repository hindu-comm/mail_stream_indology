That was my first thought, too. We
should remember, though, that the astrological correspondence between
the moon and mind does not originate in India but is present already in
the early Greek astrological corpus. IF this should turn out to be a
Greek contribution to the astral lore taken over from Mesopotamia and
Egypt, we could be looking at a very ancient Indo-European idea
(reflected in, or possibly springing from, the verbal similarity in PIE)
-- but I am no expert in Mesopotamian astrology, and it might well be
that the moon-mind connection was already present in that culture, in
which case we are either dealing with a coincident or with something
profoundly archetypal, in a Jungian sense. Perhaps the moon really is
the mind of Cosmic Man? :-)
