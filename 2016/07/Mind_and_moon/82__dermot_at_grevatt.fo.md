Dear Artur,

Thank you for helping my reflections by enlightening my moonlike mind.

I'm not sure the ancient rishis thought the moon only reflected light. But thank you for 
endorsing my suggestion of changeful constancy.

With best wishes,

Dermot

I'd go - intuitively - for it. 

And, that the Moon, like mind, doesn't possess its own light. It reflects light, and passes it on. Mind? 
It reflects ideas (comparable to light, enlightening), and passes them on.

Best,
