Dear Mathew, 



In Suśrutasaṃhitā (Kalpasthāna vii.1-42) there is a discussion on rat poisoning. A list of eighteen kinds of rats is given, along with the symptoms caused by their poisonous bite and instruction on remedies. 



I hope this may help.

With best wishes, 



Fabrizio

Dear Matthew,



If you haven't already spotted it, I remember in Monier Williams under Ākhu one finds: ākhuviṣahā and ākhuviṣāpahā: 



'destroying a rat's venom', the grass Lipeocercis Serrata and the grass Andropogon Serratum (both considered as remedies for a rat's bite).



I wonder if maybe the idea of venom had to do with a bite getting infected?



Best wishes,

Charles

Dear friends,

A bit of amusement during the summer recess:

Śāntideva, in his Bodhicaryāvatāra IX, in the course of his critique of Yogācāra,
argues that self-awareness (svasaMvid-) is not, pace the Yogācārin, a necessary condition
for the formation of memory. As a counter-example, he adduces "mouse-venom":
anyānubhūte saMbandhāt smRtir ākhuviSaM yathā//

His commentator Prajñākaramati unpacks this by explaining that one who is struck with mouse-venom
does not recall the incident until the memory is aroused by a thunderstorm (meghastanitam adhigamya).

Now, as we all know, philosophical examples, according to Indian rules of debate, were supposed to
have been such as to be accepted by all parties. We might therefore expect the tale about mouse-venom
to have been fairly widely known. My question is whether any of you might have noted it elsewhere,
and if so, where?

With thanks in advance for your replies,

Matthew
