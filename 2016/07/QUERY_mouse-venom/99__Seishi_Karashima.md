Dear Matthew,

Cf. **Satyasiddhiśāstra* 成實論. T1646_.32.0322a01ff.
問曰。諸煩惱何故名使。答曰。生死相續中常隨衆生。故名爲使。猶如乳母常隨小兒。如瘧病未脱。如負債日息。如鼠毒未除。如熱鐵黒相。如穀子牙。如自要奴券。如斷事證人。...
322a26f. 亦如四日瘧病雖二日不發。亦名瘧病人。亦如鼠毒未差除。故雷聲則發。(It resembles the rat poison,
which, if not eliminated, will still [故] cause an attack [even] by
[hearing] sounds of thunder.)
