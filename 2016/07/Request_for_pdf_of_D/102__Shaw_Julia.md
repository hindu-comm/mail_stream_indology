Dear all

I wonder if anyone has a PDF of the following?


Ruegg, D.S., 1980. 'Ahimsa and Vegetarianism in the History of Buddhism' in S. Balasooriya et al., (Eds.), Buddhist Studies in Honour of Walpola Rahula. London: 234-41


If so I would be most grateful if you could share it with me please.


Many thanks and best wishes,

Julia Shaw
