The adhikāra sūtra governing sandhi rules is "saṃhitāyām", "when there is
conjunction".  So when there is not conjunction, no sandhi rule is
triggered.

In the Mahābhāṣya, Patañjali does have a discussion about how slowly you
can speak and still be considered to be producing a vākya.  This problem
can be related to the issue of what counts as conjunction.

Best,
Dominik
