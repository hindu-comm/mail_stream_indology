Uttaṅka and Takṣaka.

The etymological meaning is not always found in names. ta;nc ‘gerinnen
lassen’ ‘let run’ is rare but Mayrhofer (EWA)cites post-RV instances like ā-
*tanakti* (TS);  *takṣaka* Mayrhofer - ‘Zimmerman’;=  ‘carpenter’. This
meaning is indicated in RV.1.32.2 *tatakṣa*. Here the etymological meaning
stands.
