For a layperson like me, the terms Uttaṅka and Takṣaka seem to refer to two polar entities (north and south). 

These terms seem to find a place in Tamil literature as “uttara” and “takshiṇa.” 

The term “taccar” appears in Old Tamil referring to Greek carpenters, specifically Ionia (“yavaṉa-t-taccar”).

This meaning is indicated in RV.1.32.2 tatakṣa. Here the etymological meaning stands.
