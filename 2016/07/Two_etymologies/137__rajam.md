I guess the terms referring to the cardinal directions have the root meaning of up/front (north), down/back (south), right (east ), and left (west). Here, I’m imagining we are facing the north.

I’m also imagining the Cartesian coordinates of the y-axis for north and south; the coordinates of the x-axis for east and west.

Thus, as Prof. Bhattacharya mentioned, “uttariya” naturally refers to an upper garment.

“tasar” referring to ‘silk’ may be due to the silk’s ‘flowing' quality. Just my wild speculation.

This meaning is indicated in RV.1.32.2 tatakṣa. Here the etymological meaning stands.
