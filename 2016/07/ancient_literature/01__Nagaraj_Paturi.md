Sharing a portion of Bheeshmaparva as a pdf here.

Though this may not exactly match with the passage quoted, you have the
word Bhaarata in the name of a geopolitical unit discussed in the
Bheeshmaparva of Mahabharata.

It has:

धृतराष्ट्र उवाच॥

यदिदं भारतं वर्षं यत्रेदं मूर्छितं बलम्।

यत्रातिमात्रं लुब्धोऽयं पुत्रो दुर्योधनो मम॥ १॥

Sanjaya's answer to this question is a description of the 'richness of
Bharata Varsha' .He describes  Bharata Varsha in that context.

It is said here:

अत्र ते वर्णयिष्यामि वर्षं भारत *भारतम्।*

प्रियमिन्द्रस्य देवस्य मनोर्वैवस्वतस्य च॥ ५॥

अन्येषां च महाराज क्षत्रियाणां बलीयसाम्।

सर्वेषामेव राजेन्द्र प्रियं भारत *भारतम्॥* ८॥


The following description from Vishnupurana may come close to the quoted
passage:

उत्तरं यत्समुद्रस्य हिमाद्रेश्चैव दक्षिणम् ।वर्षं तद् भारतं नाम भारती यत्र
संततिः ।। - Vishnu Purana (2.3.1)
