This is from a post by Sri V. Subrahmanian on another list:

 Here are two uses of the word in the Bhāṣya of Shankaracharya, just
informing us that the term was in use during his times:

ब्रह्मसूत्रभाष्यम् । तृतीयः अध्यायः । द्वितीयः
पादः । सन्ध्याधिकरणम् । सूत्रम् ३ - भाष्यम्
कालविसंवादोऽपि च स्वप्ने भवति — रजन्यां सुप्तो वासरं भारते वर्षे मन्यते ;
तथा मुहूर्तमात्रवर्तिनि स्वप्ने कदाचित् बहून् वर्षपूगान् अतिवाहयति ।

बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद्भाष्यम् । चतुर्थोऽध्यायः । प्रथमं
ब्राह्मणम् । मन्त्रः १ - भाष्यम्:
हे सम्राट् — सम्राडिति वाजपेययाजिनो लिङ्गम् ; यश्चाज्ञया राज्यं प्रशास्ति,
स सम्राट् ; तस्यामन्त्रणं हे सम्राडिति ; समस्तस्य वा भारतस्य वर्षस्य राजा ॥
