The Paṇinian form is indeed *dveṣāvahai* as attested in the
*Siddhāntakaumudī* under *luṅi ca* (SK 2434, A 2.4.43). I do not recall any
special rule for *vi + dviṣ*, so the Paṇinian form would be *vidveṣāvahai*,
and the form *vidviṣāvahai *would be a *chāndasa* usage where the lack of
*guṇa* can either be explained by extending one of the *bahulam *rules to
cover this case or as an *ātmanepada *usage from the *nāmadhātu
**vidviṣa *formed
from the word *vidviṣa* (=*vi + dviṣ + ka *by *igupadhajñāprīkiraḥ kaḥ*, A
3.1.135) meaning enemy by *sarvaprātipatikebhya ācāre kvibvā vaktavyaḥ* (V
3.1.11).

MacDonnel/Whitney may have missed this form.
