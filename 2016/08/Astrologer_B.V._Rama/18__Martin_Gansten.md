Apologies for cross-posting. I have been asked to contribute a 
thousand-word article on Indian astrologer B.V. Raman (1912-1998) to an 
academic encyclopaedia of astrology, but have had to decline due to the 
pressure of other engagements. If anyone else is interested in writing 
this piece, please contact me off-list.
