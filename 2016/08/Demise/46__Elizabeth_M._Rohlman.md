I would like to join Drs. Brockington and Soni in expressing my sorrow at
the loss of a careful scholar who was also a gifted and generous teacher.
It is hard to imagine that I will no longer be able to call on his
expertise in Sanskrit and Gujarati linguistics. He will be missed, indeed.

Sincerely,

Elizabeth Rohlman
