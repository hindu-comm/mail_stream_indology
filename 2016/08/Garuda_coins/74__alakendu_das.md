   I am not aware of Garuda type coins in the Pre-Gupta  but it is a fact that Heliodorus , the Ambassador to Antialkidas, the Greek ruler of Taxila, in N.W.India, constructed a GARUDA COLOUMN in the name  of Lord Krishna. This also shows how  Vaishnavism influenced alien rulers during 2-3rd Cent B.C.
