Dear colleague,


Here's a bit more than half of the first line in quick transliteration, not taking the time to think about how certain difficult ak?aras could be understand contextually:


L1. tsas ca parito vrahma?a? s.ta | apas caivapavatsas ca parja?yo 'gnir ditis tatha | ?a??ikana? ca vargo '?am eva k[e] ? ? [rgya]se?ata? | tanmadhye tu vahir dasaddhipada[s]e[?u] sarva[ta] ? a[?a] ? ? ? varsva ? [m]idra? ? ? ? statha | vrahma?a? ...


The hand seems very similar to one responsible for several of the Orissa State Museum manuscripts of the Paippaladasa?hita (among them V/126) that I have described in ZDMG 2003; I forget whether the scribe's name and village are mentioned in one or more of the colophons. I have created script tables for this and other Orissan Sanskrit manuscripts that I can send you once I am back from vacation. I'll be happy to help you some more at that time.


I seem to recall having seen this title in many collections, so it may well be possible to get other (and else damaged) manuscripts of this text.


Best,


Arlo Griffiths

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help needed with Oriyan palm leaf ms


Dear Colleagues,

Could someone help me out with reading the first couple of sentences
of this (rather poorly scanned) ca. 17th century Oriyan ms of the
Bhagavadbhaktivilasa (attached)? I am hoping that getting a start
would help me pick up the thread more easily.

Sincerely
Måns Broo
