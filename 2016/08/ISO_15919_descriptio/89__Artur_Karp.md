Dear All,

I have just uploaded 7 files re *Romanization *of Bengali, Hindi,
Maldivian, Nepali, Sinhalese, Tamil, Urdu (acc. to ISO 15919, 2001)

at

https://uw.academia.edu/AKarp (Educational Materials)

The files are in Polish (entitled: *Zasady latynizacji:* j. bengalskiego,
hindi, malediwskiego, nepalskiego, syngaleskiego, tamilskiego, urdu);
abbreviation *trl *denotes ISO transliteration, *trb* - Polish
transcription.

Hoping the files might be of some use,
