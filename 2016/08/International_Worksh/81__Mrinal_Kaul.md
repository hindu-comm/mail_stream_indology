*International Workshop on Tantric Studies*

*Manipal, India*


*January 23-27, 2017*


Organized by

Centre for Religious Studies

Manipal Centre for Philosophy and Humanities

Manipal University, Manipal, India



*CALL FOR PARTICIPATION*



Centre for Religious Studies invites applications for a week-long *Workshop
on Tantric Studies* from January 23-27, 2017 in Manipal.


*About the Workshop*


The workshop will principally include a close textual reading of selections
from various Śaiva Tantric scriptures each followed by various
contributions and discussions. We will read the extracts from the following
texts:



   - • *Ratnatrayaparīkṣā* of Śrīkaṇṭha with the anonymous commentary kept
   in the Oriental Library of Mysore (MS Orlas P 269)

(session headed by Prof Francesco Sferra)



   - • *Sarvajñānottara* with Aghoraśiva’s commentary

(session headed by Prof Dominic Goodall)



   - • *Mokṣakārikā* with the vṛtti of Rāmakaṇṭha

(session headed by Dr Hugo David)


The aim is to examine tantric scriptural and post-scriptural literature,
much of which is unpublished or must be studied using numerous
manuscripts.  The *Ratnatrayaparīkṣā* is a ninth-century Kashmirian work in
over 300 stanzas that deals at length with all manner of tantric notions
connected with sound, language and sonic creation. A short commentary by
the famous twelfth-century South Indian theologian Aghoraśiva has been
published, but large fragments of what seems to be an older, more
exploratory and theologically intriguing commentary of unknown authorship
survive in a manuscript in Mysore.  The *Sarvajñānottara* is a non-dualist
tantra that survives in a fragmentary ninth-century codex from Nepal, as
well as in many damaged South Indian manuscripts. Its text can only fully
be reconstructed, however, with the additional help of Aghoraśiva's dualist
commentary, a further interest of which is that it consistently subverts
the text's non-dualism by ingenious distortions. The *Mokṣakārikā* is a
work on liberation by the earliest tantric theologian of whom works are
known to survive, Sadyojotiḥ (c. 675–725). A tenth-century commentary by
the Kashmirian thinker Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha has been published, but a recourse
to manuscripts reveals that it can be improved on every page.
