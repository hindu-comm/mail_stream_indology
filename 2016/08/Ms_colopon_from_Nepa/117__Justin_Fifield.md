Dear list,

In manuscript E 1160/3 of the National Archives of Nepal (Nepal German 
Manuscript Project)--also cataloged by the Asha Saphu Kuti as 5229--the 
following colophon is given at the end of the text:

nepālavarṣe yaṇaśarakhacare vidyānandena likhitaṃ hi śubhaṃ bhūyāt ||

Does anyone know what "yaṇaśarakhacare" designates?

Attached is a photo of the folio (if it goes through).

Thanks for any help.
