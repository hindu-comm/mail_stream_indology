Dear All,

Please use

   - http://catalogues.indology.info
   <http://catalogues.indology.info>

as the canonical address for the digitized catalogues collection, not
wujastyk.net/mscats.

It's true that the actual PDFs are sitting at wujastyk.net at the present
time, where I moved them last year, from a private directory at the U. of
Vienna.  But they will move again in the future to a more durable
repository.   Wherever the physical files live, the URL
http://catalogues.indology.info will always be adjusted to get you to the
right place.  This URL is also found on the main INDOLOGY.info website (in
the left menu).

And yes, the Mironov catalogues are there, under Biswas 827 and 828.

Best,
Dominik
