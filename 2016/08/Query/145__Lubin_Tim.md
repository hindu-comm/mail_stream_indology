P.S. re Tilakasvāmin — the name Tilakeśvara is also attested, though not common.  It seems NOT, however, be connectable with Tilakasvāmin:

There is a Pandya Tilakeśvara temple at Devīpaṭṭaṇam near Rāmeśvaram with an inscription; the deity is Śiva (with Saundaryanāyakī).

There is a Tilakeśvara temple erected by king Karmāditya in L.S. 213 = 1332 A.D.

Tilakeśvara is a tīrtha mentioned in the Revākhaṇḍa of the Vāyu Purāṇa (230.56).

There is a Tilakeshwar temple in Gujarat, but it is a Śiva temple so named because it stands in Tilakwada — or is it the other way around?

The Kurud copperplate grant of Narendra in MP (6th c.) was issued from the king’s camp at Tilakeśvara.  Nothing more seems to be known about the place.

Gifts of slaves and farmland by an official named Kumārasvamin to Tilakeśvara are recorded in the Cambodian stele inscription K. 664 (sometime between the 6th c. and 8th c.).  I don’t think the temple is identifiable.

So not much help here.

Best,

Tim

Vācaspati’s Bhāmatī on Brahmasūtra begins with some maṅgalam  verses, one of which reads:

mārtaṇḍa-tilakasvāmi-mahāgaṇapatīn vayam  I
viśvavandyānnamasyāmaḥ sarvasiddhividhāyinaḥ  || 4

This parallels Vijñāneśvara’s "āditya-skanda-gaṇapatīnām”

Govindānanda's Ratnaprabhāvyākhyā on BrS 3.3.1 is similarly introduced:

mārtaṇḍaṃ dhvāntanāśāya tilakasvāminaṃ mude |
vighneśaṃ vighnavidhvastyai praṇamāmi muhurmuhuḥ ||

Yours,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Query

In the Yājñavalkya Smṛti (1.290 — but 1.294 in Vijñāneśvara’s enumeration and 1.292 in Aparārka’s) we have the verse:


ādityasya sadā pūjāṃ tilakasvāminas tathā |

mahāgaṇapateś caiva kurvan siddhim avāpnuyāt ||

My critical edition has the reading “tilakasvāminas” following the Malayalam mss. and Viśvarūpa’s commentary. Vijñāneśvara and Aparārka (as also all the Vulgate manuscripts) read “tilakaṃ svāminas”. Vijñā explains tilakam as: ādityaskandagaṇapatīnām anyatamasya sarveṣāṃ vā tilakaṃ svarṇanirmitaṃ rūpyanirmitaṃ vā kurgan. So he takes “tilaka” as a forehead mark (ornament) made out of gold or silver and, probably, attached to a statue of one of these gods.

If, however, Viśvarūpa is correct, and the verb kurvan has a single object “pūjām”, then we have the compound “tilakasvāminas”, which nicely parallels “mahāgaṇapateś”.

My query is, has anyone seen the epithet “tilakasvāmin” applied to Skandia. I’d be much obliged for any comments on this.

With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick
