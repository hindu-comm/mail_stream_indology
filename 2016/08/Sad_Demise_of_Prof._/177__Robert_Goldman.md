This is indeed very sad news to have lost the generous and learned Professor Nanavati and our esteemed colleague Professor Tokunaga in such a short period. Tokunaga-san and I collaborated on editing  volume 2 of the papers of the 12th World Sanskrit Conference and I came to have enormous respect for his kindness and scholarship. Both of these stalwarts will be missed.

I count it a real privilege to have got to know him, particularly during a period as guest professor at Kyoto University which he secured for me.  Coming so soon after the death of Professor Rajendra Nanavati, it leaves a great gap in the field of epic studies.
