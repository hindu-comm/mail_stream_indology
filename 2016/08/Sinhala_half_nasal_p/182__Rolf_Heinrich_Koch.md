Dear list members,

there is one Sinhala sign consisting of a half-nasal with following ba,

like in a-m-ba (mango). 



Unicode has a half-nasal for n, e. g. paňdita. 

But I could not figure out the corresponding sign for the half-nasal m. 

Since the anusvara ṃ is also frequent in Sinhala, I am using ṁ for transcribing the half nasal m, e. g. aṁba.



My work does not allow the composition of signs with the help of an additional accent.



Anyone came across the Unicode-standard for he half nasal of m?



Best
