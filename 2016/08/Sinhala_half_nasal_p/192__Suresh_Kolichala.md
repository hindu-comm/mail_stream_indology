Harry,
As Hans suggested earlier, m̆ (m + Unicode Character 'COMBINING BREVE'
(U+0306)) is used for realizing m with chandra over, in many of the recent
linguistic books dealing with Sinhala. Similarly, n̆ is used for n with
chandra over.

Yes, you can submit proposals for new character and combining characters
for Unicode Technical Committee (UTC)  to consider. You may find the
instructions in the weblink below useful:

Regards,
Suresh.
