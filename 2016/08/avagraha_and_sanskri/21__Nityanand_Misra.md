The *Vājasaneyi Prātiśākhya* mentions that:

*samāse’vagraho hrasvasamakālaḥ* (5.1)

“In [the padapāṭha of] a compound, the avagraha has the same time has a
hrasva vowel.”

The commentaries of Uvaṭa and Anantabhaṭṭa explain that the ‘avagraha’ is
separation of a compound into its constituent elements:

Uvaṭa: *dvayoḥ padayoḥ pṛthaggrahaṇo'vagrahaḥ। nānāgraha ityarthaḥ।
hrasvasamakālo hrasvākṣaratulyakālo bhavati।*
Anantabhaṭṭa: *avagraho nāma dvayoḥ padayoḥ pṛthakkaraṇam। sa ca
hrasvākṣarasamakālo bhavati।*

However, this applies to the *padapāṭha* and not to the *saṃhitāpāṭha*.

Nowadays, the *avagraha* sign is used to show what is called *akārapraśleṣa*
.

In Vedic *saṃhitāpāṭha* or in laukika poetry, the *avagraha* is not
considered a syllable for prosodic purposes.

For more on this, please refer the entry on अवग्रह (*avagraha*) in *A
Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar* by K.V. Abhyankar
