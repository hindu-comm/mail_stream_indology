Dear list members


I am looking for a digital copy of


Gudrun Bühnemann (1983). “Budha-Kauśika's Rāmarakṣāstotra. A Contribution
to the Study of Sanskrit Devotional Poetry.” Publications of the De Nobili
Research Library, Vol. X., pp. 127. Vienna: De Nobili Research Library. AS
280.

Would appreciate any pointers.

Thanks, Nityānanda
