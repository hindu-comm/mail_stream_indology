Dear All,

Does anyone happen to have a pdf of the Jainendravyākaraṇa with Somadeva's
commentary, the Śabdārṇavacandrikā? The JV with Abhayanandin's Mahāvṛtti is
available at the Jain eLibrary (here
<http://jainlibrary.org/book.php?file=010016>) but I have not been able to
find the former there or elsewhere.

Many Thanks,

Victor
