Sokal’s paper does not have any matrix algebra. Perhaps it is influenced by
“The Language of the Gods in the World of Men”, which has a section titled
“The Geocultural Matrix of Sanskrit Knowledge” and in which superposition
principle,[1] matrix norms,[2] and equality of matrices[3] are discussed.
:-))

[1] “... the superposed matrix and its norms ...” (p. 26)
[2] ibid.
[3] “... an identical geocultural matrix conditioned the existence ...” (p.
199)
