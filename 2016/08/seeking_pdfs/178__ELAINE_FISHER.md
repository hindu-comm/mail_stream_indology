Dear Colleagues,


Does anyone happen to have on hand a pdf version the following books: John Carman's The Theology of Ramanuja, Gudrun Buhnemann's Puja: A Study in Smarta Ritual, or Naraharinatha, ed., Pasupatimatam? If so, I would be most grateful.


Many thanks,


Elaine Fisher

University of Wisconsin-Madison
