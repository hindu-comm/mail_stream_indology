Although MW does not give īlā or any verb forms of īl as a form of īḍ (there is another īl given in the causative, īlayati, ‘to move’), it seems safe to take both ailata and īlayā as derived from īl as an alternate form of īḍ. Similarly Śrīdhara Svāmī in his commentary glosses the words as follows: īlayā vācā, ailata astaut.
