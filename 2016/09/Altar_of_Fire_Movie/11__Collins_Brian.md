Dear Indology List,

After years of showing Altar of Fire to my Hinduism class and having to pause the video to explain some of the less intelligible dialogue, I have decided to create a subtitle track to accompany the movie. And since I have the two accompanying volumes, I thought I would also subtitle the chants we hear using Staalâ€™s day by day description of the rite. But before I undertake this, I want to make sure no one else already has and spared me the trouble.

Hopefully,

Brian
