Dear list members,

two forms of the contest of the vital functions are generalizable to 
contests in the political, social, or economic realm:

a) the sequential one (entering, or leaving, the body one after the 
other) and
b) the threat of withdrawal (leaving the body for a year, return, and 
ask the others how they fared)

Would anyone know about later (after Upanishads or Aranyakas) Indian 
developments along these lines? Did later commentators or social 
scientists build on these models?


Yours sincerely
