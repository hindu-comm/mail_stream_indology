There are a number in the Maitrī/Maitrāyanī Upaniṣad, e.g. I.4, vanaspatayodbhūta- from vanaspatayaḥ udbhūta > vanaspataya udbhūta- 

I think there’s some discussion of the phenomenon in 

Buitenen, J. A. B. van. The Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad: a critical essay. The Hague: Mouton, 1962.

If anyone could point me either to the old posts (assuming that they exist outside my imagination) or to some useful discussion of the phenomenon (does it occur and, if so, where; how is it regarded, etc), I should be most grateful.
