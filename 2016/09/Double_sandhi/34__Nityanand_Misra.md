A famous example in the *Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa* is from the *Ayodhyākāṇḍa* (I
have not checked if this is in the critical edition):
*na cīramasyāḥ pravidhīyateti* (VR 2.37.34)
where we have
*pravidhīyate + iti -> pravidhīyata iti -> pravidhīyateti*
The *Tilaka *commentary explains this by saying that the rule *na mu ne *(A
8.2.3) is to be split into two by *yogavibhāga*:
*pravidhīyatetītyatra sandhistu ‘na mu ne’ ityatra yogavibhāgena
kvacittripādyā asiddhatvābhāvajñāpanādārṣatvādvā* (VR Tilaka 2.37.34)
This is explained in further detail in the attached pages of
*Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe’pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ
Vimarśaḥ*.

Another example form the *Bhagavadgītā:*
*he kṛṣṇa he yādava he sakheti* (BG 11.41)
where we have
*sakhe iti -> sakha iti -> sakheti*

And this example from the *Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa*
*mama jāyeti sīteti* (AR 3.8.20)
For which multiple explanations are offered in
*Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe’pāṇinīyaprayogāṇāṃ
Vimarśaḥ *(see the attachment)*.*
