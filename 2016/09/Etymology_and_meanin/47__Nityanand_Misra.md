The *Prākṛtaprakāśa* has the rule (8.25)

ṣṭhā-dhyā-gānāṃ ṭhā·a-jhā·a-gā·āḥ
(ष्ठा-ध्या-गानां ठाअ-झाअ-गाआः)

which explains Sanskrit dhyā changing to jhā·a. Hence

dhyāyanti -> jhāanti
dhyāna -> jhāṇa

The *Abhidhānarājendraḥ* has a rather long entry under *jhāṇa*. It also
derives the word from *dhyāna *and cites the rule *sādhyasadhyahyāṃ
jhaḥ* instead,
which I believe is from Hemacandra's grammar.

Hope this helps, Nityananda
