Hi Nicole,

For what it's worth, the Sanskrit for the Padma Purāṇa-attributed verse you
are looking for is (with variants found in pāda b):
nāhaṃ vasāmi vaikuṇṭhe na yogi-hṛdayeṣu vā |
mad-bhaktā yatra gāyanti tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada //

It is quoted often by Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava authors: In Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmin's
Haribhaktivilāsa (8.284) and Jīva Gosvāmin's *Bhaktisandarbha *(under
pariccheda 269). Both cite specifically the Kārttikamāhātmya.

I hope this helps.

Best,
David
