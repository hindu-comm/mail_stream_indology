Dear colleagues,


Does 'quicksilver/mercury' (the liquid metal) ever get called 'Mercury' (the planet) in Sanskrit, or is this homonymy only a feature of European languages?


I ask because I am wondering whether baudha can mean 'related to quicksilver' and be a designation of mercury gilding. Apropos, does anyone known technical designations of mercury gilding in Sanskrit?


Thank you.


Arlo Griffiths
