Sorry for the obvious mistake in my previous message: Please read  
"long-short-long-long-short-short" instead of  
"long-short-long-long-short-long". The corrected message runs:

> The entire article can be briefly summarized in Sanskrit by

> prajñā vivekaṁ labhate bhinnair āgama-darśanaiḥ |
> kiyad vā śakyam unnetuṁ svatarkam anudhāvatā ||
> (view of Bhartrhari as formulated probably by his student: note, in

It is not metrically clumsy; prajñā vivekaṃ labhate forms a regular  
bha-vipulā (structure ra-bha with regard to syllables 2-7:  
long-short-long-long-short-short).

Best wishes,
Roland Steiner
