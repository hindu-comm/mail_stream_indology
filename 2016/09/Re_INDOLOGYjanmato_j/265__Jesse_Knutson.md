p.s. It just occured to me that though the verse is appropriated for, and
quoted in support of an anti-caste position by the Ramandandis, it probably
comes from a thoroughly brahmanical source, since really all it says is
that the saṃskāra is necessary to become a dvija, which is a tautology from
a brahmanical point of view. Far less radical on its own than the Buddha's
remarks about brahmins.
