Hi Jesse,

A slight variant, "janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ," is traced to the Skanda Purāṇa,
Nāgara-khaṇḍa 239.31 on the website linked below. The author of the website
article includes a screenshot of a published edition with the text
highlighted, but does not give any information about the edition of the
text. Still, I hope it is a helpful lead.

Ted Benke also quotes the passage in his dissertation (p. 267, see link
below), saying that it is "attributed to Manu," citing Radhakrishnan.

drawn my attention to, and asked me about the source, of a half-verse,
which he has heard quoted a lot in Ramanandi circles in India.  He is doing
some very interesting ethnographic work on the evolution of this order, and
told me about several inter-caste, Vedic पाठशालाs they have recently
established, incorporating sometimes even dalits, women, and adivasis.  I
have a feeling one of you knows the source. Thanks for your time. भवदीयः,J
