We are pleased to share below the schedule for the 8th International
Indology Graduate Research, organized by Charles DiSimone, Andrea Schlosser
and Jinkyoung Choi, which will be held at LMU Munich, Oct 29-30, 2016.
There is a particularly strong emphasis on Buddhist Studies for this year's
IIGRS as can be from the many talks on various buddological matters
including our keynote lecture by Prof. Dr. Jonathan Silk of Leiden
University titled: 'Einmal ist keinmal: “Thus I have heard,” many times
more than once'.

The event is free and open to the public but we request that those
interested in attending register by writing us at: IIGRSuk at googlemail.com.

The schedule, along with other pertinent information also appears on our
