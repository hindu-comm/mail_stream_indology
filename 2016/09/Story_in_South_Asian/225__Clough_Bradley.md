Dear Colleagues,

A colleague in Chinese Studies, who is working on a cycle of stories that involve a giant who destroys villages by defecating on them, was wondering if there were any parallels in South Asian literature. I was unable to help him. If anyone knows of such stories in South Asian literature, I would appreciate receiving references.

Many Thanks,
Brad
