I was really sad to hear about the passing of Teun Goudriaan and Max  
Sparreboom, who were my friends for decades, Teun Goudriaan since the  
1960s. While I have nothing to add to Herman Tieken's list of  
publications by Max Sparreboom, there is quite a lot to cover Teun's  
indological publications. As my farewell I list the following.  With  
regards, Asko Parpola
