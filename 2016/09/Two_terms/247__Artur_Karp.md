Dear List,

Would anyone take pity on me and translate this bit of the Sinhalese text
for me?

[Sent by Rolf Heinrich Koch:]

"daruva, Ajātaśatru rajjuruvan visin dhātu nidhānaya karavana lada, topi da
īṭa sudusu ārakṣāvak karav" yi kiya.
e bas äsū Viśvakam divyaputra avut vyālarūpa yukta yantrayak yodā daṇḍin
neḷā karana lada dūpayan dhātu garbhayehi ävāṇa puhupat kaḍugena
vānavēgayak hā samāna vēgayen sisārā divannā vū
yantrayak mavā,...

Sinhala Thūpavaṃsaya (2007) p. 109sq.

In advance, etc.

I would be especially grateful for the meaning of vyālarūpa -  as it is
understood in the text: in the form of ferocius animal(s) [like tigers or
lions] or serpent(s)?


Artur
