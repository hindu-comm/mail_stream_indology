Dear Artur

regarding your question vāḷa = snake in Pāli-sources  please see two 
references from the Jātakas according to

W. Geiger (1916), Pāli. Literatur und Sprache, p. 66: vāḷa "Raubtier, 
Schlange" Jā. VI 497 (13) and JāCo. I 99 (14).

Best

Rolf Heinrich Koch

>>
>>     "Dear boy! The enshrining of the relics has been done by King
>>     Ajātaśatru. Create a suitable defense for them." The deity
>>     Viśvakarma, who heard those words, came and prepared a device

>>     crystal and that whirled around with a speed equal to that of the
>>     wind."
>>
>>     By the way the word vāḷa means predators in other contexts too.
