Thanks for the suggestion, Walter. No, none of the six witnesses 
available to me has the form with /r/; four read /buḍanaṃ/vuḍanaṃ/, 
while two read /vujhanaṃ /(or possibly /ṣujhanaṃ/). But perhaps /buḍ/vuḍ 
/and /bruḍ/vruḍ/ could be variant forms? (Both seem to have the meaning 
'cover'.) I confess I've never, to my recollection, come across either 
before.

Martin
