I came across one occurrence, where pānīya denotes water in which plants 
grow: Ḍalhaṇa (12th cent.) - concerning Suśrutasaṃhitā 1.45.17 - glosses 
parṇī with pānīyapṛṣṭhajā (a plant originating from the water surface). 
Of course, this is not very early. A search with the Digital Corpus of 
Sanskrit might bring about more occurrences.
