My statements about Advaita vis-à-vis the two Bhakti schools Viśiṣṭādvaita
and Dvaita were not about ritual in a general , broad sense covering pūjā
rituals and other rituals of 'Hinduism'. It was about karma in the sense of
yajña and other rituals covered by mīmāmsā.

The debate is around karma - jñāna .

saguṇa - nirguṇa debate is different from this.

Advaita's position is that the compulsion of karma-performance as ordained
by mīmāmsā. does not apply to a(n Advaita sannyāsi)

Viśiṣṭādvaita and Dvaita say that even a sannyāsi has to perform karma.

A comparison of commentaries of Sankara , Ramanuja and Madhva on Bh G 3-17
is a very good sample for the three positions.
