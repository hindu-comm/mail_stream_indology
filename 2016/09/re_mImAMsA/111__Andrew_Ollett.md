Patrick mentioned that scriptural commandments "were originally meant for a
group of people in a different time and place," which is not the way that
Mīmāṃsakas understand scriptural commandments. They consider the
commandments themselves to be outside of time (and apauruṣeya, not authored
by any historical person), and their addressees to be defined by open-ended
criteria that cut across time and space (adhikāra). There is some
discussion of how these commandments are imagined to work in the
Mīmāṃsānyāyaprakāśa, already mentioned, which has been translated by
Franklin Edgerton <http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/264213>, and in
James Benson's recent translation of the Mīmāṃsānyāyasaṃgraha of Mahādeva
Vedāntin (Wiesbaden 2010). Maybe one place to start is the discussion of
adhikāra-vidhis (in the sixth adhyāya of the Mīmāṃsā system, and section
225 ff. in Edgerton's translation).

You may also want to consult Kanchana Natarajan, *The Vidhi Viveka of
Maṇḍana Miśra: Understanding Vedic Injunctions* (Delhi 1995).
