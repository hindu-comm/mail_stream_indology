Dear Patrick,

 *vedamūrti* and *śāntamūrti *kind of metaphors belong to a different
category. They belong to the category of figurative expressions. We have a
huge number of them.

dharmamūrti, gurumūrti are the most frequent.

rāmō vigrahavān dharmah type statements are similar.

ātman as 'embodied' is found in expressions such as śārīraka mīmāmsā as the
name for Brhmasutra( Bhashya)

Cpomparable to kōśas is sthūla śarīra, sūkśma śarīra, kāraṇa (linga)
śarīra. .
