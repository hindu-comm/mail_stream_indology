Thanks to everyone who has responded on and off list. I was also thinking
while I was cycling around trying to figure out how to cross the river due

<http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-15/south-australia-flooding:-weather-conditions-ease/7846202>
on
my street about Sati and śakti pīṭhas. This is a great example of the
relationship between tourism and embodiment.

Thanks again.


Patrick
