Dear indologists,

I was reading the CMS 16th ed. about the Chicago B Style, but I was not
able to find any reference to the use of footnotes in the author-date
system (maybe there is not).

I use footnotes for explanations that would weigh down the text---e.g. to
explain local names as Manobhava (Kamadeva), or to place a long series of
bibliographical comparisons.

Could anyone indicate to me if there is a chapter or any online reference
about the use of footnoteseither  for Chicago B or for any other
Author-Date system?
Any other advice is very welcome.

Best, Paolo
