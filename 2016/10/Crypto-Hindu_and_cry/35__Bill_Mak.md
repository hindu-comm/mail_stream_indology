Dear colleagues,

I recently came across an article on Chinese Buddhism by Ritzinger, where the author repeatedly described Mahāyāna texts such as the Lotus Sūtra as “crypto-Hindu” (!). I have never come across such expression although I am aware of a body of scholarly works which explore how Mahāyāna appropriated non-Buddhist materials of other traditions in the later periods. Stephen Hodge appears to have used the term “crypto-Hindu” rhetorically in an Indology-list thread in 2000 :

I found online also some discussions of Śaṅkara as being “crypto-Buddhist”. Can anyone enlighten me the contemporary usage of “crypto-“ in South Indian religious discourse, and its historical source.

Bill Mak
