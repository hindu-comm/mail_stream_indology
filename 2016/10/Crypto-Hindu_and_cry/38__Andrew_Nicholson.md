Dear Bill,

Not only did the Viśiṣṭādvaitins and others refer to Advaita Vedāntins as
crypto-Buddhists; in his Śatadūṣaṇī, Vedānta Deśika also labelled the
Bhedābheda Vedāntin Bhāskara as a "Vedāntin who smells like a Jain" (
*jainagandhivedāntin*).

I have never seen a similar term in the premodern literature for a
"crypto-Hindu." Might we find similar epithets in Jain intra-religious
polemics (perhaps a *vedāntigandhijaina*)?
