Before Rāmānuja, it was Bhāskara who referred to *māyā-vādin*-s as
*bauddha-matāvalambin. *Please see Chapter XV (The Bhāskara School of
Philosophy) in A History of Indian Philosophy (Volume 3), where Dasgupta
writes

Quote
Thus, at the very beginning of his commentary, he says that it aims at
refuting those who, hiding the real sense of the *sūtra*, have only
expressed their own opinions, and in other places also he speaks in very
strong terms against the commentator who holds the māyā doctrine and is a
Buddhist in his views[3].
[3] *sūtrā-bhiprāya-saṃvṛtyā svābhiprāyā-prakāśanāt, vyākhyātaṃ yair idam
śāstraṃ vyākhyeyaṃ tan-nivṛttaye*. Bhāskara’s Commentary, p. i.
Also “*ye tu bauddha-matāvalambino māyā-vādinas te’pi anena nyāyena
sūtra-kāreṇai’va nirastāḥ*.” Ibid. II. 2. 29.
In another place Śaṅkara is referred to as explaining views which were
really propounded by the Mahāyāna Buddhists—*vigītaṃ vicchinna-mūlaṃ
māhāyānika-bauddha-gāthitaṃ māyā-vādaṃ vyāvarṇayanto lokān vyāmohayanti*.
Ibid. 1. 4. 25.
