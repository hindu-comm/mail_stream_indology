Dear All,

This is a gentle reminder about the deadline (November 1, 2016) for
applying to participate in the *International Tantra Workshop* to be held
in Manipal University, India in the month of January 2017. Please check the
details following the link below:

We still have few slots left for potential participants.

Looking forward.

Mrinal Kaul
(Workshop Coordinator)
