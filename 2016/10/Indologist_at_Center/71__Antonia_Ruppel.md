Dear Audrey,

Many thanks for the links and the excellent overview. You're absolutely
right that we need to be aware of what is going on. Whenever something like
this comes to light about someone who is a colleague or perhaps even a
friend, it is shocking and uncomfortable. Still, the more information we
have, the better we are able to find the right side to be on here. (And
yes, I think that unfortunately there are sides here, and many of us close
enough to the situation need to choose one.)

All best,
     Antonia
