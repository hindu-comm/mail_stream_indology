Many thanks to Dagmar and Dominik Wujastyk for their replies so far. The 
reference to /kṛṣṇān ... strīpuṃso/ in the Śārṅgadharasaṃhitā is 
interesting. Perhaps I read too much into the expressions /asita-mānava/ 
and /kṛṣṇa-manuja/ in the Hāyanasundara.

Thank you. I'm still not sure what /bhavati ... chardir apy eti vāntim/ 
is meant to convey; I'll have to think about it. Any further suggestions 
are most welcome.

Is pittātisāra normally found in the plural? And is the condition 
considered to cause stomach pain? (/Bhavati jaṭharaśūlaṃ 
kāsapittātisārai[ḥ]/.)

Right. The form used in the text is kāmala (as required by the metre). 
But I am not sure about dadrutā (leprosy?). If pittakāmala is one 
condition, and dadrutā another, one would have expected the dual (-te), 
but the witnesses all read -tā or -tāḥ. On the other hand, the text is 
often somewhat ungrammatical (but syntactically rather than 
morphologically).

Best wishes,
Martin
