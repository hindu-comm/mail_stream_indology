a Polish portal discourage potential readers of the book?

Polish is an IE language, Western Slavic subgroup, over 50 million native
speakers. Polish portals are present, strongly, in the internet universe.
Learning one or two basic Polish phrases needed to move freely within a
Polish portal shouldn't be a problem for the learned denizens of Indology.
