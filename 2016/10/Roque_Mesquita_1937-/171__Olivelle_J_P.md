This is quite distressing news. I knew Roque and his family from the mid-1970s, and the last time they had us over to their home was in 2001. He was already sick when I visited Vienna a few years ago and could not meet him. He was a kind and generous person and a fine scholar. We will miss him.

He studied Madhva’s works from the mid-nineties onwards, publishing several monographs and engaging in lively discussions on his research as long as his health permitted. His last article “Rejoinder II: Madhva's Unknown Literary Sources” appeared in 2014 in the Rivista di Studi Orientali 87. His final book was seen through the press by his family: “Studies on Madhva’s Viṣṇutattvanirṇaya”, New Delhi: Aditya Prakashan 2016, 308 pages.
