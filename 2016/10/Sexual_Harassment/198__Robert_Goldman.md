One may add Indra’s rape of Ahalyā in the VR UK version of the story Crit. ed. 7.30 –33. This is represented as the primordial act of sexual violence which, once committed, would henceforth be common among men. Indra is also cursed in this passage to be captured in battle (by Indrajit) and to lose permanent lordship of the gods.

Also, note that the daughter of Uśanas, raped by Daṇḍa at VR 7.71.15 is named Arajā, not Arā.
