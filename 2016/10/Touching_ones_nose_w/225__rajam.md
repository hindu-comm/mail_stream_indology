Not sure if it would help, but there’s a reference in Old Tamil literature to women’s gossip around town about a woman’s relationship with a man. The reference is “mūkkin ucci cuṭṭu viral cērtti (மூக்கின் உச்சி சுட்டுவிரல் சேர்த்தி). Women talk about the relationship between an unmarried woman and a man, and their gesture is indicated by ‘touching the tip of their nose with their index finger.’

Recently, when I was watching a music event on YouTube where Prince Rama Varma was teaching a group of students he touched the tip of his nose with his index finger, perhaps to express ‘shame shame’ or something like that. I’d have to search for that video again.

So I guess it was a practice in the south.

Regards,
rajam

I do not have my Hindi Muhavara Kosh with me now, but I have heard the idiom being used in Hindi to convey a feminine gesture of embarrassment, bashfulness, or no longer being able to remain angry [at somebody or something] upon realizing something.
