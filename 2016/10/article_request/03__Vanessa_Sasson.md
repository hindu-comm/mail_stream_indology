Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have a pdf copy of the following article:

Csoma de Koros, Alexander. "Notices on the Life of Shakya Extracted from the Tibetan Authorities."

The article is from 1839 and was originally published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (I believe) but a reprint was produced in the journal, Tibetan Studies, in 1986.

I cannot seem to find either edition.

Thank you,
Vanessa R. Sasson
