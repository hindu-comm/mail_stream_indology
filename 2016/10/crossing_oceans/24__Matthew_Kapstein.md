Dear Dominik,

When does the ban on ocean travel first appear? And when and how did it become the norm?
Ocean travel is often mentioned in Buddhist texts (e.g. BaverujAtaka) and the extension of
Indian civilization throughout SE Asia during the first millennium required Brahmans to journey
as well.

The theme of "India and the Sea" perhaps requires further inquiry -- or am I merely ignorant
of a great mass of research laying, so to speak, submerged?

best,
Matthew
