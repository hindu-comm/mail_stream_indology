I am referring here only the textual reference of the symbolism of the phrase of crossing ocean which is recorded in Nirukta (2.10): samudra (sam+ud+dru: waters flow up) or (sam+abhi+dru waters flow towards it) is understood as the passage between earth and heaven. One may find the detail explanation of the same under Nirukta 2.10.

 Subject: [INDOLOGY] crossing oceans?


Why is half the religious literature of early India concerned with "crossing the ocean of saṃsāra," when crossing a real ocean was forbidden for twice-born members of society? Why thatmetaphor in particular? 
Crossing fords, rivers, etc., makes metaphorical sense, and was allowed. But oceans?
