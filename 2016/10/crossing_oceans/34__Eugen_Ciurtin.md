Dear Colleagues,

Max Müller has an anecdotic reply from 1899, reporting in fact the
visits of Indians to Paris in the 1840s, when he was a pupil of Burnouf:

My Indian friend Dvarkanath Tagore, though not learned, was very
intelligent, and a man of the world. He rather looked down on the Brahmans,
and when I asked him whether he would have to perform penance, or
Prayascitta, after his return to India, he laughed and said, "No. I am all
this time feeding a large number of Brahmans at home, and that is quite
penance enough!" The real penance was, of course, the Pancagavya, the five
products of the cow which the penitent had to swallow before he could
be readmitted to his caste; and these products were not only milk, sour
milk, and clarified butter, but likewise other products, such as Mutra and
Gomaya. That penance still exists, and many of our Indian visitors have had
to undergo it after their return, though at present the five products of the
cow are reduced to infinitesimal proportions and swallowed in the shape of
a gilded pill.

*Auld lang syne*, Second series: My Indian friends, London: Scribner, 1899,
p. 12.

With every good wish,
