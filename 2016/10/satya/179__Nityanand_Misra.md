A member asked offline why there is no ‘jaśtva’ (‘t’ to ‘d’ change) by
‘jhalāṃ jaśo’nte’ (A. 8.2.39) in sat + ya = satya, unlike in cases like
sat + yukti = sadyukti
sat + yoga = sadyoga

I am copying the answer here too. The reason is that due to ‘yaci bham’ (A
1.4.18), ‘sat’ in ‘sat + ya’ is not a ‘pada’ but a ‘bha’. This is why
‘jhalāṃ jaśo’nte’ is not applicable. ‘yaci bham’ does not apply in
‘sadyukti’, ‘sadyoga’, etc.
