My turn to ask :-)

Has anybody scanned

AUTHOR: KOLATTERI SANKARA MENON
TITLE: BHADANTA NAGARJUNA'S RASA VAISESHIKA SUTRA WITH THE COMMENTARY OF
NARASIMHA
DATE:
​1928 or ​
1976 (reprint)
NOTES: http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863593175

​I've checked DLI, archive.org, scribd, etc.  And it's not available in
Canada through inter-library loan or purchase.

Many thanks either way,
Dominik Wujastyk​
