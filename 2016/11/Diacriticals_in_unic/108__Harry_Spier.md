Dear list members,

In unicode you can write characters with diacriticals with either a single
glyph or you can combine the character with the diacritical writing it in
two glyphs.

This is a problem when one searchs sanskrit etexts.

For example, the letters with diacriticals in the Muktabodha digital
library are written with one glyph and as far as I can see GRETIL does the
same thing.  But the transcoding utility at  "The Sanskrit Library"
http://sanskritlibrary.org/transcodeText.html
combines letters with their diacriticals in two glyphs.
 So if you used the Sanskrit Library utility to create a transliterated
word such as for example: *śākti* and then searched texts from either
GRETIL or Muktabodha for that word your search wouldn't find anything.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
