Dear list members,

The TITUS database http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/indexe.htm
\has many sanskrit e-texts not available elsewhere.  But many of the
e-texts on TITUS are marked "restricted download".

Does anyone know what the requirements are to get permission to download
these e-texts.

Many thanks,
Harry Sjpier
