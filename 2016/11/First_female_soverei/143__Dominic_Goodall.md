Do widowed queens who continued as regents after their husbands’ deaths not count?

Surely there must be a few of these from much earlier periods. Prabhāvatī Guptā is one.  Another from further afield might be Kulaprabhāvatī, known from a fifth-century Cambodian inscription that seems to have been composed after her husband’s death (K. 875, Journal of the Greater India Society IV, p.117).

I think she also briefly ascended to the throne prior to this, as well, again according to Kalha.na. She is also known from the numismatic evidence; Cunningham records exemplars of her coinage, which was heavily alloyed.
