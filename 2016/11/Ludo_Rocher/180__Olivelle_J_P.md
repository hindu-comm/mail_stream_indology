Dear Friends:

I just received the news from Rosane Rocher, that our teacher and friend, Ludo Rocher, passed away last night peacefully. I am sure we will have a more detailed tribute to him, but he was not just a great scholar but a humble and loving teacher and friend. 

With best wishes,

Patrick Olivelle
