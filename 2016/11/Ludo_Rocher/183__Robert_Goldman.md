I am saddened to learn of Ludoâ€™s passing. He was my teacher and my dissertation supervisor. He was a deeply learned and generous scholar and a gentleman of teh odl school. He will be sorely missed by his many friends, colleagues and former students.

He loved my daughters and was like a grand father to them, during Manjushree's visit to Philadelphia.  Shubhangi and I visited him and Rosane at his home in Philadelphia a few years ago, and experienced the continued warmth of his affection.  He was a true Guru to me.  May he rest in peace.  I have attached photo of Ludo and Rosane with his students.
