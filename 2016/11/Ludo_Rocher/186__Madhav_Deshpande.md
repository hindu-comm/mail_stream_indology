Patrick asked me to write some Sanskrit verses about Ludo Rocher.  Here are
a few:

ल्यूडो-रोशे-स्मरणम्


बेल्जम्-देशसमुद्भूतो बन्धुप्रेमपुरस्थितम् ।

पुण्यशीलान्वयाख्यं यो विद्यालयमुपागत: ।।

संस्कृताध्यापनं कुर्वन् शिष्याणामुपकारक: ।

शिष्येषु पितृवत् प्रेम दर्शयन् सार्वकालिकम् ।।

विद्यादाने नित्यरत: सर्वविद्याविचक्षण: ।

ल्यूडो रोशे इति ख्यातो गुरुरस्माकमुत्तम: ।।

चिरकालं ज्ञानदानं कृत्वा सफलजीवित: ।

गतोऽधुना देवलोकं स्मरामस्तं दिने दिने ।।

यस्य स्मरणमात्रेण शिष्याणां जायते शुभम् ।

स राजतां चिरतरं चन्द्रमा इव नो गुरु: ।।


बन्धुप्रेमपुर = Philadelphia, City of Brotherly Love

पुण्यशीलान्वय = Pennsylvania
