Dear members of the List,

I'd be most grateful for a pdf of the following essay:

Sontheimer, G. D. 1994. ‘The Vana and the Kṣetra: The Tribal Background of
Some Famous Cults.’ In G. C. Tripathy and H. Kulke (eds), *Religion and
Society in Eastern India*: 117–64. Delhi: Manohar Publishers.

With many thanks in advance,

Chiara Policardi
