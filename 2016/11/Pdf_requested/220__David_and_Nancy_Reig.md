Dear Ken,

There are many copies of this book available on addall.com, under their
used books (some of which are new copies). This is a helpful site, because
it gathers data on availability from the many bookseller sites around the
world, in one convenient place.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
