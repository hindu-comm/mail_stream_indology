AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGE PROCESS IN THE GURU-DISCIPLE RELATIONSHIP.
(VOLUMES I AND II) by GLICK, STEPHEN Ph.D., Temple University, 1983, 582
pages; AAT 8311643)

http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2013-January/037493.html

There could be many many more.

I remember a conference announcement on the Indologist itself, on the
concept of Guru.
