 Dr.Klebanov,

               Thank you for your reference. However,Harshacharita , by Bana, is more of an Eulogy on the 

life and incidents of King Harsha,rather than being on a historical context. As against 

that,VikramankaDevCharita,( Authour-Bilhana) composed at least century ahead of Rajtarangini, in the 11th 

century, contains substantiated historical details on the  time ans society prevailing during Emperor 

VikramaDitya's era.





                                                    ALAKENDU DAS
