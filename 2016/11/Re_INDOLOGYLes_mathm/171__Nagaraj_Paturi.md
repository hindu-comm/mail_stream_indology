Looking at the use of a good word in a wrong context, it is not proper to
avoid the use of the same good word in the right context. In order to show
what can justifiably called 'Vedic Mathematics', books such as your well
researched one should be called 'Vedic Mathematics' books only.

Congratulations!

Looking more such works from you.
