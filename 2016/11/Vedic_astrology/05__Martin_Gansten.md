Just to clarify (since I was the one to mention the recent origins of 
the term as used today): what is new, and to the best of my knowledge 
began in North America, is the use of 'Vedic astrology' to describe the 
Indian version of horoscopic astrology, or horāśāstra. I may be wrong, 
of course, but I have never seen any publication by an Indian 
practitioner prior to the 1990s referring to his (or, occasionally, her) 
art using that phrase, whereas today it is rampant.
