Hi Martin,

"Also, of course, Dagmar's reference to āyurveda, though I don't think
anyone has yet decided to call that system 'Vedic medicine' (or have
they?)."

So, in fact, the Maharishi people do call their medicine (and everything
else they do, including astrology) Vedic. That is, they call medicine
Maharishi Ayurved, and it's trademarked, but they insist it's Vedic.
