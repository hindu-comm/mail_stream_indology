Dear Colleagues,

Some of you may already be aware of the project by Peter Adamson and
Jonardon Ganeri to present “The History of Philosophy *without any gaps*
<http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/>” online in a series of podcasts.
Recently, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Peter Adamson in
setting up an episode on philosophical yoga, which was just published
online here <http://www.historyofphilosophy.net/yoga-maas>. I hope that you
may find this as well as the other episodes of “The History of
Philosophy *without
any gaps*” useful for general information and teaching purposes.



Best wishes,



Philipp Maas
