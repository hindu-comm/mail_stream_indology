The Afterword by Richard Davis in The Archaeology of Bhakti II: Royal Bhakti, Local Bhakti edited by Emmanuel Francis and Charlotte Schmid, IFP and EFEO, Pondicherry, 2016 may be useful in this connection. Here is an excerpt.

“In light of this diversity of forms of bhakti portrayed in classical Indic texts, it seems wise to abandon the attempt to identify a single point of historical origin for bhakti.  Instead, we might adapt the archeological method of the chorological classification.  Within the same chronological period, we find a variety of types (in this case, varieties of devotional religion), fulfilling the same function, which for the archeologist points to a divergence of traditions involving distinct groups (in this case, different religious communities).  In our case, the difference is not a geographical one, as it usually is for archeologists, but a matter of differing religious commitments.  How does bhakti manifest itself differently within different religious communities, directing themselves towards different recipients?”

The concept of emotional bhakti (as opposed to intellectual bhakti) a la F. Hardy has been traced to the poetry of Aḻvars and Nāyaṉmars till now. However, in a paper I presented in 2015, I argue that the beginning of emotional bhakti can be traced all the way back to the Clssical Tamil poetry.

The Srivaishnavas took the first-millennium hymns of the Divyaprabandham and made them the “Tamil Veda.” I’m not sure exactly when this happened, but probably about the 10th or 11th millennium CE. The poems themselves describe how moving they are when sung, but unfortunately in order to stress their “Vedic” status, they came to be recited like the Vedas, mechanically and without the music, which must have been quite beautiful. When recited in front of a deity, certain phonemes (I forget exactly which ones) are changed to softer phonemes lest the reciter inadvertently pollute the deity. Recitation of the Divyaprabandham is part of the worship in many Vaishnava temples in the south, and its words are considered on a par with those of the Vedas. The Divyaprabandham itself, which dates to the first millennium CE, goes to great lengths to identify Vishnu worship with the Vedas. George

The word is quite often used in the sense of 'belonging to the lineage of the cultural/textual complex of which the Vedas are (of course, vital) part. From the insider's point of view , Vaidika is Veda- aviruddha, Veda-anuroopa, Veda-anusaari etc. not necessarily Vedochcharita/Vedas'ruta.
