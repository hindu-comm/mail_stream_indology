One might add that with the Āḻvārs (Divyaprabandham) and the Śaiva Nāyaṉmārs, there is a strong emphasis on temple worship and of the actual presence of the deity in the temple. The importance of the temple is perhaps the distinguishing innovation of the bhakti worship in the Tamil area that subsequently spread north. The Tamil bhakti poets modeled their behavior after that of the earlier Sangam poets, who would go from the court of one king to another singing poems of praise and receiving gifts. Subsequently, Vishnu and Śiva were identified with kings (the Tamil word for temple is kōyil and means “king’s house”) and the bhakti poets would go from one temple to another singing the manifestation of Viṣṇu or Śiva there. The Divyaprabandham says again and again that Tirumāḷ (Viṣṇu) is equally in Vaikuṇṭha, in the particular temple the poet is visiting or singing about, and the heart of the devotee. Most of the major temples described 1500 years ago are still there, and in Sangam literature itself, almost 2000 years ago, we find some temples to Murugan (Paḻaṉi, Tiruccentūr) that are still extremely popular. We have bhakti poems in Sangam literature (the Paripāṭal, Tirumurukāṟṟuppaṭai) probably centuries earlier than the Aḻvārs and Nāyaṉmārs, as Palaniappan has pointed out (see his post). George

Later, this idea of approximating the Lord becomes central to Yoga in Patañjali’s Yoga Sūtra  as Īśvara praṇidhāna. Ramanuja carries on this theme by identifying bhakti as a kind of jñāna but further a kind of upāsana, which evokes images of meditation but also offerings to sacrificial fires. This serves to highlight a continuity of a theme stretching back to the early Vedas of the approximation of a deity via Vedic themes of sacrifice. 
> 
> What shifts  from the early to the later period is that in the early mantra period worshiping a deity was motivated by desire for outcomes—a practice that is consequentialist as consequentialism is the view that right procedure is justified by a good outcome. What happens by the time of the Upaniṣads is that consequentialism starts to be viewed with suspicion because, as Yama himself describes in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad, those who are geared towards outcomes do not take control of their life and this results in ruin. So what we see happening is a switch to a radical procedural ethics, that treats practice as defined by a regulative ideal, the Lord, and the worship or approximation of this ideal as resulting in the good. It is superficially like consequentialism but it is contrary. This radical proceeduralism is Yoga, or Bhakti. The main difference is that Yoga or Bhakti is a causal story of how the right brings about the good and is the opposite of Virtue Ethics that claims that the good character brings about the right action. Bhakti/Yoga rather claims that the right practice is defined by the ideal of the right (the Lord) and perfecting this practice is the good.  Consequentialism in contrast is an account not of moral causation but justification.  
> 
> So while the ideas that the bhakti tradition rely upon are ancient, and not implausibly described as Vedic, it is true that there is a radical shift that characterizes the latter part of the Vedic tradition starting with the Upaniṣads. We see this transition from consequentialism to a radical proceeduralism of bhakti as a theme of the Gītā , for instance. I think it also explains why Brahman as development comes to occupy a central place in later Vedic thought.
