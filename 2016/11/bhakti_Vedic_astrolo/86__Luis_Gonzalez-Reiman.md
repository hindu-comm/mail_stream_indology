Correction:

The end of the last line should say /Yavana Jātaka/, not /Yāvana Jataka/.

There is also sidereal astrology in the " West," so that is not really a 
good marker of the difference. Also, at the time of Greek influence on 
Indian astronomy the two zodiacs more or less coincided, so there was no 
difference between sidereal and tropical (this applies to both 
Indian/South Asian astrology and to "Mediterranean" astrology). The date 
of when that happened will depend of exactly where one considers the 
beginning of Aries (the constellation) to be.

Horoscopic astrology was mainly imported into India and then adapted, as 
shown by the /Yāvana Jataka/.
