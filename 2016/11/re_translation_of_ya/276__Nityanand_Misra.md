*PW: f. nom. act. von 1. yaj P. 3,3,110, Sch. wohl fehlerhaft für iṣṭi. *
*pw: f. nom. act. von 1. yaj. Richtig iṣṭi. *

Does *f. nom. act. von 1. yaj* (saying that a word is an abstract noun from
a specific root) not indicate/suggest a meaning? If it did not hint at the
meaning of *sacrificing/sacrifice*, how did the Monier-Williams dictionary
entries, supposedly based on the above entries, end up as the following?
Did M-W get the meaning from another source?

*MW: sacrificing, (perhaps incorrect for 3. ishṭi.)*
*mw: sacrificing, Pāṇ. iii. 3, 110, Sch. (prob. w. r. for ishṭi)*
