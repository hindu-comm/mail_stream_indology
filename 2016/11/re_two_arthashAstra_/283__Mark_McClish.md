Dear Arlo,

I believe those references are to the Arthaśāstra commentaries Jayamaṅgalā and Cāṇakyaṭīkā. The Cākṣuṣīya is supposed to be an independent work.

I have since found the following entry in Singh’s Bibliography of Kautiliya Arthasastra:

459. Ramakrishna, Kavi, M. "Caksusiya." Journal of Sri Venkatesvara Oriental Institute, Vol. 4, Part 1, 1943, pp. 123-128, Vol. 6, Part 2, pp. 33-53.

460. Ramakrishna, Kavi, M. " Chakshushiya: an ancient work on Arthasastra." Annals of Sri Venkatesvara Oriental Institute, Vol. 1, part 4, 1940, pp. 79-89.

Does anyone know where these might be available online?

All best,
Mark

Dear Mark,

Could the second item be the one whose accurate bibliography is elaborately stated in n. 49 of von Hinüber's 2005 article on bhūmicchidranyāya <http://www.jstor.org/stable/43382108<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.jstor.org_stable_43382108&d=CwMF_w&c=yHlS04HhBraes5BQ9ueu5zKhE7rtNXt_d012z2PA6ws&r=0VMy4AVIL7ZKIaC4sH1Pm49PWgKJk0KFb86IpzVGC5E&m=NNmM5LkoQZ2u-iubFrAi6y-J9gCAZzg-hP1VasMcmBw&s=7l0EE4Ma2FHT1PbQYkraYLyyc1ovF3C0u3eS5liGHBs&e=>>?

Subject: [INDOLOGY] two arthaśāstra sources

Dear friends,

I’m having trouble locating two sources on arthaśāstra, and I hoped someone on the list might be able to help me. I give here the bibliographic information as I have it.

1. Ruben, W. 1929. Study in the Arthaśāstra. Dharwar. (This is cited in Sternbach’s Bibliography of Kauṭilya Arthaśāstra, which has a number of errors, as well as, at least, Botto’s article on dvaidhībhāva in India Maior). Worldcat has the following, but I couldn’t get it from the British Library to see if it is the same:

2. Kavi, Ramakrishna. [title unknown: multiple articles on and text of the Cākṣuṣīya Arthaśāstra]. Journal of the Venkatesvara Oriental Institute. 1:79-89; 3:99-116; 4:123-128; 4:129-140; 6:129-140(?). This comes from Kane I p. 152ff.

With thanks in advance for any help hunting down any of these.

All best,
Mark
