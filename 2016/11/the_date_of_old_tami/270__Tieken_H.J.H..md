Dear List members,

This is to let you know that I have written an article about David Shulman's attempt to date Caṅkam poetry in his recent book Tamil. A Biography (Massachusetts 2016). By way of experiment I have placed a pdf of the article directly on my website (go to "publications", then to "Articles").
The title of the article is:

"Myth versus concocted empiricist histories.
David Shulman's reconstruction of the history of Tamil Caṅkam poetry".

With the best wishes, Herman
