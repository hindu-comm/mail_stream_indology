Dear Colleagues,

It is with great pleasure that I announce the completed digitization of the Index Catalogue of MSS. Chandra Shum Shere by T. Gambier Parry. Revised and Completed by E. H. Johnston. This small project was made possible by a generous grant from the Max Müller Memorial Fund. I would like to acknowledge the fundamental help of Dr Gillian Evison and of Prof. Christopher Minkowski in securing the grant.

The PDF files are available on the Finding Aids - Oriental Manuscripts & Rare Books: South and Inner Asia webpage of the Oxford LibGuides website (http://libguides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/c.php?g=422971&p=2888532). They are listed under the section Sanskrit (see also Indic, above). I have prepared a set of three different files:


·         Index Catalogue of MSS. Chandra Shum Shere vol. 1 (A-Tarpaṇa)

·         Index Catalogue of MSS. Chandra Shum Shere vol. 2 (Tarpaṇa-Muktāvalī)

·         Index Catalogue of MSS. Chandra Shum Shere vol. 3 (Muktāvalī-Haumikaprāyaścitta-Modern Indian Languages)

Each file is available in two different resolutions: the first for fast internet connections and fit for printing, the second for slower internet connections and to be displayed on screen. All files are provided with bookmarks for easy navigation.

I hope that this low-tech solution will nevertheless help all manuscript lovers to find their way through the thousands of manuscripts in this valuable collection.

Merry Christmas!
