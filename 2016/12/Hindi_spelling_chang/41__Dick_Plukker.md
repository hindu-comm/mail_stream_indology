Dear Harry Spier,

I am afraid I don’t know the Manak Hindi grammar book you mentioned, but 
the most recent (2016) publication (in Hindi) of the Central Hindi 
Directorate (of the Ministry of Human Resource Development), 
/Standardization of Devanagari Script and Hindi Spelling/, says on p. 
30, par. 3.13 (on the euphonic glides ya and va) that in cases where the 
use of ya is optional (jhukāye or jhukāe) the spelling with the glide is 
to be avoided. The same rule was formulated in earlier publications of 
the Directorate, already in the sixties of the previous century.

It is not a spelling reform, but rather an attempt from the side of the 
government to standardize the spelling of Hindi.

The booklet can be downloaded for free at:

Yours,

Dick Plukker
