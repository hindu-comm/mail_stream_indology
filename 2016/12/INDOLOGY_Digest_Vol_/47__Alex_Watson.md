Dear Dominik

See pp. 74–80 of Jonathan Bader's *Meditation in Śaṅkara's Vedānta*.
There he
- contrasts *prasaṅkhyāna* with the almost synonymous term *pratisaṅkhyāna*
(famously the topic of the third chapter of Śaṅkara's *Upadeśasāhasrī*)
and
- discusses the use of the term *prasaṃkhyāna* in classical Yoga, Advaita
Vedānta and Kālidāsa.

*khyāti* in *sattvapuruṣānyatākhyāti* of course has a different sense from
that which it has in the *khyātivāda* that Matthew was speaking of:
erroneous cognition in the latter, correct cognition/discernment in the
former.
