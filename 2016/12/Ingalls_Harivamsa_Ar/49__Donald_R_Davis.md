Dear Colleagues,

Our library’s copy of the Mélanges d'indianisme à la mémoire de Louis Renou (1968) is lost and I would like to get a copy of Daniel Ingalls’ article “The Harivamsa as a Mahakavya,” pp.381-94.  Any chance a good soul on the list has a copy to send to me privately?

Thanks in advance,

Don Davis
