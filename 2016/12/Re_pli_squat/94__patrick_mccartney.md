Thanks Nagaraj. I know that *arrai mandi* is not Sanskrit, and that it also
doesn't 1:1 match the position or movement of the plié squat. Might you be
able to offer a more appropriate Sanskrit term for this dance-like plié
position? I've been looking in yogāsana encyclopedias and websites and not
found anything even close, apart from mālāsana
<http://www.yogajournal.com/article/beginners/learn-malasana/>, which is
nothing like a plié squat.
