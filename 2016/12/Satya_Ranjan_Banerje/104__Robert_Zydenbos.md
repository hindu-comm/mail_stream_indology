Very sad indeed. I first met Prof. Banerjee on my very first trip to India, in early 1979, and knew him as an enthusiastic scholar of a kind and helping nature.

Perhaps it should also be remembered here that after the passing away of Ganesh Lalwani, Prof. Banerjee took over the duty of editing the Jain Journal from Calcutta. I, too, will miss him dearly.
