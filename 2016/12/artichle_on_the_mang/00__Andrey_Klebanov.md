Dear members of the list, 

I would be very thankful if anyone would be able to share a pdf of the following article (mentioned in Minkowski’s contribution to the Śāstrārambha-volume):
V. Varadhachari “A note on the maṅgalavāda of the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika school”, Adyar Library Bulletin 26 (1962) 28-35
As far as I could see, the concerned volume of the bulletin is lacking from the DLI.

In fact, I would be most thankful for any further bibliographic reference to the above topic as well. 

thanks a lot in advance, 

Andrey
