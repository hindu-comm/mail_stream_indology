Dear Friends,
I thought that I had posted the attached to my Academia.edu page, but it
may be that I put it up for review; I don't well understand these things.
In any event, in case anyone might be interested in the book I published
from the Harvard Oriental Series, the attached errata are important. I had
sought to have the press include the errata sheet in the volume itself, but
I can't determine whether that worked out or not, so I send it here, and I
will attempt again to post it to my Academia page.
Many thanks, Jonathan
