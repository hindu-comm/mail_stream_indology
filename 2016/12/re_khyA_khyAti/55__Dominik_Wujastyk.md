Me too.  ​I would also be interested in any studies of the presumably
related term *prasaṅkhyāna* (= "*sattvapuruṣānyatākhyāti*" PYŚ) that is a
keyword in the *Pātañjalayogaśāstra*. ​ I am aware of

Endo, K. Mayeda, S.; Matsunami, Y.; Tokunaga, M. & Marui, H. *(Eds.)
"*Prasaṃkhyāna
in the Yogabhāṣya" in *The Way to Liberation: Indological Studies in Japan,*
Manohar Publishers & Distributors, 2000, 75-89.


​Best,
Dominik​
