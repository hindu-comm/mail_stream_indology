 To ALL,



              A very very happy new year to All.





   In the Vaishisheka parlance, Abhava ( i.e.negation) has been classified as- Prag-Abhav, 

Dhangsh-Abhava and Attyanta-Abhava.



           Can anybody suggest an example  of Attyanta Abhava.?





                                                ALAKENDU DAS.
