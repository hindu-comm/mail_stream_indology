Generally vandhyāsūtas and śaśṛṅgas are examples of what the 
Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika philosophers refer to as "aprasiddha" terms, i.e. terms 
that have no established object-correlate in the real world. In 
Navya-Nyāya texts, the term atyanta(abhāva) is used to describe the 
temporal extension of an absence but not its spatial extension (i.e. the 
extent of its occurrence in real-world objects), hence Ingalls and 
others translate it as "constant absence". In theory, anything (apart 
from kevalānvayin properties and perhaps other special types of 
properties or entities) could be the counterpositive of a constant 
absence at least in a particular location or set of locations. The 
Nyāyakośa defines it as : yad vastu yatra na kadāpi bhaviṣyati na ca 
kadācid bhūtaṃ tasya vastunas tatrātyantābhāvo mantavyaḥ | yathā vāyau 
rūpaṃ nāstīti pratītisākṣiko 'bhāvaḥ |

So an example could be the constant absence of colour in the wind.

Best regards,

Michael Williams
