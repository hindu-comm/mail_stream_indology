 Dr.Williams,



                    Thank you for your explanation. I,too, am aware of the fact that colour of 

Wind is a befitting example of Attyanta Abhava. 



                                                  However, in course of my Vedanta Philosophy 

studies ,I got stuck over a particular issue. Does the statement' The pot does not exist in this 

plane'(BHUTALE GHATA NASTI") can be taken as an example of AttantyaAbvhava? I am a bit sceptical  

on this issue. AttantyaAbhava means something which has a constant multidimensional absence ( 

Trikaala Badhita). The absence of Pot in This plane may not necessarily mean it's absence in 

other planes too. 

                      In spite of this, can it be taken as an example of AttyantaAbhava.?



                                                          ALAKENDU DAS
