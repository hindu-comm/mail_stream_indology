My impression is that the categorisation of absence that becomes 
standard in the Navya‐Nyāya tradition (i.e. the twofold division of 
absence into mutual absence and relational absence, with relational 
absence divided into prāg‐, pradhvaṃsa‐ and atyanta‐ abhāva) is first 
found in Vācaspati Miśra's I Nyāyavārttikatātparyaṭīkā under sūtra 
2.2.12. Not all earlier Nyāya‐Vaiśeṣika philosophers accept this scheme 
of absence. An early Vaiśeṣika thinker to accept the same scheme of 
absence is Śivāditya in the early passages of the Saptapadārthī. Matilal 
(in the Navya‐Nyāya Doctrine of Negation, chapter 12) has a good 
discussion of the historical development of the concept in pre‐Gaṅgeśa 
Nyāya‐Vaiśeṣika philosophy. The standard manuals of Navya‐Nyāya (e.g. 
Siddhāntamuktāvalī or Tarkasaṅgraha and their commentaries) have 
detailed summaries of the concepts. Another good source is Stephen 
Phillip's translation of Gaṅgeśa's Tattvacintāmaṇi.
