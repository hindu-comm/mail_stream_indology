Just to add to this: the category of atyantābhāva also occurs in
*Candramati's *Daśapadārthaśāstra, a Vaiśeṣika work preserved only in
Chinese translation (see Ui, "The Vaiśeṣika Philosophy according to the
Daśapadārtha-Śāstra", London 1917). *Candramati also accepts abhāva as a
separate category (padārtha). His text lists five varieties of absence
(the other four are prāg-, pradhvaṃsa-, anyonya-, and saṃsarga-abhāva).
Prior to Vācaspati Miśra I, Bhaṭṭa Jayanta relates the fourfold
classification at NM I 166,7f. (Mysore ed.), and then also a sixfold
classification (these four plus apekṣābhāvaḥ and sāmarthyābhāvaḥ).

The fourfold classification also occurs, of course, in Kumārila's
Ślokavārttika, chapter on abhāva, where the example for the atyantābhāva
is the hare's horn. There it is however not part of an overarching
classification into the two types mutual and relational absence.

With best wishes,
