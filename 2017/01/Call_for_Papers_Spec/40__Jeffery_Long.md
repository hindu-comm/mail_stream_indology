Dear Colleagues,



The link in the Call for Papers that Icirculated yesterday makes reference to a fee for processing ofsubmissions. There will be no fee in thecase of this special issue. In mytwenty-year career, I have yet to pay to publish anything. I don’t plan to start now, nor do I expect itfrom any of you!



All the best,

Jeff

Ihave recently been invited to guest edit a special issue of the journalReligionson the topic of reincarnation/rebirth. I would like to invite any of you who are interested to contribute an article. The due date is July 31, 2017. The topic can be approached from any perspective (analysis of a particular text or tradition, theological or philosophical reflection, social scientific analysis–the more the merrier).
