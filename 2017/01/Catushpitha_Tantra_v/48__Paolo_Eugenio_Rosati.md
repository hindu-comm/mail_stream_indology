Dear indologists,

I am struggling with the "chronology" regarding the *catushpitha*s concept
and its first appearance in the Vajrayana cosmos.

Particularly, the *Catushpitha Tantra *described a list of four *pitha*s
linked to philosophical concepts---*atman pitha*, *para pitha*, *yoga pitha
*and *guhya pitha *(cit.
in D.C. Sircar [*The Shakta Pithas*] 1948, 11).
Regarding this text, the only clue that I found is that one of its
commentaries was copied in 1145 CE (ibid.).
While I found no discussion about the original text, and particularly if it
was previous or coeval with the *Hevajra Tantra* (that could be date
between seventh and middle of eighth centuries)---althoug from Sircar study
I argued he considered the two tantras to be more or less coeval.

I wish someone can help me with some reference to the *Catushpitha Tantra.*

Best wishes,
Paolo
