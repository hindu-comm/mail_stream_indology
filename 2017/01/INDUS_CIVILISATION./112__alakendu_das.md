 To All,



      While going through some books on Indus valley civilisation , I failed to find out one 

answer. Though the Harappana & Mohenjo daro script has been inferred as more of a Hieroglyphic 

type, what dialect/language  did they speak ? 

Would love  to be enlightened on this point.





                                                         ALAKEND DAS.
