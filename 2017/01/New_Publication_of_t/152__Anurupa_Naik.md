The /Avacchedakatānirukti/, a supplement by Gadādhara Bhaṭṭācārya (circa 
1604–1709) to the commentary /Dīdhiti/ on the /Tattva Cintāmaṇi /written 
by the great philosopher Raghunātha Śiromaṇi (circa 1477–1547), deals 
with the interpretation of /avacchedakatva/, the individuality of 
invariable concomitance in inference (/vyāpti/), elaborating upon 
Raghunātha Śiromaṇi’s treatment of the topic. In his own commentary, the 
/Subodhā/, Prof. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya clarifies the most difficult 
portion of this śāstric text, and renders it accessible by presenting it 
in simple and lucid language.
