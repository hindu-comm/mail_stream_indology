Madhav,

The same mode of expression is very common in inscriptions to indicate in which branch of the Veda a person was trained: X-sabrahmacārin.

Best wishes for the new year,

Tim

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re: a question regarding the usage of -gotra versus -sagotra

To add more of a grammatical note, a term like viśvāmitra-gotra in Sanskrit can have two possible meanings: a) the gotra of viśvāmitra (a Tatpuruṣa compound), and b) one whose gotra is viśvāmitra (a Bahuvrīhi compound).  On the other hand, the term viśvāmitra-sagotra is more clear in having only one meaning: "one who has the same gotra as viśvāmitra."  This may be the reason why the passages quoted by Professor Korada prescribe the use of -sagotra expression.  In my family rituals, the declaration included something like aham bhāradvāja-gotrotpannaḥ ... "I, born in the bhāradvāja-gotra."  In this usage, the term bhāradvāja-gotra is used just to refer to the gotra of bhāradvāja, and not in the sense of "one with the bhāradvāja-gotra."   I don't remember the usage of bhāradvāja-sagotra in my family.  In any case, thanks for all the suggestions, and I have communicated these to my friend, who posed the original question to me.

Thank you Professor Korada for the references that indicate that -sagotra should be added to all Gotra references.  The variation in actual usage may simply be due to people not following this rule.

all gotras should be added sa
bhaardhvaaj sagotra etc.
 Charudeva Shastry uses it every where. This rule is said in Grhya sutra etc, I don't remember right now. I will send reference later. But every gotra is added sa and not only few.

Dear colleagues,

     I am forwarding a question from a friend of mine, for which I do not have a clear answer:

Dear Madhav,

I thought you might have a quick answer to this question. When mentioning gotras, one sees "Visvāmitra gotra", but also "Ātreyasa gotra", and "Kāsyapasa gotra".

Since the ṛṣis in the two latter cases are Atri and Kasyapa, it would appear that the corresponding gotras should be "Ātreya" and "Kāsyapa", without the "sa" suffix. (Indeed, one also sees "Ātreya gotra", and "Kāsyapa gotra".)

Is it the case that the correct terms are "Ātreya sagotra", and "Kāsyapa sagotra", and the conventional usage is simply an incorrect parsing? However, this would require "Visvāmitra sagotra", which one does not see.

Or is there something more to it than that?

Unquote

Why would someone be referred to as Viśvāmitra-gotra, but others as Ātreya-sagotra or Kāśyapa-sagotra?  I will appreciate a clarification.
