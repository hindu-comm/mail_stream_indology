Dear list members,

Happy new year.

There is a Rudra gayatri in a text in the Muktabodha digital library called
parākramapūjā as follows:

ṣaḍananāya vidmahe
citrapādāya dhīmahi
tan no rudra pracodayāt

1) Why  ṣaḍananāya ?  Is there a form of Shiva with 6 faces?
2) How would  citrapāda be translated in this context?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
