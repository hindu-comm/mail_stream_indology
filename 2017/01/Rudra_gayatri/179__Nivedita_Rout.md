We may find the reference of six headed Siva (Bhadresvara) from the inscription of Champa (Myson stone slab inscription of Jaya Indravarman II, dated 1088 AD).

 Subject: [INDOLOGY] Rudra gayatri

Dear list members,
Happy new year.
There is a Rudra gayatri in a text in the Muktabodha digital library called parākramapūjā as follows:
ṣaḍananāyavidmahe 
citrapādāyadhīmahitanno rudra pracodayāt
1) Whyṣaḍananāya ? Is there a form of Shiva with 6 faces?
2) How wouldcitrapāda be translated in this context?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
