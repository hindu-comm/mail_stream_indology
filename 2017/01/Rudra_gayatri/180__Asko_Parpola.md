The six-faced god is Skanda, the Hindu successor of Vedic Rudra, who developed six mouths/faces to be nurtured by the six krttikas, the maidens of the Pleiades who were bathing in the heavenly Ganga when Siva's/Agni's seed fell there and instantly became a beautiful baby.

Best regards, "Asok"

> There is a Rudra gayatri in a text in the Muktabodha digital library called parākramapūjā as follows:
> 
> ṣaḍananāya vidmahe 
> citrapādāya dhīmahi 
> tan no rudra pracodayāt
> 
> 1) Why  ṣaḍananāya ?  Is there a form of Shiva with 6 faces?  
> 2) How would  citrapāda be translated in this context? 
> 
> Thanks,
