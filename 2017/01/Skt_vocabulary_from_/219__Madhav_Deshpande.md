Just as an aside, terms like mudrā/mudraṇa in the sense of printing became
common and entered Sanskrit usage from their vernacular usage.  In Marathi,
typographic errors resulting in some comic meaning were often referred to
as the joke of a Mudrārākṣasa (मुद्राराक्षसाचा विनोद), where the word
Mudrārākṣasa is used in an entirely new meaning.  Most of the terms listed
by Dominic are part of Marathi usage.  It would be worth investigating the
earliest occurrences of these neologisms.
