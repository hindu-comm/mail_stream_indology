Dear List Members, 

Can anyone advise me as to the textual source of the following Rabindranath Tagore quote?

"If you cry because the sun has gone out of your life, your tears will prevent you from seeing the stars."

I would like to get the original Bengali text of the line/verse, if possible. 

Many thanks in advance, 

Chris Gibbons
