I just became aware of the 1959 article in Poona Orientalist describing 39
manuscripts and listing 253 further titles from the Waray (वारे) family's
personal collection of 3000 MSS.  I've uploaded this to
catalogues.indology.info (Biswas 1074).

The article above by G. S. Waray says it's part I.  As far as I can see
from a quite net search, and from Pingree's CESS bibliographies, no more of
this description was published.

What happened to the Waray collection?  Is it still with the family in
Pune?  Donated to an institution like VSM or BORI?

Best wishes,
Dominik
