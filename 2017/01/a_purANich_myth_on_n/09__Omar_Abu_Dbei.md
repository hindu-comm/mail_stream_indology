Dear Professors and Collegues,


my name is Omar Abu Dbei and I am currently a PhD student under the
supervision of Raffaele Torella in Rome.
While consulting Vettam Mani’s  *Purāṇic Encyclopaedia*, I have found a
reference, under the entry *Urvaśī *(pp. 812-813), to a mythical episode
that might be, under many respects, of the greatest interest for my
research:

*Once Agastya went to the durbar of Indra. On the occasion Indra asked
Urvaśī to dance. In the midst of the dance she saw Jayanta, the son of
Indra, and became amorous and her steps went wrong. Nārada who was playing
his famous lute called Mahatī could not play well. Agastya went angry and
cursed Jayanta to become a bud. He cursed Nārada also. So his lute became
the lute of the world. Urvaśī was born on the earth under the name Mādhavī
due to the curse*.



Unfortunately, no Sanskrit source is recorded and, not being a specialist
myself in the field of *Purāṇa*s, I have been unable so far to find any
possible one. Is there anybody who knows the exact source of this myth?


Many thanks for your attention.


Kind regards,


Omar Abu Dbei
