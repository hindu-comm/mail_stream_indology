Dear colleagues,

I am looking for two articles that I am hoping someone here may have access to. I am not sure that I have the bibliographic reference right (they came to me from someone else), but they are as follows:

Bhikkhuni Badhra (2001). "Higher Ordination and the Bhikkhuni Order in Sri Lanka," Dehiwala, Sri Lanka.

Bhikkhuni Badhra (2002). "Higher Ordination that leads to the Eradication of the Defilements," World Fellowship of Buddhists Review 34.

With gratitude,

Vanessa R. Sasson
