My verse on Rāma/Rāvaṇa this snowy Ann Arbor morning:

“साध्वीं मामपहृत्य दण्डकवनात् पापं कृतं रेऽधम

तस्मात्त्वं पतितोऽसि, याहि नरकं“ सीताब्रवीद्रावणम् ।

तज्जानन्नपि जानकीसुवचनं रामो रणे पातयन्

लङ्काधीशमरावपि श्रितकृपस्तं स्वर्गलोकं ददौ ।।

"By abducting me, a righteous wife, from the Daṇḍaka forest, you, Wicked,
committed a sin.  Therefore, you are fallen.  Go to hell."  Sītā said to
Rāvaṇa.  Even knowing those good words of Sītā, while felling Rāvaṇa the
Lord of Laṅkā on the battlefield, Rāma, who was compassionate even to his
enemy, sent him to heaven.
