Dear Colleagues,

     I have access to Ganganath Jha's translations of Kumārila's
Ślokavārttika and Tantravārttika.  Kumārila's Ṭupṭīkā comments on Jaimini's
Mīmāṃsāsūtras beginning with the 4th Adhyāya to the end, but I have not
seen Jha's translation of this commentary.  Was such a translation ever
published by Jha?  Any info would be useful to me.  Thanks.
