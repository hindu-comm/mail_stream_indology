Dear list members,

I’m pleased to announce the publication by Aditya Prakashan (New Delhi) of the second edition of my monograph Dharma Pātañjala: A Śaiva Scripture from Ancient Java, Studied in the Light of Related Sanskrit and Old Javanese Texts. This is a thoroughly revised and corrected edition, but its principal merit is, perhaps, the price-tag of 3000 rupees (around 40 euros, as opposed to the 180 euros of the Egbert Forsten/Brill edition).

Potential buyers may order it directly from the publisher’s website: <http://www.adityaprakashan.com/index.php?p=sr&Field=isbn&Exactly=yes&Format=detail&String=9788177421675 <http://www.adityaprakashan.com/index.php?p=sr&Field=isbn&Exactly=yes&Format=detail&String=9788177421675>>. They are reliable and ship anywhere in the world. The book is also available on Amazon.com <http://amazon.com/>, but it carries a slightly higher price-tag.

Best regards,
