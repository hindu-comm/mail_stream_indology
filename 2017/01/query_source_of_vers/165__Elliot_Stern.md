Dear list members,

rṣiputraparameśvaraḥ I (a 14th century CE Kerala scholar)  cites these verses and verse portions while commenting on vācaaspati’s treatment of a Buddhist critique satkāryavādaḥ in nyāyakaṇikā. He cites them in explanation of terms in sāṅkhakārikā 7:

atidūrātsāmīpyādindriyaghātānmanonavasthānāt |
saukṣmyādvyavadhānādabhidhānādabhibhavātsamānābhihārācca ||

Each verse or verse portion appears separately in svaditaṅkaraṇī.  He may have cited them from different works, or he may have cited them from the same work, but not in the order that they appear in the original.

Can any list members  identify any of these? 

ātmendriyamanaḥsvārthasaṃyogā jñānahetavaḥ |
siddhāstadbhāvabhāvaitvāttaddoṣa jñānadūṣaṇāḥ ||

ajñānaprabhavādharmarāgadveṣadibhirmalaiḥ |
tatrātmā dūṣyate

tathā timirabādhiryapittakuṣṭhāvakartanaiḥ |
dūṣṭanetrādināsāntaṃ mithyājñānasya kāraṇam ||

kṣutpiāsāmadonmādalobhamohādibhirmanaḥ |

saukṣmyapraviralībhāvacalatvasadṛśādibhiḥ |

atyāsannātidūratvavyavadhānāidibhistathā |
samprayogopi dūṣṭaḥ sanmithyājñānopapādakaḥ ||

Years ago, I spent many hours skimming through books and their indices looking for sources for these and other verses. I found nothing quite like these. More recent Google and online document searches for these have also yielded nothing.

Thank you in advance.
