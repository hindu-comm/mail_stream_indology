Dear colleagues on the INDOLOGY list,

We have a software problem that is causing members to be unsubscribed in a
manner that seems random.  This has happened to a dozen or so people, I
think.

We're working actively to track down the problem and solve it.  Kindly be
patient in the meantime.  And in particular, if you receive a message
saying "you have been unsubscribed from the INDOLOGY list" please don't
take it personally :-)   It's just the faulty software talking.

Best wishes, and apologies,
The INDOLOGY committee
