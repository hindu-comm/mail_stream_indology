Dear list members,

An unfortunate accident in my copy of the Madras University Sanskrit Series No. 24 edition of Bṛhatī of Prabhākara Miśra,, volume 3, containing adhyāya 1 pādas 2,3,4 and adhyāya 2 complete makes part of pages 409 and 410 unreadable. I’m hoping a list member can provide a scan of these pages (or a scan of the entire volume).

Thank you.
