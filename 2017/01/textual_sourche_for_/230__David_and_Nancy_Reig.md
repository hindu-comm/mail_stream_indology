Has anyone seen the Sanskrit term nirvāṇa-mastaka in use? It appears in *A
Dictionary in Sanscrit and English*, by H. H. Wilson, 2nd ed., 1832 (not in
his 1st ed., 1819), defined simply as "liberation." From there it was
copied in the Petersburg Wörterbuch (defined as Erlösung) and in the
Monier-Williams dictionary (defined as liberation, deliverance), both of
which give only Wilson as their source for this term. It is not in the
*Śabda-kalpa-druma*, but is in the *Vācaspatyam*, defined as: nirvāṇam nirvṛtir
mastakam iva yatra. Various searches by me have so far failed to turn up
this term in a Sanskrit text. Hoping that one of you has seen it in use and
can give a textual source for it.

Best regards,
