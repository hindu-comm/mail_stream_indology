we are happy to announce that, at the end of 2016, two new issues of the Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies have been uploaded at our new main location, Cross-Asia Journals at Heidelberg.

Vol. 23, 2 is an extensive  paper by Doris Srinivasan, dealing with the vexed question of the Kuṣāṇa time deity Oešo and his relation with Śiva.

Vol. 23,3 by Marcos Albino deals with a difficult passage in the Maitrāyaṇi Saṃhitā.
