Dear listmembers,
there is one episode in the Vessantara-Jātaka which describes the 
following plot:

...After Vessantara gave away the two horses of his coach, Sakka advised 
four junior gods
to pull Vessantara's coach. They appeared in the guise of a red deer....

Some murals which depict this plot show four horses instead of the red deer.
As the only textual source I found one edition of the Butsarana with 
aśvaveśa (for mṛgaveśa).
All Pali and further Sinhala sources read mṛgaveśa.

I suppose there is a northern tradition which records aśvaveśa (Gilgit, 
Tibetan or Chinese).

Anyone came across this version and is willing to share this with me?

Thank you in advance

Heiner
