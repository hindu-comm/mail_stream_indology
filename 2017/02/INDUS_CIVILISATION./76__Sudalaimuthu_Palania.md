There is an interview of Asko Parpola published recently in the Swarajya Magazine website. See https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/the-indus-jigsaw-can-it-be-pieced-together-at-least-partially <https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/the-indus-jigsaw-can-it-be-pieced-together-at-least-partially>. The interview is titled, â€œThe Indus jigsaw: Can it be pieced together, at least partially? For any reason, if you are unable to access it, here is a site where it was published earlier, http://www.sutrajournal.com/asko-parpola-on-the-roots-of-hinduism-by-vikram-zutshi <http://www.sutrajournal.com/asko-parpola-on-the-roots-of-hinduism-by-vikram-zutshi>.

Regards,
Palaniappan
