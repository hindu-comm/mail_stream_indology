In an astrological text I have come across several instances of the 
compounds /dhṛtastrī/ and /dhṛtabhāryā/, which are new to me and which I 
have been unable to find in dictionaries. From the context it seems 
possible that the phrases could refer to a mistress, quite literally a 
'kept woman'. Can anyone confirm or correct this suspicion?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
