https://github.com/aupasana/ashtadhyayi/tree/master/tattvabodhini
has tattvabodhinI commentary for all pAdas except 6.2

It seems that the source from which the data was derived lacked 6.2, as can
be seen from discussion at https://github.com/aupasana/ashtadhyayi/issues/2.

I would be grateful if some scholar whose copy has this missing 6.2 pAda
can send it across.

Best regards,
