Dear Adriano,

I concur with Matthew’s recommendation. Mahendra Kumār Jain’s editions are meticulously edited and his doxographic annotations are invaluable.  Luigi Suali’s edition is far less reliable. I am elated to see that  his edition of this commentary now readily available. I searched in vain for it  a few years ago.

Best regards,

Elliot
