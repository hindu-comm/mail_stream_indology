Dear Allen,

     At least in the Marathi speaking area, words like granthālaya and
granthapāla have by now been defined as replacements for English "library"
and "librarian".  My father used to teach a course in Granthapālanaśāstra
referring to Library Science in Pune.  Similarly, the word Prakāśana and
Prakāśaka have come to refer to Publishing and Publisher, while Sampādana
and Sampādaka have come to refer to editing and editor.  It is possible to
see some fluctuation in the usage of these terms in the 18th and 19th
centuries, but over time, these words have become fixed in Marathi usage
with definite meanings.
