That is also true for Sanskrit works published with Hindi translations,
commentaries, or paratexts. Bhāṣābhāṣya usually refers to something like an
expanded translation, and this usage of the term actually dates to the
seventeenth century. Bhāṣāṭīkā is more like a commentary proper; however,
these terms are often used interchangeably in contemporary publications.

And of course, no edition would be complete without a śuddhipatra
(erratum/corrigenda).

Best,
Tyler
