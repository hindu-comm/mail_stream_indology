Dear list members,
I am looking for a scan of Trivandrum Sanskrit Series Volume 150 (part 3 of
Sucaritamiśra’s Kāśika on the Ślokavārttika). It looks like Prof. Deshpande
answered this same query in April 2016 with a WeTransfer link for the
volume, but it has now expired. If anyone has a newer link, I would
appreciate it.

Best,
Malcolm
