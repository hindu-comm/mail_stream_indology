Dear list members,

Following the excellent conference held in Kraków last year (http://www.ydys.confer.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/about), our colleagues at the Jagiellonian University have organised a 2-week intensive Yoga Studies Summer School. This would be of great interest to any student (or indeed anyone) studying or researching any aspect of yoga, or with an interest in sanskrit yoga texts and traditions.

Please note the following deadline:

YSSS application submission: 31st March 2017

I transmit below some information from one of the organisers.

With best regards

Elizabeth De Michelis
