Dear Friends,

I would humbly appreciate input from those who have taught these subjects
to advise what would be a suitable reading material (Sanskrit),
supplementary reference material and course layout for a student who has
completed already 4 years of university Sanskrit so has a competent reading
and grammar capability and would like to do a semester of caraka and one of
pāṇini.

With Kindest Wishes,

Martin Gluckman
