Dear Omar,

Besides Vettam Mani’s  *Purāṇic Encyclopaedia*, there is another purāṇa
reference work: *The Purana Index*, by V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar, 3
volumes, University of Madras, 1951-1955 (reprinted by Motilal Banarsidass
in 1995). It covers only five purāṇas, which it regarded as the most
ancient: Vāyu, Brahmāṇḍa, Matsya, Viṣṇu, and Bhāgavata. For the particular
Urvaśī episode that you inquired about, under Urvaśī, it gives as source
Matsya-purāṇa 24.12-33. It utilized the 1907 Ānandāśrama edition of the
Matsya-purāṇa.

The 1916 English translation of *The Matsya Puranam*, made by "A Taluqdar
of Oudh," published in 2 parts as volume 17 of The Sacred Books of the
Hindus series, does not state what Sanskrit edition it was made from.
However, the above-given reference to 24.12-33 is right for this episode in
it. My impression is that this is a rather loose translation of the Matsya-
purāṇa. A new English translation of the *Matsya Mah**ā**purā**ṇa* by "A
Board of Scholars" was published by Parimal Publications in 2007.

We unfortunately do not yet have a critical edition of the Matsya-purāṇa.
One was undertaken by V. Raghavan shortly after the inception of the
All-India Kashiraj Trust, and he published articles on it in their *P**urā*
*ṇa* journal starting with vol. 1 in 1959. Although he published "A Sample
Edition of the Matsya Purāṇa" in vol. 4, 1962, neither he nor others ever
completed this edition. Thus, we do not know if some Matsya-purāṇa
manuscripts have variant readings for the characters in this Urvaśī episode.
While Vettam Mani’s account has Agastya giving the curse, the Ānandāśrama
edition of the Matsya-purāṇa has Bharata giving the curse.

Best regards,
