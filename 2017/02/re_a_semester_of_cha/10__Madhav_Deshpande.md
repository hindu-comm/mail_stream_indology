Dear Martin,

     For a one semester introduction to Pāṇini, I would suggest that you
use an abridged version of Pāṇini like the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī.  For
general readings on Pāṇini, I find the first Introductory volume of Rama
Nath Sharma's translation of the Aṣṭādhyāyī very useful and readable,
supplemented by a selection of readable articles on Pāṇini.
