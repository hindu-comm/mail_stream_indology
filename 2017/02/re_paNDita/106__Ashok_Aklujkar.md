Much relevant material can be found in: The Pandit. Traditional Sanskrit Scholarship in India. Festschrift Parameshvara Aithal.  (ed) Michaels, Axel. New Delhi: Manohar. South Asian Studies series.

I have contributed an article to this volume which may be considered directly relevant to your query: 
	"Paṇḍita and pandits in history.”   

The second article in the same volume which indirectly explains how the uses noted so far on this thread become possible is: "The pandits from a piṇḍa-brahmāṇḍa point of view.”

a.a.
