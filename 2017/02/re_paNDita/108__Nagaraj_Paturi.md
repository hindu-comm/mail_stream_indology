पण्डिताः is used in three different meanings in the following three verses
in Gita:


गतासूनगतासून्श्च नानुशोचन्ति पण्डिताः ॥ 2\-11॥


विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।

शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः ॥ 5\-18॥


साण्‍ख्ययोगौ पृ‍इथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः ।

एकमप्यास्थितः सम्यगुभयोर्विन्दते फलम्।ह् ॥ 5\-4॥


In the first, Arjuna is being called Pandita and he is being told that it
is not appropriate for Arjuna to lament.


But in the second, Pandita is almost equivalent of sthitaprajna, a person
with the highest level of spiritual attainment as per the book.


In the third, it is in contrast with baalaah.
