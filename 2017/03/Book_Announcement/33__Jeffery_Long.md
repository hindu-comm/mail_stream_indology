Dear Colleagues,
I am very pleased to announce the publication of the two-volume set,Buddhism and Jainism, edited by K.T.S. Sarao and myself. These two volumes are part of the much largerEncyclopedia of Indian Religions, edited by Arvind Sharma and published by Springer.
The volumes are quite expensive. Please have your libraries order them!
All the best,JeffDr. Jeffery D. Long
