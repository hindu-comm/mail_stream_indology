Dear colleagues,

I am trying to find a reliable date for Buddhasvamin's 
Brihatkathashlokasamgraha. Lacote has placed it, quite tentatively, in the 
8./9. c. CE. Although Winternitz was not happy with the way Lacote came to 
this conclusion, this date seems to be used by most later scholars writing 
on the subject (e.g., Maten).

Is there any fresh evidence regarding his date? Perhaps even an earlier one?

Best, Oliver
