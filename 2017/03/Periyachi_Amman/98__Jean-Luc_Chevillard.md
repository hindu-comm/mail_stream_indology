Greetings from Paris,

I see that there is a Tamil Wikipedia page about her.

https://ta.wikipedia.org/s/5q3t

which is not linked with the English Wikipedia page

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periyachi

Some people have also discussed பெரியாச்சி in the mailing list called மின்தமிழ்

SEE:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/minTamil/%E0%AE%AA%E0%AF%86%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%9A%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF;context-place=topic/minTamil/I5E4wSrmAww

There are 17 hits

I hope that helps a little

If you do find songs, I would be interested in seeing pointers
