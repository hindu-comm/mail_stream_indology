Several versions of the legend exist in New Persian also, named
"Belawhar va Būdāsaf" or "Blawhar wa Būzasf", see e.g. the entry in the
Encyclopaedia Iranica (which does not include later versions in New
Persian, however)

Maybe the entry by D. M. Lang in the Encyclopaedia of Islam could also
be helpful:

Lang, D.M., “Bilawhar Wa-Yūdāsaf”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second
Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van
Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.

The Blawhar wa Būzasf by ´Alī Ibn Muḥammad Niẓām Tabrīzī (14th century)
was printed by Mirath-i Maktub, Tehran 2002.
