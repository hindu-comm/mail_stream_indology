Dear Patrick,
A belated and probably superfluous reaction. Yesterday I happened to read Nick Allen, "The Hanging Man and Indo-European Mythology", in Parallels and Comparisons. Proceedings of the Fourth Dubrovnik Intern. Conf. on the Skt Epics and Puranas, Zagreb 2009, pp. 89ff), and then I remembered your request. On p. 101 Allen writes: The situation is quite different from the parable of Barlam and Iosaphat, where (say) the Middle English version and Chavanne's Chinese version are immediately recognisable as being the same story as Vidura's". Allen's article, which is about Vidura's story on a man hanging face down above a pit,, opens with a quotation from Barlam and Iosapath.

Onderwerp: Re: [INDOLOGY] Query

Several versions of the legend exist in New Persian also, named
"Belawhar va Būdāsaf" or "Blawhar wa Būzasf", see e.g. the entry in the
Encyclopaedia Iranica (which does not include later versions in New
Persian, however)

Maybe the entry by D. M. Lang in the Encyclopaedia of Islam could also
be helpful:

Lang, D.M., “Bilawhar Wa-Yūdāsaf”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second
Edition, Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van
Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.

http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_COM_0120

The Blawhar wa Būzasf by ´Alī Ibn Muḥammad Niẓām Tabrīzī (14th century)
was printed by Mirath-i Maktub, Tehran 2002.


Best,
