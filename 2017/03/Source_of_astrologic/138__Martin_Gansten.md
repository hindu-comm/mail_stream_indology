I am looking for the source of an astrological stanza in svāgatā metre, 
relating to the prediction of death and containing (probably beginning 
with) the line /krūrakhecaradaśāsamaye ca/. It is quoted by Balahadra 
simply as 'jātakokta', suggesting that it derives from a major or 
well-known work, but I have been unable to locate it in the sources I 
have consulted so far (the Bṛhatsaṃhitā, Bṛhajjātaka, Laghujātaka, 
Jātakakarmapaddhati/Śrīpatipaddhati and Sārāvalī). If anyone should 
recognize it, or have any ideas as to likely sources, I'd be glad to know.
