Dear list members,

further to my earlier communication about the YSSS (organisers' invitation repeated below) I wanted to let any interested parties know that a bursary announcement and a call for volunteer helpers has been added to the YSSS's website page. Also a reminder that the deadline for sending applications is 31 March 2017.

With best regards, 

Elizabeth De Michelis
