I wonder if list members might throw any light on the term alpamṛtyu 
occurring in a 17th-century Sanskrit text (Yādava's 
/Tājikayogasudhānidhi/). I would have supposed it to be a scribal error 
for apamṛtyu (in the sense of 'untimely death') were it not that the 
metre requires that the first syllable be long. I do not recall seeing 
the word in other Sanskrit texts, but a quick web search returns quite a 
number of hits in the vernaculars, including some from the 
Rāmcaritmānas. However, I am not sure from these whether to understand 
alpamṛtyu as untimely death (= akālamṛtyu), as a nearly but not quite 
fatal accident, either, or as something else entirely.
