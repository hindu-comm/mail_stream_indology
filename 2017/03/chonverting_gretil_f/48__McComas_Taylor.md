Dear Colleagues


I am looking for a digital edition of the critical edition of the Viṣṇupurāṇa in devanāgarī. The closest I can get are the texts of the ViP that Peter Schreiner has generously input and which are available on Gretil in CSX, REE and UTF-8 formats.


Is there a way of converting these formats to Devanāgarī?  I have found a utility on John Smith's site which looks good, ur2ud, but my Norton security software won't let me run it and deletes it as security threat.


Any advice gratefully received


McComas
