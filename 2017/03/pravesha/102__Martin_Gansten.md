Nothing to do with possession, etc., but like Nagaraj, I thought of 
/gṛhapraveśa/, and also of /varṣapraveśa/, which is the (Tājika) 
astrological term for what is traditionally called the revolution of the 
year in English (and /taḥwīl as-sana/ in Arabic, which was the language 
of the Tājika source texts) -- that is, the moment at which the sun 
returns to the zodiacal position it occupied at a person's birth, and 
for which a new horoscope is cast to determine his or her prospects for 
the coming year.
