This is NOT AT ALL an answer to the original query,
but the occurrence of the expression "One's Own Language" in this 
discussion brings back to my mind one of the etymologies
which I have seen SEVERAL TIMES given for the word தமிழ் [tamiḻ],
explained as a contraction of "தம்மொழி" [tam moḻi = "one's language"]

Those who can read Tamil
can see that POINT OF VIEW
stated for instance inside the following link (dated 30/09/2005):
