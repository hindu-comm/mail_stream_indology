Dear McComas,


You can use an browser-based conversion tool like this one: 
http://www.learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript


Since the IAST romanized file has spaces in between some words that 
would be printed together in Devanagari, the result is not perfect.  
Nevertheless, it does the job for the most part and can convert the 
whole file at once.  You just copy and paste all the text into the text 
box on the website.


All the best,


Michael
