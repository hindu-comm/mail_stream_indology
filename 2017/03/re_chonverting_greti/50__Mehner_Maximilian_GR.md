Dear McComas,

on a side note (as I get the question about conversion a lot), many if not most of GRETILs texts are available at www.sanskritworld.in<http://www.sanskritworld.in> converted to nāgarī. The Viṣṇupurāṇa however is not the version contributed by Peter Schreiner and blanks are sometimes unconventional in those files, too.

Best wishes,
Max

Dear McComas,


You can use an browser-based conversion tool like this one:  http://www.learnsanskrit.org/tools/sanscript


Since the IAST romanized file has spaces in between some words that would be printed together in Devanagari, the result is not perfect.  Nevertheless, it does the job for the most part and can convert the whole file at once.  You just copy and paste all the text into the text box on the website.


All the best,


Michael

Dear Colleagues


I am looking for a digital edition of the critical edition of the Viṣṇupurāṇa in devanāgarī. The closest I can get are the texts of the ViP that Peter Schreiner has generously input and which are available on Gretil in CSX, REE and UTF-8 formats.


Is there a way of converting these formats to Devanāgarī?  I have found a utility on John Smith's site which looks good, ur2ud, but my Norton security software won't let me run it and deletes it as security threat.


Any advice gratefully received


McComas
