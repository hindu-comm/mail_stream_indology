Dear David,
Mille grazie! Due to bad back problems I have not been able to to go to the library to get the article. 
I think Professor Smith's interpretation is very convincing. Smith has written about heresies earlier: see "The Early Heresies in the Development of Indian Religion"
in Indologica Taurinensia 2 (1974, 149-198, "Addendum to the Early Heresies" Indologica Taurinensia 5 (1977) , 177-178.
Best regards to all
Stella
P.S. For an (almost) complete bibliography of Professor Smith's many (very original) publications see Corolla Torontonensis. Studies in 
Honour of Ronald Morton Smith, edited by Emmet Robbins and Stella Sandahl, TSAR publications Toronto 1994, pp.xiii-xix.
