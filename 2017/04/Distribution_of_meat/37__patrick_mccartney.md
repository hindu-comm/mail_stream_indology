Dear Friends,

A yoga teacher friend of mine asked me recently about the distribution of
meat during such events as Kali puja. Are there scriptural prescriptions
based on social hierarchies of purity and proximity regarding the
distribution of the butchered meat? Are some parts of the goat or buffalo
preferred? If so, why? Are some groups denied certain parts of the animal?
Is there a gendered component?

Thanks in advance.

Patrick
