I am sure, most of you must be aware of the female name ending bāī /bāyī/
bāy /bā found in many contemporary northern particularly north-western
languages.

Pingree's version is possibly bāī >vāī, such a phonetic change b<>v being
quite common many Indian languages.

The bhāī version could possibly be a hyperstandardization or scribal error.
