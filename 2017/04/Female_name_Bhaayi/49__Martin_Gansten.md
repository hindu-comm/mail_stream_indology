Yes, this was one of the first thoughts to strike me. But /śrībhāyi/ is 
used consistently at the end of each of the sixteen chapters; the -i is 
short, and surely the variation v<>bh is not very common, at least 
outside Bengal? (This is not my area of expertise, so I'm open to 
correction.) Also, if /bhāyi/ is to be understood as a suffix, Śrī would 
have to be the mother's personal name. Not impossible, of course, but 
perhaps unusual?

Perhaps that is why Pingree homed in on it (though he explicitly says 
that Yādava lived in Gujarat).* It may have been one of his 
over-confident emendations. But even reading /vā[y]i/ för /bhāyi/ and 
/supure/ for /suṣuve/, the /-nāmni/ will be unmetrical and the first two 
pādas won't hang together, so I do think his suggested reading must be 
abandoned.
