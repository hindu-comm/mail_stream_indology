But in this case, neither of the two MSS I have been able to examine so 
far supports any of these readings. One consistently has /bhāyi/, at 
least 17 times; the other alternates between /bhāyi/ and /bhāi/. There 
is no b/v and no long ī. Therefore I am hesitant to accept this as a 
variant of the /bāī/ suffix.
