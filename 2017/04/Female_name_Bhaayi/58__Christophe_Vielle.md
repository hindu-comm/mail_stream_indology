For an example of Malayalam (and I suppose Sanskrit) writing bhāyi for what is transcribed in English "Bayi"

It is not a scribal error. It is a variant pronunciation sincerely represented consistently.

But it must be conceded that he was somewhat prone to rash emendations and far-reaching interpretations. In recent years, Bill Mak has shown the problems with some of Pingree's work on theYavanajātaka; and in another linguistic field (but still related to astrology), Stephan Heilen in his Hadriani genitura (De Gruyter 2015) similarly has some reservations about Pingree's edition of Hephaestio'sApotelesmatics. I am not competent to judge Pingree's work on texts in any language but Sanskrit, but there I do quite often find reason to disagree with his readings and/or translations. It would be interesting to learn from an Arabist what the situation is with his work in that area.

>> It was not unusual to write the non-Sanskrit words as one heard them or as the metre required; approximation was acceptable. Therefore the writing of (our expected) bāī as bhāyī or bhāyi need not be viewed as presenting a serious problem. (again. cf. Paturi: “Shortening of the end vowel is not a hurdle …”)

They all read bhāyi or bhāi -- I have not so far seen a single instance lacking the aspiration. That was what made me wonder in the first place.
