Gentlemen,

for an evaluation of Mislav Jezic's analysis of layers in the Bhagavadgītā,
see:

Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee, "Paradigm Lost: The Application of the
Historical-Critical Method to the Bhagavadgītā," *International Journal of
Hindu Studies *20, no. 2 (2016): 199–301.

The article is uploaded here:
https://www.academia.edu/30431442/Paradigm_Lost

See especially the table on pages 259–261. The proposed criteria for
identifying historical layers in the Gītā do not work; and unless we can
provide new criteria or arguments, we are recirculating old and discredited
literature. Brockington's arguments in "The Bhagavadgītā: Text and
Context,” in Lipner, ed., 28–47 are also addressed in the article; we show
his claims are reliant on Georg von Simson's work, and he does not propose
any arguments.

The reasons for the interest in different versions of the Gītā are
addressed here:

We discuss the untenability of the oral bardic epic hypothesis in our
forthcoming book *Philology and Criticism: A Guide to Mahābhārata Textual
Criticism*. It should be in print in two months or so; I will announce it
here as soon as it is out.
