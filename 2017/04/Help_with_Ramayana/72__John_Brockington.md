See my /Righteous Rāma: the evolution of an epic/ (Delhi: OUP, 1985): 
185-7. The passage begins: "The question of writing in the Rāmāuaṇa has 
been extensively discussed, especially with regard to its bearing on the 
date of the poem.  There are in fact very few references in the text but 
these are all to marking objects with a name, [refs in fn.] not to the 
use of writing for extended documents of whatever type.  The better 
known are the two mentions of the ring marked with his own name which 
Rāma gives to Hanumān as a token for Sītā (4.43.11 and 5.34.2)."

The Critical Edition published at Baroda is simply the most suitable 
text for scholarly purposes, being based on a rasonably wide sample of 
manuscripts and compiled on text-critical principles (almost entirely 
adhered to).
