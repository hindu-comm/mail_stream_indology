Have you got a complete unicode compliant font installed on your machine?  (Most non-ancient computers do now.)  Some individuals still use non-Unicode fonts, which will not display properly if you do not have the same installed.  Does it always happen?  Example?

But it may also be your mail interface.  My Outlook mailer, for example, will replace every macron-a (ā) with a question mark — only that letter, not ī, ū, etc. — unless I include an underdot (or overdot) character in the message as well.  For this reason, I include one in my signature, in case I forget.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Inability to see romanised (transliterated text with diacritics) Sanskrit in my emails.

Hi there,

I'm having difficulty in reading the transliterated (romanised Sanskrit with diacritical marks) in the Indology Digest. These appear as "?" in my email. Would you be able to suggest any setting changes or otherwise I could implement to be able to read the transliterated Sanskrit correctly?

Thank you for your help with this.

Best

AJ
