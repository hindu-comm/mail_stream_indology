Hello Jon,

Penn Libraries has a selection of illustrated mss if the Gita and Mbh that are freely available online either through the Penn in Han Selected Manuscripts site or through Openn. If you write me off list I can easily hook you up with something appropriate.

Best,
Ben Fleming

There are several illustrated Gītā and Pañcaratna manuscripts in the Wellcome Library's collection (wellcomelibrary.org<http://wellcomelibrary.org>, wellcomeimages.org<http://wellcomeimages.org>).  For details see the indexes of illustrations in the two vols. of my Handlist.  The library is academic-friendly, and may not even charge you for high-res OpenAccess images.

If memory serves, Ursula King made a study of Bhagavadgītā  MS images, many years ago. (found it: King, Ursula (1982). "The iconography of the Bhagavad Gita." Journal of Dharma 7 (2):146-163.)

Best,
Dominik

Hi,
I’m doing a research on miniature paintings in Bhagavad Gita manuscripts.
Does someone have any suggestions as to where I can find pictures taken from manuscripts since I assume it would be difficult to get direct access to relevant manuscripts?

Kind regards,
Jon Skarpeid
