Dear List members,

I would be most grateful for a pdf of the following article - I did not
meet with any success looking for it in the resources accessible to me:

Goldman, Robert P. “Vālmīki and Vyāsa: Their Contribution to India’s
Discourse on Ethnicity”. In *Journal of the Oriental Institute*, M.S.
University of Baroda 46, 1-2 (1996): 1-14.

With many thanks in advance,
Chiara Policardi
