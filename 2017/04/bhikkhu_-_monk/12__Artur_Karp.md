Dear List,



A problem – probably already solved, many times over, but - recurring, sort
of obstinate.



Now, in texts describing the first days after the Buddha’s Awakening there
appears term *bhikkhu* (*bhikkhave*) – usually translated as ‘monk’
(‘monks’).


The typical dictionary definition of the word ‘monk’ is: “man in a *religious
order* who lives a life of poverty, chastity and obedience”.



At that early period there was no Buddhist order, not yet. Prof. Stanisław
F. Michalski would use in his pre-war Polish translations the word ‘żebrak’
(‘almsman’, ‘beggar’). More appropriate, certainly, but sounding not too
well – considering the sort of, typically aggresive beggars appearing on
the streets all over the world.



‘Monk’ (‘monks’) seems to prevail, in Poland and everywhere else.


But, my students ask me: the first sermon and its addressees – a *group of
five monks* – had they been already made members of the *Buddhist order*?
When and how was that order established?


Respects,


Artur Karp (ret.)
