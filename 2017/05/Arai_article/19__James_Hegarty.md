Dear Colleagues,

I am looking to obtain, faster than inter-library loan, a copy of an article by Toshikazu Arai, which is entitled ‘Jaina Kingship in the Prabandhacintānmaṇi’ (in Richards’ Kingship and Authority in South Asia). I would be most grateful for a scan of it, if anyone has one.

Best Wishes,

James Hegarty
