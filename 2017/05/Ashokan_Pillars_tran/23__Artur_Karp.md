Dear List,

Has anyone studied - and written on - the mode of transport of AÅ›okan
pillars out of the quarry in Chunar, dst. Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh?

The Firoz Shah Kotla Pillar (brought by Firoz from Ambala dst., Haryana) is
a sandstone monolith nearly 13 m. in height, and it weighs close to 27
tons.

Regards,

Artur Karp (ret.)
