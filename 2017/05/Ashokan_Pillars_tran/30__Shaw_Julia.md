It is also on Researchgate.... so perhaps easiest to just request a full text version from the author.

Thank you, Julia.

But - a pity. The link does not lead to the paper, one gets a view of some selected fragments, nothing more. Pity - again.

But, anyway -

 getting the pillar out of the quarry, then - transporting it to the river, then - moving it onto a ship, then - getting it out of the ship, then - transporting it to the place of the final destination, then - setting it there --- a phantastically complicated technical/organizational enterprise.

Says much more about the AÅ›okan era than - I'd risk saying that - some enigmatic texts engraved on the pillar.

Best wishes,

Artur

Dear Artur

The recognitior of ancient stone quarries at chunar hills with dateble epigraphs was a startling discovery made by the author of this book, in the year 1990. the followup archaological field investigations around chunar and Varanasi, which were carried out between the years 1990 and 1994, have uncovered the entire process of stone carving which was prevalent during the historical period in the Ganga plains. Besides archaeological investigations, ethnological surveys were also carried out. As a result of which it has been possible, start from quarrying of stone carving process, start from quarrying of stone blocks, their transportation to the centres of utility-carving of the sculpturing centres and the main religious centres etc.



Best wishes, Julia

Dear List,

Has anyone studied - and written on - the mode of transport of A?okan
pillars out of the quarry in Chunar, dst. Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh?

The Firoz Shah Kotla Pillar (brought by Firoz from Ambala dst., Haryana) is
a sandstone monolith nearly 13 m. in height, and it weighs close to 27
tons.

Regards,

Artur Karp (ret.)
