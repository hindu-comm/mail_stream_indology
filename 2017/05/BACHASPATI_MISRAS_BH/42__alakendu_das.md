 Yes, this can be true, especially in the light of  yet another sutra  from his introductory 

preface to Bhamati. Here he speaks of Ten Abbayas ( may be attributes),namely 

Tapaha,Gyan,Kshama,Dhriti,Shrasrittwa,Atmasambodha etc. of Maheshwar or Lord Shiva.Here he offers 

his reverence for  the  Vedas  as well as Lord Shiva.  To qoute from 'Bhamati'- Shashwatay 

Namskurnami Vedaya cha Bhabaya cha.





                                                    ALAKENDU DAS.
