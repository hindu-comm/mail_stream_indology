But you seem to be saying that the Sanskrit manuscript is actually of a portion of a different Prajñāpradīpāvalī commentary, one by Jñānapāda? If so, does a Tibetan translation of it exist?

I'm still not quite sure, but chances are that this could be (a bit of) one of Jñānapāda's juvenilia, composed after his study with Haribhadra (whose influence is undeniable), when he was at Nālandā, before his (first) trip to the Konkan.
