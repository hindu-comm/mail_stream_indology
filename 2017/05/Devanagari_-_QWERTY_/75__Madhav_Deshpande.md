Dear Colleagues,

     I found a way of extracting the Devanagari - QWERTY.keylayout from
Apple's .bundle, and have been able to modify it with Ukelele to add
several characters that are missing in it.  Now I am able to enter: ऌ, ॠ, ॡ
, कॢ and नॄ with these modifications.  I have tried the Unicode signs for
Svarita and Anudātta markings.  However, the Anudātta marking overprints
the signs like ू, ृ and ु, and I have not yet found a solution of how to
get the Anudātta sign below these.  Any suggestions?
     Will keep on looking for solutions for these.

Madhav Deshpande
