Dear colleagues,

I am looking for contributors for the volume on Indian Philosophical
Theories of Religion: https://www.amazon.com/Bloomsbury-Research-
Philosophical-Handbooks-Philosophy/dp/147257365X (being published by
Bloomsbury).

I am also looking for contributions for the encyclopedia of Hinduism (being
published by Springer): http://www.springer.com/series/15157 Attached are
the unassigned topics that are still available.

Please respond *off-list* to these two requests for your kind contributions.

Thanks,

Pankaj
