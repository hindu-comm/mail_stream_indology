Dear colleagues,
could anyone help me scanning a few pages or giving place where the text is found. I would like to see what lies behind a rather obscure reference to V. Bhattacharyya, The Āgamaśāstra of Gauḍapāda (Calcutta 1943), pp. LXXII-LXXIV. The book is not found in any libraries here.

Best,
Klaus
