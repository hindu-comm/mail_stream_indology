Dear all,

does anyone happen to have a pdf of the following work?

Ramanatha Jha (ed.), Hariharaviracitā Suktimuktāvalī athavā Śrī-Hariharasubhāṣitam. With a foreword by Amaranatha Jha. Patna: Newspapers and Publications Ltd., 1949.

The volume is owned by a few libraries around the world (in Europe it seems that only the Universitätbibliothek Marburg has it), and it is not available from any major online bookseller.

Thank you very much in advance for your kind help,
with best wishes,

Marco
