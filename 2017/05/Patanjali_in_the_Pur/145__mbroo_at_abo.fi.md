Dear Colleagues,

In the preface to his interpretation of the Yoga-sutra (1889), the  
theosophist W.Q. Judge writes,

"About Patanjali's life very little, if anything, can be said. In the  
Rudra Jamala, the Vrihannandikes'wara and the Padma-Purana are some  
meager statements, more or less legendary, relating to his birth.  
Ilavrita-Varsha is said to have been his birthplace, his mother being  
Sati the wife of Angiras. The tradition runs that upon his birth he  
made known things past, present and future, showing the intellect and  
penetration of a sage while yet an infant. He is said to have married  
one Lolupa, whom he found in the hollow of a tree on the north of  
Sumeru, and thereafter to have lived to a great age. On one occasion,  
being insulted by the inhabitants of Bhotabhandra while he was engaged  
in religious austerities, he reduced them to ashes by fire from his  
mouth."

Has anyone located these or other similar stories of Patanjali?

Sincerely,
Måns Broo
