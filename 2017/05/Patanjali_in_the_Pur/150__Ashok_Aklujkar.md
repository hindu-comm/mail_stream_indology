Not taking the subject specification above rigidly, I would like to make three points:
(a) Even in studying stories one should try to ascertain if they pertain to Vyākaraṇa Patañjali, Yoga Patañjali or̄ Āyurveda Patañjali.
(b) The tradition of the identity of these three Patañjalis may be older than it is usually taken to be. 
(c) In three interlinked articles published in the book mentioned below, I have made a case for taking the Vyākaraṇa Patañjali as a person belonging to Kashmir. I have also pointed out that the epithet Gonardīya (<— Gonandīya) definitely applies to this Patañjali and that the epithet Goṇikā-putra may also contain historical information about him. Much history can be gleaned if the stories are cautiously handled.
