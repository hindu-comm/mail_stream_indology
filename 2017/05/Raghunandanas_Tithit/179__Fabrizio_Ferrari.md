Dear colleagues,



I’m trying to trace Raghunandana Bhaṭṭācāryya’s Tithitattva. So far no success. I found on DLI the second volume of his Smr̥titattva (edited by Jīvānanda Vidyāsāgara) (Kalikātā: Siddheśvara Press, 1865). Does anybody know whether the first volume (which includes, amongst the others, Tithitattva) is available in a digital format as well? If so, I’d be very thankful if you could point me in the right direction or, even better, if you had one copy to share.



With many thanks



Fabrizio
