Dear Colleagues,

     The राज्य मराठी विकास संस्था an organ of the government of the state
of Maharashtra has made 680 rare Marathi books and journals, many dating
back to 1820, available online in pdf form for free downloading.  This is
an absolutely amazing rare collection.  Here is a link to their home page:

     Try it, if you are interested.  With best wishes,

Madhav Deshpande
