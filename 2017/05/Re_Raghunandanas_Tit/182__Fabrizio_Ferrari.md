I found on DLI the second volume of his Smr̥titattva (edited by Jīvānanda Vidyāsāgara) (Kalikātā: Siddheśvara Press, 1865). Does anybody know whether the first volume (which includes, amongst the others, Tithitattva) is available in a digital format as well? If so, I’d be very thankful if you could point me in the right direction or, even better, if you had one copy to share.
