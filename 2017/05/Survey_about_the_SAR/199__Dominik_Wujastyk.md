If you have a few minutes - I mean not more than about 10 - it would help
me a lot if you would be so kind as to answer this questionnaire
<https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V9QGRGW> about the SARIT e-text library.
The purpose of the questionnaire is to see whether what SARIT offers is
actually what you, as an Indologist, want.  And if not, what features you
find good, bad, or would like to see added to the SARIT service.

This is a good chance for you to shape the future of SARIT!

Best, and with many thanks for any time you kindly spend on this,

Dominik Wujastyk
