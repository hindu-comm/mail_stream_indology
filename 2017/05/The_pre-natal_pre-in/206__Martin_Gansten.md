Regarding curses preceding incarnation, the following passage from 
Balabhadra's /Hāyanaratna/ (1649, /pace/ Pingree, who says 1629) seems 
to fit the bill:

* * * * *
hillājena tu brahmaviṣṇurudramukhanirgataśāpena yavanatāṃ prāptena 
śrīsūryeṇaiva yavanaśāstrapraṇayanād dvijānām api sūryasiddhāntavad 
etadadhyayanaṃ yuktam ity uktam |

    keśaviṣṇumukhanirgataśāpān mlecchatādhigatatigmamarīceḥ |
    romakeṇa puri labdham aśeṣaṃ tad dvijādibhir ato ’dhyayanīyam || iti |

puri romakapattane |

But Hillāja says [in /Hillājadīpikā /1.6] that because the Yavana 
science was founded by the illustrious  sun [god] himself, who had 
become a Yavana due to a curse issued from the mouths of Brahmā, Viṣṇu 
and Rudra, the study of this is proper even for the twice-born, like 
[the study of] the /Sūryasiddhānta/:

    Romaka received this whole [science] in the city from the sun [god],
    who, by a curse issued from the mouths of Brahmā, Śiva and Viṣṇu,
    had attained the state of a foreigner (/mleccha/); therefore, it is
    fit to be studied by the twice-born and others.

‘In the city’ [means] in the city of Rome.

For teachings at night, what about the Pāñcarātra?
