Hi,

Yes, there are many examples. One of the most striking, in my opinion, is the sage Viśravas’ pre-natal, even pre-conception, curse of Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Śūrpaṇakhā to be monstrous  because their mother-to be, Kaikasī, approached him at a bad time. The sage also  prenatally blesses his future son Vibhīṣaṇa to be virtuous. See the Vālmīki Rāmayaṇa (critical ed.) 7.9. 10–20.

Of course there innumerable examples of figures being cursed to suffer nasty future births.
