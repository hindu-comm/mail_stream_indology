Alf's example brings in a very good analogous narrative to that of
"sage Viśravas’
pre-natal, even pre-conception, curse of Rāvaṇa, Kumbhakarṇa and Śūrpaṇakhā
to be monstrous  because their mother-to be, Kaikasī, approached him at a
bad time."

Alf was cautious and said, " Vyasa's words (are they a curse?) "

Yes, that care is important even in the case of the sage Vis'ravas' words.
Are they a curse? Perhaps not.

In both the cases, a statement of the consequence of nishiddhakarma appears
to be a curse.
