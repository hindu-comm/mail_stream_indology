Dear List members,

I am looking for an edition of the Tamil text of the Thesawalamai (Tēcavaḻamai) compiled around 1707 in Jaffna, Ceylon. The Thesawalamai is a collection of the customs of the Tamils, which was to guide the Dutch administration in legal disputes. I am in particular interested in the Tamil terms for eighteenth-century Dutch legal terms. For that I need the Tamil text.
For the same reason I am curious to know if there exists an edition of the Tamil versions of the Dutch plakkaten in addition to the few published by Thananjayarajasingham.

With kind regards, Herman Tieken
