Dear Friends, One of my students is partially visually impaired and doing
some Bhagavadg카t훮 self-study over the summer. I gave him a very good scan
of the critical ed, but he's finding the font too grainy when he magnifies
it. With this in mind, does anyone know of a very well-printed--especially
one with large and bold script--ed of the G카t훮? Thanks,J
