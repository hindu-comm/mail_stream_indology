I am aware of Georg Bühler's
"Über Lineale oder "Faulenzer" zur Herstellung von Manuskripten des
westlichen und nördlichen Indien". In: Anzeiger der kaiserl. Akademie der
Wissenschaften zu Wien, Philos.-hist. Cl. 34, 8 (1897), pp. 48-52.

Kind regards,

Ego ex animi mei sententia spondeo ac polliceor
studia humanitatis impigro labore culturum et provecturum
non sordidi lucri causa nec ad vanam captandam gloriam,
sed quo magis veritas propagetur et lux eius, qua salus
humani generis continetur, clarius effulgeat.
