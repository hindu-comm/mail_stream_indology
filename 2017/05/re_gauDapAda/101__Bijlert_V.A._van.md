I had the same experience some years ago. Got an important article within a few minutes of asking. This is the digital age after all.
Best wishes
Victor

Dear Colleagues,
this is fantastic.  In half an hour I got three ansẃers. My warmest thatnks to you, Antonio, Victor and Madhav. I well remember the time, when, with a problem like this, I should have visited the library, filled the distant loan order and wait for one or two weeks for the book to come.

Best,
Klaus
