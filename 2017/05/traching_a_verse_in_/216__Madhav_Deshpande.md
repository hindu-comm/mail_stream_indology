I am trying to trace the following verse that is said to occur in the
Padmapurāṇa.  I don't have an edition of the Padmapurāṇa with a verse
index.  Is there a cumulative verse index to Purāṇas?  Any help is
appreciated.

bāhumūlakucadvandvayonisparśanadarśanāt

kasya na skhalati cittaṃ retaḥ skannaṃ ca no bhavet
