Dear Colleagues,

     In one of the curious passages of the Vedavicāra (written by
Śāmaśāstrī Draviḍa Dvivedī) that I am editing, the author says that though
the Gurjara's are included among Drāviḍas, other Drāviḍas do not have any
educational, ritual or marriage relations with them, because like the
Gauḍadeśa, there is too much anācāra "immoral behavior" among them, and
like the Brahmins of Kerala, they were cursed by an Ācārya, and therefore,
other Drāviḍas do not have any relations with them.  Here is the passage
from the text:

यथा गुर्जराणां द्राविडान्तःपातिनामपि द्राविडैः सह भोजनादिसंव्यवहारादिकं
नास्ति*, *तथैवाध्ययनादिकमपीति ज्ञेयम् । कुतो गुर्जराणां संव्यवहाराभाव इति
चेदुच्यते । गौडदेशवद्गुर्जरदेशेऽप्यनाचारबाहुल्यात् तेषामा
चार्यशापदग्धत्वात्केरलदेशीयब्राह्मणादिवत्संव्यवहाराभाव इति संक्षेपः ।

If anyone has a clue as to what this Ācāryaśāpa refers to, it would help me
make better sense of this passage.  Similarly, it is not clear what
anācārabāhulya he is referring to in the Gauḍa/Gurjara and Kerala regions.
Any suggestions will be helpful.  Best,
