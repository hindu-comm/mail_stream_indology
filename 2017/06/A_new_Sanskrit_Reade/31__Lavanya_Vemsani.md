Hello Antonia, 
First of all congratulations! I only have one small suggestion. If this is an introductory text, please include modern passages, may be from Sanskrit radio, movie, newspaper or speeches delivered by gurus in Sanskrit. I really think an introductory Sanskrit text should introduce students to the vibrant use of Sanskrit. It would be helpful to introduce different aspect of Sanskrit such as modern written and spoken communication in addition to the readings on ancient texts. 
Thank you.
