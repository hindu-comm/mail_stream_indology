Thanks for the kind replies. However "Notes on love …" from 1990 is not 
the published version of her disertation but a different book. She even 
mentions in its introduction that she never published her dissertation.
It is good to know about the possibilities on proquest.com but in this 
case I mereley want to check the context of a citation in an article and 
would be glad to avoid paying a considerable sum for this.
