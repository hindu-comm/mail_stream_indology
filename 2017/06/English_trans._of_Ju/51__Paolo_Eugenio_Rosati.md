Dear list members,

I am looking for the Introduction of this book:

Carl Gustav Jung and Károly Kerényi (eds) 1942. *Einführung in das Wesen
der Mythologie*.

I already have an Italian trans. of this pubblication, but I need of an
English trans.

More specifically, I need of a short passage in the first essay
(Introduction), written by K. Kerényi, where "mythologem" is defined.

Best,
Paolo
