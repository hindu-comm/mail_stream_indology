I'm not sure what 'hailed from' implies in this context (it could be an 
ancestral connection), but it would have been good to see a textual 
source. Pingree, while not infallible, states (CESS A3, 177b ff.) that 
Nīlakaṇṭha was 'a resident of Dharmapura on the Godāvarī in Vidarbha' 
and '[o]ne of the leading astrologers at Kāśī in the late 16th century'. 
(Śaka 1509 = 1587 CE; the 1567 is probably just a misprint.)

(Incidentally, Nīlakaṇṭha didn't actually author the Praśnatantra:)
