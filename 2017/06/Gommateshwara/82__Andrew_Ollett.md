Artur,

A.N. Upadhye has two articles on the subject in his 'Papers' (Univ. of
Mysore Prasaranga), where he shows that it is a desi Prakrit word (also
used in Kannada and Marathi, where the single-m spelling is found) meaning
'handsome,' and was one of the titles of Camundaraya (hence Gommatesvara,
'Camundaraya's Lord,' and Gommatasara).

Dear List,

What is the etymology of Gommata (गोम्मट, ಗೊಮ್ಮಟ), as in Gommatagiri? And -
why the statue of Bahubali at Go*mm*atagiri is called Go*m*ateshwara?

Thanks in advance,
