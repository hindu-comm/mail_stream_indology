Friends:

I need help in identifying and finding the correct reading of a verse ascribed in a manuscript I am reading to Vyāsa:


ऊर्ध्वबाहुर्विरौम्येव न च कश्चिच्छृणोति मे ॥

धर्मादर्थश्च कामश्च स किमर्थं न सेव्यते ॥

My manuscript is dark and unclear. I am not sure of “viraumyeva” and kaścic chṛṇoti” (which could also be kaścid vṛṇoti”). Any help greatly appreciated. With best wishes,

Patrick
