Artur-ji,

Spells that you mention belong to the category of Shaabara mantras,
sometimes called siddha mantras or Shaabara Siddha mantras. These are not
in Sanskrit. They are usually in regional Indian languages (including south
Indian languages), particularly their rustic dialects.

Sharing the snapshot of a Hindi article. (Since you know Hindi, you should
be able to follow). There are books and articles about these in regional
Indian languages.

You called hem mysterious. They consider them to be encryption.

You may see books like http://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/

----------------------------------

You say Ismail Jogi is contradictio in adiecto. To those who are aware of
several different 'Hindu'-Islamic syncretisms in India it doesn't appear to
be contradictio in adiecto.

Close to my native town, there is a Veerashaiva-Islamic math. Bham Bam BAba

Sheik Abdul Baba, the founder of the math, composed songs with content both
from Islam and 'Hinduism' in Kannada and Telugu.

There are Muslim Vaishnavas. Sharing a snapshot from

The Foundations of the Composite Culture in India

.

Street magic performers, spell healers and other such practicing groups are
not water tight compartments. There is a big section of this type of
illusion art-supernatural practitioners who are muslims. All those who
studied these cultures through direct close observation know that Muslims
among these use 'Hindu' deity names, 'Hindu' occult material and pooja
material like Turmeric and Kumkum powders etc. Their 'clients call using
them names such as Swami, Jogi etc. also alongside names such as Baba etc.

The spell you quoted belongs to this kind of cultural complex where Islamic
Jogi is common place, not strange and not at all contradictio in adiecto.

.............................

I do not know the language used in the spell to the level of being able to
give word for word meaning to it.

Some movement after five years of your waiting ?
