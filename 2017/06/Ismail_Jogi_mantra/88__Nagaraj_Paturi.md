Oṁ namo kāmrū des kāmākhyā devī

Tahāṁ base ismāil jogī


Ismāil jogi ke tīn beṭā


Ek toṛe ek pichoṛe


Ek śīt tijārī goḍe


------------------------

Let us try the outward meaning:


Om Namo (Well known beginning of such rituals, spells etc. ) (Om, the
Vedic syllable, namah, literally, bowing =obedience) , expression of
worshiping attitude

----

kāmrū des kāmākhyā devī

(Let me remember, focus on , concentrate on ) kāmāmākhyādēvī of kāmrūp region

Note: In the magecian's /spell-healer's patter/formulaic recitation,
mention of the Devi forms , particularly of nearby region is a
convention.

In south India, such rural rustic practitioners usually mention
kāmākṣī of kāñcī, mīnākṣī of madurai, viśālākṣī of kāśī (vāraṇāśī) as
a beginning of their ritual /spell event. They may add a few more
Devis.

-------

Tahāṁ base ismāil jogī


= Ismail Jogi who lives (base) there (tāhām)


------


Ismāil jogi ke tīn beṭā

There are three sons to Ismail Jogi


-------

Ek toṛe ek pichoṛe


Ek śīt tijārī goḍe


This part of the riddle, I give up. Ek =one śīt = cool , cold


----?????----
