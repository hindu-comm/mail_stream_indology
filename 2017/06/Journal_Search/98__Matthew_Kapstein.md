Hello friends,

I thought that there was an online archive of the
Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde Süd- und Ostasiens
but on the OAW one finds only the issues that have appeared
recently, since it became an e-journal.

Are earlier issues available online? This will save me having to
burden you all with the article requests that, in all events,
you fulfill with such good grace.

best,
Matthew
