Dear Friends, Would one of you be so kind as to provide the following
provocative 3-page article below. It seems that not all jstor subscriptions
are equal. It is on jstor, but our budget version doesn't give access.

McCone (Kim): Varia II: 1. OIr. broimm `fart', Skt. bráhma `pious
ef usion, prayer, spirit'.
In Ériu 36 (1985), pp. 169- 171.
