An astrological text (the /Tājikamuktāvali/ by Tuka, of the Gārgīya 
gotra), dating to 1549-50 CE, describes its place of origin thus:

śrīvājapeyādikayajñakṛdbhir vidvaddvijendrair bahubhiḥ śrutena |
nikumbhavaṃśaikanṛpeśvarasya śrīpippalagrāmavare kṛteyam ||

I should greatly appreciate any suggestions on where this 'Pippalagrāma 
of [the?] one king of the Nikumbha dynasty' (if that is how the verse 
should be construed) is likely to have been found.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
