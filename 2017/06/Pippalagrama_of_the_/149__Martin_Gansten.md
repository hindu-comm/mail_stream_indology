Many thanks to Ashok Aklujkar and Madhav Deshpande for their prompt 
replies! There was a discussion on the list about two years ago 
concerning the name Tuka itself, which also seemed likely to be of 
Marathi origin. I am still wondering about the 'one great king' of the 
Nikumbhas, which does sound as though the author had a particular ruler 
in mind. It needn't have been a contemporary king, of course -- it might 
be someone associated historically with the founding of Pippalagrāma.
