Thank you, Ashok. Yes, I am familiar with this use of eka -- in fact, 
another author I am working on (Tejaḥsiṃha) is partial to it, using 
expressions like sadguṇaughaikapātram and saukhyaikapātram. The example 
you mention is perhaps from this verse used by Śrīvaiṣṇavas?

yo nityam acyutapadāmbujayugmarukmavyāmohatas taditarāṇi tṛṇāya mene |
asmadguror bhagavato 'sya dayaikasindho rāmānujasya caraṇau śaraṇaṃ 
prapadye ||

But to return to Tuka Jyotirvid, regardless of whether we translate his 
phrase literally as 'one' or as 'peerless' etc., I do get the feeling 
that he had a particular Nikumbha ruler in mind. I thought that perhaps 
there might be someone associated with the founding of one or more 
settlements, possibly in Maharashtra.

> Sorry, I overlooked to add the following in my first response to your post: eka in some uses functiions as an emphasizing word, somewhat like eva and probably after having a semantic history like ‘one’ —> ‘absence of the second, not having any other similar entiry’, unparalleled, unchallenged’. Therefore, in the verse you have cited nikumbha-vaṃśaika-nṛpeśvarasya can easily mean ‘who was the sole/sovereign/peerless lord of/in the Nikumbha lineage.’ Extensive dictionaries in common use (Roth-Böhtlingk, Apte, Monier-Williams, etc.) do recognize this meaning one way or the other. I also recall reading a structurally similar compound dayaika-sindhoḥ somewhere. Perhaps someone on this list can help me in recalling where I could have read it.
