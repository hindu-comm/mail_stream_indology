There was also a primer-cum-reader, based on SavitrI, by
Richard Robinson that was used at the U of Wisconsin in first yr. Skt. when I
was a student there in the late 60s. It was mimeographed, never otherwise
published.

I have quite a lot of material on Indian primers and readers of the late 19th and early 20th c.,
but do not have the time at this moment to write that up.
