Dear Dean,

I have flashcards for all the vocabulary from my textbook, as well as for
most declensional forms and sandhi combinations on the brainscape site that
is available here:

http://cambridge-sanskrit.org/other-resources-links/

St James Schools, who teach Sanskrit to secondary-school students, also
have their flash cards on Brainscape:

https://www.brainscape.com/packs/sanskrit-4799882

Accessing them means signing up for a brainscape account, but that is free
and just there so that the site can remember your learning statistics.

All the best,
    Antonia
