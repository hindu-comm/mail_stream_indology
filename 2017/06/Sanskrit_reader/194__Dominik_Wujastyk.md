Dear Antonia, You refer to the familiarity of the format and
same-page-ness; this is something I hadn't thought about, but of course
you are exactly right.  The way the material is presented visually is also
critically important to a good learners' book (and one of the many good
things about your CIS).  I hope Brill can stump up for a designer for you.

Best,
Dominik
