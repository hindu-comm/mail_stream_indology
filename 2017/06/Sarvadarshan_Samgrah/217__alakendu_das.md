 Thanks for the response. I have  ,in my possession , the Bengali transalation by Satyajyoti 

Chakravarty. I would certainly search  for the translation by Cowell & Gough. 



  In fact, SarvadarshanSamgraha is such a text ,where one finds the entire gamut of Indian 

philosophy in one single volume.More so,Because Madhhyachrya was a Vedantist, but had wide 

exposure to all other schools,quite like Bachaspati Misra.( He  enjoyed an epithet- Shada Darshan 

 TikaKrit)





                                       Thanks everybody.



                                                         ALAKENDU DAS.
