Daer Alakendu,

You may wish also to consult
Klaus K. Klostermaier,
Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha ascribed to Mādhavācārya, Chapter 16: Śaṅkaradarśanam
 (Chennai: The Adyar Library, 1999)
for the translation of the last chapter, which was not included in Cowell & Gough.

Also, in a very important article,
Anantalal Thakur, “Cannibhaṭṭa and the authorship of the
Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha,”
 Bulletin of the Adyar Library
 25(1961): 524–538

it is very convincingly shown that Mādhava was not in fact the author of the SDS.
Thakur's remarkable detective work has unfortunately been overlooked by
most scholars for a half century!

I have discussed some questions raised by the SDS here:

best,
