Dear James, dear all,

I am likely to get a pdf from Toronto (according to WorldCat, their
university libraries are the only ones to have copies). However, if someone
on the list already has a scan of some kind and would be willing to share
that, I would be most grateful for a copy! (If not, I will mail you (and
anyone else who is interested) the pdf if/as soon as I get it from Toronto.)

All best,
   Antonia
