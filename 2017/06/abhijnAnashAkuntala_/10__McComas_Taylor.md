Dear Colleagues


Every year, I read a section of Abhijñānaśākuntala with my third-year students. As part of their assessment, students are asked to undertake a creative project in which they 'make the story their own' in any medium in which they excel (except an essay).  Alex Watt has turned the play into dreamy, hallucinatory,  bed-time story with the help of younger members Watt family, which I am sure you will enjoy:

Please send me feedback which I shall happily pass on to Alex.


Yours


McComas
