Dear List,

I’m looking for a PDF of Richard De Smet (1953): The Theological Method of Śaṃkara, Ph.D. Thesis, Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome.

The thesis remained unpublished, yet it is reported that copies circulated widely and numerous studies refer to it.

Would anyone have a PDF or a copy on paper, or any hint on where to find it?
many thanks
