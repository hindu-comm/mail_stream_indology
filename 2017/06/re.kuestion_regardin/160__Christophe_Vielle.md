It seems that  Burnell refers here with this alternative (?) title (not found in the catalogues of MSS. from Kerala at hand, still to check in the NCC) to the Laghudharmaprakāśikā attributed to one Śāṅkara, also known as Śāṅkarasmṛti (ed. and English transl. N.P. Unni, Torino [Corpus Iuris Sanscriticum, 4], 2003 ; Unni dates the text to the 14th century AD; see also his Highways and Byways in Sanskrit Literature, New Delhi: Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2012, vol. 1 pp. 393-415 ; and A Survey of Smrti Literature, Thiruvananthapuram: International School of Dravidian Linguistics, 2013, pp. 153-158). On the anācāras of Kerala, see also C. Lalitha Kumari,  Laghudharmaprakāśikā: A Study, Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2004, pp. 116-38 (with a discussion of the term) and the Appendices (by Asko Parpola) in Parpola, Marjatta Kerala Brahmins in Transition: A Study of a Nampūtiri Family, Helsinki: the Finnish Oriental Society (Studia Orientalia, 91), 2000, pp. .

> I found an interesting reference in A. C. Burnell's The Ordinances of Manu, (Intro. p. xxxvii) to a work titled Anācāranirṇaya composed in Kerala to discuss "deviations" from Brahmanical Dharmaśāstras.  According the footnote on this page, this work was evidently attributed to Śaṅkara.  This may be the source of Śāmaśāstrī Draviḍa Dvivedi using the expression ācāryaśāpadagdha to refer to these regions.  Here is the passage from Burnell:

Here is the passage from the text:
