Dear Madhav:

Don Davis is the person to consult on this. There are several texts written about “anācāra” — which is, contrary to what it seems, is actually practices that are proper but goes against the ācāra of the smṛtis and are OK in Kerala. The CESMEO published a text called Śāṅkarasmṛti alias Laghudharmaprakāśikā, edited and translated by N. P. Unni in 2003. In Ch. 12 of that work there is a list of 64 anācāras.

I found an interesting reference in A. C. Burnell's The Ordinances of Manu, (Intro. p. xxxvii) to a work titled Anācāranirṇaya composed in Kerala to discuss "deviations" from Brahmanical Dharmaśāstras.  According the footnote on this page, this work was evidently attributed to Śaṅkara.  This may be the source of Śāmaśāstrī Draviḍa Dvivedi using the expression ācāryaśāpadagdha to refer to these regions.  Here is the passage from Burnell:


I wonder if anyone has come across this work titled Anācāranirṇaya.  Any help?

Dear Colleagues,

     In one of the curious passages of the Vedavicāra (written by Śāmaśāstrī Draviḍa Dvivedī) that I am editing, the author says that though the Gurjara's are included among Drāviḍas, other Drāviḍas do not have any educational, ritual or marriage relations with them, because like the Gauḍadeśa, there is too much anācāra "immoral behavior" among them, and like the Brahmins of Kerala, they were cursed by an Ācārya, and therefore, other Drāviḍas do not have any relations with them.  Here is the passage from the text:

यथा गुर्जराणां द्राविडान्तःपातिनामपि द्राविडैः सह भोजनादिसंव्यवहारादिकं नास्ति, तथैवाध्ययनादिकमपीति ज्ञेयम् । कुतो गुर्जराणां संव्यवहाराभाव इति चेदुच्यते । गौडदेशवद्गुर्जरदेशेऽप्यनाचारबाहुल्यात् तेषामाचार्यशापदग्धत्वात्केरलदेशीयब्राह्मणादिवत्संव्यवहाराभाव इति संक्षेपः ।

If anyone has a clue as to what this Ācāryaśāpa refers to, it would help me make better sense of this passage.  Similarly, it is not clear what anācārabāhulya he is referring to in the Gauḍa/Gurjara and Kerala regions.  Any suggestions will be helpful.  Best,
