Thanks to Christophe Vielle, who sent me this as well as other editions.

Dear list members,

I am looking for the Ānandāśrama edition of the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha ascribed to Mādhava. It came out in 1906, but reprints seem to have been made later. I need the full text. Could anyone help? Thanks in advance.

Johannes Bronkhorst
