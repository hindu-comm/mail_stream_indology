Jim Nye of the University of Chicago Library told me that when Anandasrama did a second edition of the same work it would start from scratch, so that another ASS edition of the same title will be a different text.

Dear list members,



I am looking for the Ānandāśrama edition of the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha ascribed to Mādhava. It came out in 1906, but reprints seem to have been made later. I need the full text. Could anyone help? Thanks in advance.
