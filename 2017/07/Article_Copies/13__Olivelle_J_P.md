Would someone be able to get me copies of these two articles recently noted by Eric:

Sarasvati, D.C. 1963. “The Mystic Significance of Letters.” The Adyar Library Bulletin XXVII (1-4): 89–115.

Shulman, David. 2014. “Notes on Camatkāra.” In Langauge, Ritual and Poetics in Ancienty India and Iran, ed. David Shulman, 249–276. Jerusalem: 2010


Thanks.
