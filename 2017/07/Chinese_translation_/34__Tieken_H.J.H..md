Dear list members,
In a passage dealing with possible sources of inspiration of Kālidāsa's Meghadūta Chintaharan Chakravarti (Indian Historical Quarterly 3 (1927), pp. 286 ff) mentions a certain Hsū Kan (196-221 AD), who in his Chinese translation of Nāgārjuna's Prajñāmūlaśāstraṭīkā describes a woman who requests a cloud to pass on a message to her far-away husband. I would like to know where I can find more information about this translator Hsū Kan, in particular his date and if something is known about his knowledge of Sanskrit Kāvya literature.
Best, Herman
