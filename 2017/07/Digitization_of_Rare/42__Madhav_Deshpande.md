Here is an exciting news report about digitization of rare books at the
BORI:

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/digitalisation-of-rare-books-at-bori/articleshow/59502406.cms

I hope the digitization projects succeed and the digitized books become
openly available to scholars worldwide.

Congratulations to Shrikant Bahulkar and his team at the BORI.
