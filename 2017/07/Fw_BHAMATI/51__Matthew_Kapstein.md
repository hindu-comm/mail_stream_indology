You're quite right, Herman,

One should never open an unsolicited attachment of any kind, even
if it appears to come from a friendly source.

Whether or not the list has a policy, best practice is to just to delete such messages,
particularly given recent malware attacks on servers throughout the world.

best to all,
Matthew
