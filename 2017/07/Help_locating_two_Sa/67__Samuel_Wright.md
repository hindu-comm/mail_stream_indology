Dear List,

I am trying to better locate two Sanskrit scholars from approximately 1750.

My source gives their locations only by region rather than city. It simply
gives:

   - Halāyudha Brahmacārin (Dravida)


   - Bhāskara Paṇḍita (Maharashtra)

Might anyone know more about either of these two scholars? I’ve looked in a
number of places, including the NCC, but have not found any information.

I would like to connect them to a specific city rather than simply a
region.

Many thanks,
Sam

Rajgir, Bihar
