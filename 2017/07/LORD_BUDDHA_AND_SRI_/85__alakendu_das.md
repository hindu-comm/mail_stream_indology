 To All,

          While going through a book on Ceylonese Buddhist Chronicles , I came across a 

reference from Dipavamsa ,which reads as follows-



                           DIPAGAMANAM BUDDHASSA DHATU CHA BODHIAGAMAM



          Evidently 'Dipaagamanam Buddhassa' this indicates a possiblity of Lord  Buddha 

laying  his blissful  step on Sri Lankan soil .



                         I was curious to know whether any other evidences exist hinting at 

Buddha's visit to Sri Lanka . Is it a fact that Lord Buddha himself came to Lanka or whetehr 

it was Emperor Ashoka's son Mahinda who first  introduced Buddhism to Sri LANKA ,during the 

reign of King Duttagamini 

                              ALAKENDU DAS.







                                             ALAKENDU DAS.
