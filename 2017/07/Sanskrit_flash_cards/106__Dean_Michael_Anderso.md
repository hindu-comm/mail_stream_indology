 Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit flash cards or lists of vocabulary to build a database?

There is also a set of flashcards with an audio CD created by Nicholai Bachman. It is available here:http://sanskritsounds.com/47/108-sanskrit-flashcards.html.

Does anyone know of any Sanskrit flash cards?
Or a database with a list of Sanskrit words and their translations that might be used to create a database for flash cards?
