Dear All

Motilal Banarsidass is to publish The Mythology of Brahma / Greg Bailey.
They require either PDF or printed book for printing it in India. Neither
the author nor the original publisher has a copy.

The Publisher is prepared to offer two complimentary copies in lieu of this.

Sincerely
Rajeev Jain
