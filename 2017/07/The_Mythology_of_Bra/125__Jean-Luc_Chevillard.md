Is THIS not a STRANGE commercial request to make on this mailing list?

Provided the whole operation is agreed upon by all the interested parties,
can they not BUY a second hand copy?

Abe Book
(which I access from France on URL
https://www.abebooks.fr

has currently two copies available:

one for 45 EUROS
one for 155 EUROS

That seems affordable ...
