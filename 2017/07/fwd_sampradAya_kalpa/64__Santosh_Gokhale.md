Dear Scholars,

I am looking for a PDF version of *Sampradāya Kalpadruma*  of *Viṭhṭhaleśa*.
Would be much obliged if anyone could share a copy of it.

Further, are they any scholars here who have researched further into the
thesis that *Jagannātha Paṇḍita* was a descendant of *Vallabhācārya* from
his mother’s side? I am aware of R B Athavale's work regarding this.

However, I have no further reference which establishes this firmly, and
pointers to any research papers on this would be helpful.

How does the  Puṣṭimārga tradition look at this thesis? Is it a widely held
belief in the tradition?

Kind regards,
Santosh Gokhale
