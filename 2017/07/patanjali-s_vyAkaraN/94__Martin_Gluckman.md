Dear friends,

I am trying to locate a copy of:

Patañjali's Vyākaraṇa-Mahābhāṣya, Āhnikas 1-3 with English translation and
notes, edited by K. V. Abhyankar and Jayadev Mohanlal Shukla, Bhankarkar
Oriental Research Institute, Poona, 1975.

If anyone is aware of a recent re-print or where to locate the original
1975 edition I would be most grateful.

With kindest wishes,

Martin Gluckman
