  My apologie for replying late to kind responses. All these days I was travelling widely and had 

connectivity problems.

                       Yes, I agree this is a standard Madhyamika doctrine.I wonder whether this  

qoute may be anyway  ascribed to Nagarjuna, who was the  chief proponent of Madhyamika or 

Sunnyavad doctrine.

                    However, i would look into the books and links referred by you.







                                                    ALAKENDU DAS.
