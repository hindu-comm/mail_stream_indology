Dear Indology-ists,

Between August 27 and 30, my small paper, uploaded long time ago to
Academia.edu

https://www.academia.edu/8718097/A_Short_Note_on_the_Hindi_Honorificum_-ji_in_Rocznik_Orientalistyczny_T._LX_Z._2_2007_pp._279-282_

had, quite unexpectedly, 163 visits - from all over the world.

I wonder - what was the reason for this sudden interest? Some conference?

If so, I was not informed about it. Was there any?

Best,

Artur Karp (ret.)

Chair of South Asian Studies
