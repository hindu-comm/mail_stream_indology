The Larger Petrograd Dictionary of Böhtlingk & Roth (PW) has made it a
principle to cite their sources and to add a direct quote. This is a
considerable advantage over other comprehensive Sanskrit dictionaries.
Searching for evidence of *avyakta* as a noun (m., n.) in the PW, the
success rate is comparatively high. It can be taken as a starting point for
further research.
