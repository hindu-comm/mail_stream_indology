Interesting suggestion. It is possible for mā + icchāmi to be micchāmi in
Ardhamāgadhī (or pseudo-Ardhamāgadhī) because lopa-sandhi is common in such
contexts (see Pischel §158), but since the phrase occurs in the context of
the pratikramaṇa, and in a few cases specifically refers to the evil of an
already-committed transgression (jaṃ khaṇḍiyaṃ jaṃ virāhiyaṃ tassa micchā
mi dukkaḍaṃ), it seems more natural to me to read it in the traditional way
rather than as a resolution not to desire evil deeds in the future.
