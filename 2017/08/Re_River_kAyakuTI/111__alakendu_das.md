Sir,   Did you notice the word "Pandyeshu" in the Raghuvamsa qoute referred by you.? Does it indicate the location of the river Karyakuti somewhere in the Pandya dynasty,who ruled for a considerable period of time from 3rd BCE to 17th CE....and Kalidasa thrived somewhere in 6 thCE.       Alakendu Das. No
