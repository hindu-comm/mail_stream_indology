> This explanation of Nāga(/Uraga)-pura as a city on the border of the Kā

> Dakṣiṇāvartanātha  (13th-14th c.) in his unpublished *dīpikā* on the

> century - the latter who also sometimes uses Dakṣiṇāvartanātha has
> possibly misread his source here or, as you guess, his text has been later
> corrupted), himself followed by  Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍita.
> The commentary of Vallabhadeva could be useful here, but I have not
> Goodall & Isaacson edition at hand.
> On his side, the commentator Hemādri says: uragākhyasyeti kalpitārtham.

> In Raghuvamsa 6th Canto and Verse 58 or 59
> अथोरगाख्यस्य पुरस्य नाथं first foot says about Nagapura or Uragapura
