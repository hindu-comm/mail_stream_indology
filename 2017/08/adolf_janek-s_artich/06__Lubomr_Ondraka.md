Dear colleagues,

thanks to my discussion with Federico Squarcini last year, I have learned that papers on the Yogasūtras written by a Czech scholar Adolf Janáček and published in the fifties in Archiv Orientální may still be inspirational for scholars interested in the Pātañjalayogaśāstra. Since these articles are not easily available (all volumes of the journal are in the Digital Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, but it's a bit cumbersome to get any particular article from this depository), I have uploaded them on archive.org.

1/ The Methodical Principle in Yoga According to Patañjali's Yoga-sūtras
Archiv Orientální 19 (Dec 1951): 514–567

2/ The 'voluntaristic' Type of Yoga in Patañjali's Yoga-sūtras
Archiv Orientální 22 (1954): 69–87

3/ The Meaning of pratyaya in Patañjali's Yoga-sūtras
Archiv Orientální 25 (1957): 201–260

4/ Two Texts of Patañjali and a Statistical Comparison of their Vocabularies
Archiv Orientální 26 (1958): 88–100

5/ To the Problems of Indian Philosophical Texts

All the best,
Lubomir
