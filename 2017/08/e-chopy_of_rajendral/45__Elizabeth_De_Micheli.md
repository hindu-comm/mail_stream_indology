Dear Colleagues,
a pdf of this book is available on archive.org, but I for one could not find it by looking for it in the normal way. However, a link to its pdf came up doing a search on duckduckgo.com. 
If you have had the same problem, or simply if you want a pdf of the book, here is the url to obtain it:
https://archive.org/download/Bibliotheca_Indica_Series/YogaAphorismsOfPatanjaliWithBhojaVritti-RlMitra1881bis.pdf

With best regards,
