Thank you, Professor Karashima, for documenting that Jacobi’s text had a corrected printing. This seems unusual, especially if your copy is not officially a second printing or the like.

In any case, we agree that paṅka ‘mud’ and its Apabhraṃśa form paṃku are not the subject of my inquiry. I am only interested in any evidences (especially in devanāgarī and other north Indian script mss) of a reading paṅku (paṃku)  Sanskrit paṅgu ‘lame’.

I attach jpegs of details showing the nyāyakaṇikā manuscript readings I mentioned in the original message in this thread. The original manuscript is in the Nepal National Archives. I have no images of juṣadhvaṅkaraṇī or svaditaṅkaraṇī.

Best wishes,

Elliot Stern

It is interesting that Jacobi's edition which I have reads correctly "panku"; see the attached photos, while the PDF, taken from the archive.org <http://archive.org/>., reads mistakenly "pauku".  His index reads rightly "panka". I am happy to know that I have a copy of  the corrected version of Jacobi's dissertation paper.

I did not see that Jacobi corrected this reading in the published edition,. but I also do not dispute that paṅklu is correct. I did not consult data input on the internet. Even the great scholars may have missed typographical errors!

Only the input data on the internet reads "sayala-mahivalaya-pauku". One must discern "edition" made by the great scholar from "data" input by somebody. Sayala-mahivalaya-paṅku means “mud in the whole world” (“der Schlamm im ganzen Lande”, ibid., p. 76). However, paṅku is a nom. sg. masc. form of paṅka in Apabhraṃśa.

>> >> I would like to draw on the collective manuscript reading experience of our list members. A Sanskrit word paṅgu is well known in dictionaries and printed texts. It denotes a ‘lame person’. In a passage of the ms of svaditaṅkaraṇī  (a palm leaf Malayalam script ms), a commentary on nyāyakaṇikā, this word appears only as paṅku with many repetitions in a long comment on a line in vidhivivekaḥ.. It is possible to argue that this reading paṅku should be corrected to paṅgu, because paṅku and paṅgu are both pronounced the same in the Malayalam language (i.e., the k is pronounced as g). This argument, however, seems weak to me. First, other words like prasaṅga always appear as expected in the svaditaṅkaraṇī ms. Second, a most likely 16th century devanāgarī ms of nyāyakaṇikā certainly reads paṅku in two of the three occurrences of paṅgu later in the commentary, and probably in all three of them (the first fifty or so folia of this ms, that would include the passage on which svaditaṅkarraṇī comments, are not available). In two of these instances, we see a correction to paṅgu, but one stands uncorrected. Third, the ms. of juṣadhvaṅkaraṇī (also a palm leaf Malayalam script ms) reads paṅku a few times, and also consistently renders words like prasaṅga as expected.
