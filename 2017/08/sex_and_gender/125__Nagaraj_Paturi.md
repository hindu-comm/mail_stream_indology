The first of the known Telugu Kavyas 'Sreemadaandhramahaabhaaratamu'
written by the 'Aadikavi' of Telugu Nannaya begins with the  following
mangalas'loka:


श्रीवाणीगिरिजाश्चिराय दधतो वक्षोमुखाङ्गेषु ये
लोकानां स्थितिमावहन्त्यविहतां स्त्रीपुंसयोगोद्भवाम्।
ते वेदत्रयमूर्तयस्त्रिपुरुषास्संपूजिता वस्सुरै
र्भूयासुः पुरुषोत्तमांबुजभवश्रीकन्धराश्श्रेयसे॥

Anvaya:

ये वेदत्रयमूर्तयः त्रिपुरुषाः पुरुषोत्तमांबुजभवश्रीकन्धराः श्रीवाणीगिरिजाः
वक्षोमुखांगेषु चिराय दधतः लोकानां स्त्रीपुंसयोगाद्भवां स्थितिं आवहंति ते
सुरैः संपूजिताः  वः श्रेयसे भूयासुः ।

The triad of Persons (the trimoorti ), embodiments of the three Vedas,
VishNu, Brahma and Shiva, who  having Lakshmi Saraswati and Parvati
eternally in their chest, mouth and body respectively , bestow the
existence (similar to their own) that is born of the communion of the
masculine and feminine (principles) to the worlds (too)  , (those three) that
get worshipped by suras , may they be there for our well being.
