Dear Prof. Tieken,

Thank you very much for the informative and suggestive message.

According to my data, except for Pali literature and Aśokan Minor Rock
inscriptions in question and two occurrences in unpublished fragments in
the Schøyen Collection, the form -*ū ti *occurs only in the
Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravādins' Mahāvastu, Bhikṣuṇīvinaya and
Prātimokṣasūtra. The Mahāsāṃghika school was predominant in Kaliṅga.

With best wishes,

Seishi Karashima
