Professor Grünendahl’s manual is indeed indispensable, since it covers Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam scripts as well, with lots of charts.  For comparative paleographic charts, though, you could consult:

Elements of South-Indian Palæography, from the Fourth to the Seventeenth Century, A. D.: Being an Introduction to the Study of South-Indian Inscriptions and Mss
by Arthur Coke Burnell
Trübner & Company, 1878:

Unfortunately, the Google Books scan, as so often, shows some of the plates folded up rather than open, so you’ll need to procure a hard copy from a library.

Dear Friends and Colleagues,
Might anyone suggest a good paleographical resource for manuscripts in Grantha script (as well as other scripts used in Sanskrit (or Tamil and Telugu) manuscripts produced in the South)? I'm presently making use of Bühler's Indische Palaeographie and any other resources would be much appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Charles
