Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Might anyone suggest a good paleographical resource for manuscripts in Grantha script (as well as other scripts used in Sanskrit (or Tamil and Telugu) manuscripts produced in the South)? I'm presently making use of Bühler's Indische Palaeographie and any other resources would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Charles
