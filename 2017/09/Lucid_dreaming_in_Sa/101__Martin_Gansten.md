Many thanks to all who replied to this query. So far there seems to be 
precious little material on lucid dreaming in Sanskrit, particularly in 
non-Buddhist sources. The reference to Patañjali is presumably to YS (or 
PYŚ, if one prefers) 1.38, but the connection looks slim to nonexistent 
to me; the same is true of Haṭha(yoga)pradīpikā 4.49, though I haven't 
explored any commentarial literature on that passage. The 
Hanneder/Mokṣopāya reference sounds more promising, and I'll try to 
follow it up. Eli Franco mentioned the term svapnāntika-jñāna, but not 
where it is found; I see that Monier-Williams (following Böhtlingk/Roth) 
gives the Vaiśeṣikasūtra as a source for svapnāntika -- an unlikely 
place for a discussion of lucid dreaming, I'd have thought, but worth 
looking up.

Thanks again,
Martin G.
