Additional thanks to Jan Houben and Eli Franco. The volume Jan mentions 
(/The Indian Night: Sleep and Dreams in Indian Culture/) is the one also 
referenced by Matthew Kapstein as containing, inter alia, Jürg 
Hanneder's piece on dreams in the Mokṣopāya. I had the chance to glance 
over that particular chapter, sent to me by a kind list member, earlier 
today; it was very interesting, but not really about lucid dreaming in 
the usual sense of the term.
