For the term yoganidrā and its meanings in yogic texts cf. very informative entry at the blog The Luminescent written by Jason Birch and Jacqueline Hargreaves "Yoganidrā: An Understanding of the History and Context":
http://theluminescent.blogspot.cz/2015_01_01_archive.html

Briefly, yoganidrā has no connection to lucid dreaming, it is either one of the synonyms for samādhi (early meaning), or the name of the āsana (modern practice: śavāsana combined with dissolution of the mind and other techniques).

Best,
Lubomir
