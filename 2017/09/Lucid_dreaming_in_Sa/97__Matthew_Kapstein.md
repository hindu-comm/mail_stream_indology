I forgot to add that the mahAjagrat "great awakening" of the MokSopaya,
discussed by Juergen Hanneder in his very interesting contribution to
http://indologica.de/drupal/?q=node/652
( a book that may be in any case pertinent)
also seems to intimate lucid dreaming. As Hanneder puts it (p. 93)
"a dream world (svapna) becomes a new waking state...."
