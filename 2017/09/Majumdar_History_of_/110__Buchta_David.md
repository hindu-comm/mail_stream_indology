Dear Prof. Griffiths,

The book is available through the West Bengal Public Library's website. The
website can be down now and then, but it seems to be working right now. And
unfortunately, they break their books up into multiple files, so for this
book you'll have to download about 15-20 files and then use Acrobat or the
like to combine them into one PDF.

Here's the link:

Best,
Dave Buchta
