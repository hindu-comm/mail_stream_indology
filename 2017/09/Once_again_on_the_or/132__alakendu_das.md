 Dr.Christophe Vielle,

                       Origin of  ZERO is ,indeed an enriching subject to focus on. I have been curiously 

following the discussion ,too. However, how about the fact that inhabitants of MAYA civilisation in 

Central & South America used Zero as far back as 1000.B.C? Does it pre date Bakshali Manuscript ?





                                                   ALAKENDU DAS.
