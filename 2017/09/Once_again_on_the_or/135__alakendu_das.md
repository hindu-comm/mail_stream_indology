  Camillo,

           Sorry for replying late,but I took some time to have a deeper look into the history of 

the Babylonian concept of zero.



                                   I enclose a qoute from Mathemetician  Robert Kaplan ...and 

leave the rest for you to decide.



                                                          ALAKENDU DAS.
