Sincere thanks to everyone who replied off-list. It appears, sadly, that
the recordings have not survived into the 21st century.

> I've come across a reference, in Alaka Atreya Chudal's book on Rahul

> Nalopākhyāna, Setubandha, etc.) that the Mahapandit made while he was a
> professor at Leningrad University (1945-1947). These recordings were
> evidently available some decades afterwards in "the acoustics room at the
> university," according to V. I. Kalianov. I've written to the institutions

> recordings, but I thought that I would ask all of you if you have any
> further information, especially since Sankrityayan is a relatively frequent
> topic of conversation on this list. It would be great to put those
> recordings online.

> I should also take the opportunity to ask whether any of you are aware of
> any other recordings of Prakrit literature. I was surprised to see the
> Setubandha in the list, since I know of many fine recordings of classical
> Sanskrit and Kannada texts, but haven't yet found anything comparable for
> Prakrit texts.
