Kālidāsa's mention of an Uragapura (or, in the reading known to Vallabhadeva, Nāgapura) seems to have given rise to several theories.

Dakṣiṇāvarta’s location of the place on a river Kāyakuṭī is, as we have seen, echoed in the commentary Mallinātha, but also in those of the Keralan commentators Aruṇagirinātha and Nārāyaṇapaṇḍita.  Unsurprisingly, the late medieval commentators from further North seem not to provide information about the identity of the place or the river that it lies on.

Nandargikar in his notes to his 4th edition is categoric that the town must be Nagapattinam, which he asserts without any supporting argument (1971:123): 

‘Hemâdri interpretes (sic) this by “nāgapurasya nāthaṃ.” But he is evidently wrong, the town alluded to here is nāgapaṭṭana or nāgapaṭṭaṇa (Negapattam) in the Râjamahendri district of the Madras Presidency.’

(I suppose that this might mean that Nandargikar supposed that Hemādri erroneously took the town to be the one that is now most famous under the name Nagpur.)

Then there is the possibility that Uragapura refers to Madurai (as in the post referred to by Emmanuel Francis: http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/1999-March/016494.html).

Others again think it must be in a suburb of Trichy, at the Northern edge of the Pāṇḍya area (Ghurye, Caste and Race in India, p. 357):
‘This is again the earliest and perhaps also the solitary reference to the famous early mediaeval and late ancient city or town of Uraiyur in Tiruchirapalli (Trichinopoly) district.’

Dhoyī’s Pavanadūta places the town on the bank of the Tāmraparṇī, which would preclude any identification with Nagapattinam, Madurai or Trichy: 

śrīkhaṇḍādreḥ parisaram atikramya gavyūtimātraṃ 
gantavyas te kim api jagatīmaṇḍanaṃ pāṇḍyadeśaḥ/
tatra khyātaṃ puram uragam ity ākhyayā tāmrapārṇyāḥ 
tīre mugdhakramukatarubhir baddharekhe bhajethāḥ// 8

But of course it is possible that Dhoyī knew little about Uragapura/Nāgapura, having simply read about it in, for instance, Kālidāsa’s Raghuvaṃśa in the context of the description of the Pāṇḍyan king, and that he decided on that basis that it must be on the bank of the Tāmraparṇī.

Furthermore, it is perhaps not especially likely that Kālidāsa had been there either.  It could simply have been famous to him as the Pāṇḍya capital, either in his own time, or in some legendary timeless time that he himself knew of only from other literary references.

We should look for a place called Perumarutūr. Today, you will find many Marutūrs in Tamil Nadu. There is a Perumarutūr in Pudukkottai District (https://www.google.com/maps/@10.0792648,79.1085514,15.95z <https://www.google.com/maps/@10.0792648,79.1085514,15.95z>). But there are no inscriptional records supporting this location as a settlement of Brahmins of high achievement.

The Iḷaiyāṉputtūr copper plates (Āvaṇam 18, p.10) mention a Perumarutūr, a village on the bank of the Kāviri river where Vedic Brahmins lived. The objective of the grant was to give a Brahmin from this village a Brahmadeya village called Iḷaiyāṉputtūr in Kōvilpaṭṭi-Caṅkaraṉkōvil region of today. R. Nagaswamy has discussed this inscription in http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article54.xml <http://tamilartsacademy.com/articles/article54.xml>.

SII 12, no. 184 refers to a Brahmin from Perumarutūr living in Ulakaḷantacōḻaccaturvetimaṅkalam identified with Omāmpuliyur near Chidambaram. (The inscription also refers to a Tiruvalañcuḻi Uṭaiyār Iccippeṟṟarayar of Aḻicupakkam.

Karandai Plates of 1021 mention a Brahmin from the same village receiving a share of the grant. Karandai Plates also mention another Brahmin from Perumarutūr but living in a different village. SII 26, no. 729 of 1219-20 CE in Tiruneṭuṅkaḷam in Tiruchi district mentions a Maṇṭaiyāḻvāṉ Vetanāyakapaṭṭan (Vedanāyakabhaṭṭa) of Kāśyapa gotra from Perumarutūr. Inscription SII 26, no. 140 of 1411 CE in Komaralingam in Coimbatore district mentions a Brahmin from Perumarutūr who acted as a representative of the Vijayanagara king.

I do not know if this was the Perumarutūr (contrasting with the Little Marutūr) mentioned in the inscriptions.

>> 
>> The place Tiruvalañcuḻi [Thiruvalanjuli, also near Kumbakonam] given by Ajay K. Rao 2014 (your reference) was suggested by T. Gaṇapati Śāstrī in his preface to the 1919 Trivandrum Sanskrit Series (no. 64) edition of the Meghasaṃdeśa with Dakṣiṇāvartanātha's Pradīpa (following the name of Śiva called Dakṣiṇāvartanātha in the sanctuary there, see: http://www.archive.org/details/MeghadutaWithTheCommentaryOfDaksinavartanatha <http://www.archive.org/details/MeghadutaWithTheCommentaryOfDaksinavartanatha> ). 
>> Unithiri 1976 (see below) suggests another Tiruvalañcuḻi… in Kerala (Thrissur District), with the idea that D would be the Sanskritised form of a Malayalam place-name [Tiru +] "valañcuzhi (dakṣiṇa = valam, 'right' + āvarta = cuzhi, 'whirlpool')". (Unni 1987, pp. 34-38, in discussing these suggestions even adds a third, Keralan also, Tiruvalañcuḷi place, but he does not accept the Keralan ones and keeps the idea of the name Dakṣiṇāvartanātha as referring to the peculiar name of Śiva in the Tamil tradition linked to Tiruvalañcuḻi near Kumbakonam). As we have seen, D gives the Sanskrit name of his place of origin (which could correspond to Tiruviṭaimaruttūr" [Thiruvidaimaruthur] near Kumbakonam, and thus close to the shrine of his name-deity according to N. P. Unni), for which you make now another suggestion of interpretation (Tiruppuṭaimarutūr [Thiruppudaimaruthur], Ambasamudram taluk in Thirunelveli Distr. - http://tnmurals.org/Tiruppudaimaruduur.html <http://tnmurals.org/Tiruppudaimaruduur.html> : mural paintings in the temple).
>> 
>> As for the relative dating, according to T. Gaṇapati Śāstrī the date of D must be between the 12th c. (since D quotes the lexicon of Keśavasvāmin [ed. TSS 23, 29, 31, 1913] dated by Gaṇapati Śāstrī to the 12th c. - but this lexicon belongs probably rather to the 2nd part of the 13th c. according to Madhukar M. Patkar, History of Sanskrit Lexicography, 1981, p. 97) and Aruṇagirinātha's time  (contemporary of  Mallinātha, early 15th century).
>> Examining the peculiar relationships between Dakṣiṇāvartanātha's Pradīpa and Pūrṇasarasvatī's Vidyullatā, S.K. De (intr. to his critical ed. of the poem, 1957, p. xxxi fn. 92 ; cf. also 1957 below, pp. 51-52) presumes that D is prior to P. This is also the opinion of Unni with a few more arguments (1987, pp. 52-53, cf. 2016 below). But Unithiri, who has made a closer comparison between the two (1976: "It is to be noticed that in almost all cases [when D differs from P in readings] D[a]k[ṣiṇāvartanātha] notes the variant readings which are those  of P[ūrṇa]s[arasvatī] and in most cases those of P[a]r[ameśva] also, indicating thereby that Dk corrects the traditionally accepted readings for his own reasons" — about 20 such occurrences) has suggested the reverse (1975, p. viii; cf. also Iyer 1965, stressing on the differences between the Kerala textual tradition of Pūrṇasarasvatī/Parameśvara, on the one hand, and the one of Dakṣiṇāvartanātha/Mallinātha on the other).
>> 
>> Having myself several reasons to place P in the first part of the 14th c. (he must be close to Payyūr Bhaṭṭa Parameśvara 'I', fl. c. 1330, whose Sumanoramaṇī criticizes the Vidyullatā in a manner letting think that the two authors were very near in time and place), it would mean that D would belong either to to middle/second part of the 14th c. (close to both Mallinātha and Aruṇagirinātha — there is some connexion between them by their respective choices of names: A and M inspired by/having studied with D?) if he comes after, or to 2nd part of the 13th c. if he come before. I am at the moment of my examination rather inclined to place D after P.

According to Monier Williams, kāya also means "assemblage , collection , multitude SaddhP.” This seems to be a synonym of saṅgha (perhaps referring to the legendary Tamil assembly in Madurai) or a translation of ‘Ta. Kūṭal’, another name of the city of Madurai.

Kólkhoi emporion, Ptolemy Geogr. 7, 1, 10). But the Tamil word kāyal ('backwater, mouth of a stream") is far from the meaning of "Curve of the body" (kuṭī is found in several words for/names of "curving" rivers). The Tāmraparṇī  herself is described by Kālidāsa in 4.50 (53  crit. ed. Goodall & Isaacson).
>>>>>> This explanation of Nāga(/Uraga)-pura as a city on the border of the Kāyakuṭī  river in the  Pāṇḍya country was already made by  Dakṣiṇāvartanātha  (13th-14th c.) in his unpublished dīpikā on the Raghuvaṃśa according to N. P. Unni (Highways and Byways in Sanskrit Literature, Delhi: New Bharatiya Book Corporation, 2012, p. 159, who relies on a KUML transcript-manuscript). It is in this case (like in other) the source of  Aruṇagirinātha (contemporary of  Mallinātha, early 15th century - the latter who also sometimes uses Dakṣiṇāvartanātha has possibly misread his source here or, as you guess, his text has been later corrupted), himself followed by  Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍita.
