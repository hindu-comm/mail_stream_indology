Dear list members,
I am looking for a pdf of a booklet with instructions on how to write the Tamil alphabet, or else a link to a (you tube) film. I did find a film but only for one or two letters.
This is a question which I would normally have submitted to Jean-Luc Chevillard's Classical Tamil list, but I have the impression that this list is no longer active.
With kind regards, Herman
