Apologies for any crossposting. I would like to draw the attention of the
list to this upcoming workshop in Munich. I, among others, would very much
like to see abstracts sent from those working on Buddhist commentarial
literature produced in the South Asia, Central Asia, and the Himalayan
region.

The Doctoral Program in Buddhist Studies at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München is pleased to announce a call for
papers for the workshop "Layers of Interpretation - Commentarial Practices
Throughout Buddhist Textual Traditions,"
to be held on June 15-16, 2018 in Munich, Germany, with keynote addresses
by Prof. Rupert Gethin (University of Bristol) and Prof. Alexander Mayer
(University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign).

We invite applications from both established and early career scholars,
including PhD students.
The deadline for applications is November 15, 2017.
