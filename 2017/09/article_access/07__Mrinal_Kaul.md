Dear Colleagues,

It seems that somehow I still cannot have access to the following article
even if I have access to the *Journal of Indian Philosophy* through several
platforms. Would somebody be kind enough to send this article to me if they
have access to it?

*Fathers, sons and gurus: Oedipal conflict in the Sanskrit epics*
*Journal of Indian Philosophy, 1978, Volume 6, Number 4, Page 325*
*R. P. Goldman*

Thanks very much in advance. Thanks.

Mrinal Kaul
