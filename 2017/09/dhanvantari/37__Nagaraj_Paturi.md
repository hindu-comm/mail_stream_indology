has an entry on Dhanvantari at pages 52-54.

As per this, Dhanvantari is not directly mentioned in the Vedas. The
earliest mention is in Mahabharata Adi 1140.

Sharing a snapshot of the relevant page.

I said in an earlier post on a similar topic,

"The word 'Vedic' is not always used in the sense of ' as in Vedas'. The
word is quite often used in the sense of 'belonging to the lineage of the
cultural/textual complex of which the Vedas are (of course, vital)
part. From the insider's point of view , Vaidika is Veda- aviruddha,
Veda-anuroopa, Veda-anusaari etc. not necessarily Vedochcharita/Vedas'ruta."

The references provided in the pages 52-54 of this book establish that
Dhanvantari is  Vedic as per the perspective mentioned above in my words.
