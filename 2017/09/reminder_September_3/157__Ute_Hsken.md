Dear Colleagues,

we would like to alert you of the deadline for applications for the four 
week intensive course in Varanasi (September, 30^th 2017). We would be 
grateful if you could widely circulate this call for applications among 
potential participants.

The course

*"Lived Sanskrit Cultures in Varanasi" *

will take place in Varanasi from *19th Feb. to 16th Mar. 2018.*

The course will be carried out by the Cultural and Religious History of 
South Asia (Classical Indology) department at Heidelberg University and 
the Indology department at Würzburg University, in cooperation with 
Prof. Gopabandhu Mishra (BHU). Three broad areas will be covered: 
"Teaching Sanskrit and the Veda", "Performing Rituals", and "Kāśīyātrā: 
Processions in Varanasi". An essential part of the course will be to 
include gender perspectives in the study of all the three mentioned areas.
