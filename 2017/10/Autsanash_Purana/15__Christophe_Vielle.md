Here is the reference to a recent edition of the Vindhyamāhātmya claiming to be part of the Auśanasapurāṇa  which is, a Dominik pointed out, the text here concerned:

> I asked about the spelling he uses but he didn't clarify this point, this -t-, it seems, is more than a typo, as it appears in several publications of his regarding this pilgrimage.

> the scanned pages were simply given for completing the information you gave from Rocher (who relies on Hazra, whose books are sometimes difficult to find - I see now that Rocher refers also to a 1954 article by Hazra, which, I guess, has nothing more than what is in his book since he was not reproduced in Hazra Commemoration Volume which is like is "kleine Schriftern"). By the way, as usually with the puraa.nas, the fact that a 'genuine' or original (here AuzanasaP) does no longer exist (if it once really existed - its mentioning in a traditional list of 18 does not mean much according to me) is one thing (I should have written "there was…" or "there could have been…"), the other is the existence of actual texts claiming to belong/to be part of this puraa.na (as a kind of "virtual" one, as it is with the main puraa.na titles, Skanda etc. to which claim to belong many "parts", maahaatmyas etc.) - as you very rightly pointed out, what is here important is the title 'Vindhya-maahaatmya" claming to belong to this AuzanasaP (or B.rhad-Auzanasa according to Hazra fn. 61 - relying on manuscripts). Reading again what Singh says, "Autsanash Purana, AP (27.30)" to which he refers only once (on p. 127) = here "Vindhya Mahatmya [cf. the ref. "VM 27" just before]… claiming to be part, or different version, of AP" (in fact elsewhere he refers only to Vindhya Mahatmya/VM). Just after, when he talks about "Many popular booklets… which give abridged versions of the above two texts", it is a bit confusing but it seems that he refers to 1° VM (= AP) and 2° DM (Deviimaahaatmya), to which he has also just alluded.

>> A quick look in the index of Ludo Rocher's fine history of puranic literature shows an Auśanasapurāṇa, which is probably what Singh is trying to refer to.  P. 138 gives more information about this "lost" purāṇa, which is sometimes conflated with the Vindhyamāhātmya, that Singh also cites.  That's probably the basis of the information that Singh is garbling.
