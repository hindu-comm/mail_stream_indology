Respected scholars,

I would be obliged if the list members can draw my attention to publication
details of some commentaries on five mahakavyas and meghadutam with some
emphasis on grammar.

Currently I am editing a work 'durghatasangraha' which deals with
grammatically difficult parts of these works. Hence the need.

With Regards,
