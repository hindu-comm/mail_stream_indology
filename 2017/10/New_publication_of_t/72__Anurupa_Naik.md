This multifaceted novel projects us into a village in Tamil Nadu which 
is believed to have been established by Telugu people, who like many 
others centuries ago, left Andhra and its turmoil to settle in the 
peaceful environment of southern Tamil Nadu. Belonging himself to such a 
village, Ki. Rajanarayanan, a gifted story-teller, succeeds in giving us 
an authentic view of rural Indian life in all its depth and moving humanity.

Tamil writer whose work includes novels, short-stories and numerous 
essays. Equally involved in folklore and deeply concerned withrural 
life, he has, since the nineteen-fifties, never stopped documenting his 
karisal region through its oral literature, dialect specificities, ways 
of life and mentalities. He inspired a whole generation of writers and 
has trained folklore specialists in Tamil Nadu. He received the Sahitya 
Akademi award in 1991.

*About the translator*

Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations (INALCO, Paris) is in
