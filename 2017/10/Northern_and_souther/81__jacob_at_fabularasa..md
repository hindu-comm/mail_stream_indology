PS: I should have added that the chart was allegedly made in the village 
of Siriyari near Deogarh, Rajasthan, a predominantly Marwari-speaking 
area close to a predominantly Mewari-speaking area.

Hi Martin and Tyler,

Here's a detail from a snakes-and-ladders chart dated samvat 1818 
(though I suspect it may be perhaps even a good deal later). It may not 
be exactly what you are looking for, but it does an interesting job of 
combinining devanagari and Gujarati script. The 'k's and 'l's are 
clearly Gujarati script, while the 'd's and the connecting line at the 
top is clearly devanagari. I guess it might just be a regional adoption 
of Gujarati graphemes into a predominantly devanagari-writing area, but 
I have only seen very few examples of it elsewhere.

Best,
Jacob
