I notice inconsistent use of pṛṣṭhamātrā similar to the use Madhav reported in the oldest manuscript of nyāyakaṇikā available to me. My impression is that the original copyist generally used pṛṣṭhamātrā but used non pṛṣṭhamātrā forms in some instances to correct what he originally wrote. I must stress that this is only am impression!
