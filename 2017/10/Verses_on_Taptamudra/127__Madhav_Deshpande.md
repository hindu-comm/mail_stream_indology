Hello Måns,

     In part you may be dealing with Madhva's citations that are considered
to be imagined texts by the critics of the Mādhvas.  For a critique of this
practice of Taptamudrādhāraṇa, you can consult Appayya Dīkṣita's
Madhvatantramukhamardana and Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's Tantrādhikārinirṇaya.
Perhaps these critiques contain some discussion of the Madhvaite sources
for this practice.
