Though sources quoted, like Rigveda, Padma Purana etc. , are obviously
pre-Madhva, quoting history starts from Sumadhva Vijaya (9-39) , a
hagiography of Madhvacharya and the most quoted are Vadiraja's
(Vaadiraaja's) Chakrastuti., Yuktimalika..

Sumadhva Vijaya is older than 16th century.

Vadiraja is from 17th century.
