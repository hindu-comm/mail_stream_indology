Many thanks to Roland Steiner and Lubomír Ondračka for pointing out that 
Böhtlingk's later /Sanskrit-Wörterbuch in kürzerer Fassung /in fact 
gives 'Brandwunde' as the meaning of agnidāha, rather than the name of a 
disease. This was how I had first understood the word, before I happened 
upon the MW entry.
