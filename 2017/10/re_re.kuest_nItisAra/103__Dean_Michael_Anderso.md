India reprints vast numbers of books whose copyright has expired. In fact, it's a boon for scholars to be able to find printed versions of classic Indology texts.
Best, 

Dean

It might not be. Copyright and being on sale or being published are different things. An author's copyright expires sixty years after the death of the author.  There are variations and details, but that's a good general rule of thumb.
