The Buddhist Digital Resource Center (formerly Tibetan Buddhist Resource
Center) has released a mobile app for both iOS and Android. Right now, only

The mobile app makes it possible to access texts from BDRC’s library with a
few taps on a mobile touchscreen, whether the user is in a remote area or a
major city.
