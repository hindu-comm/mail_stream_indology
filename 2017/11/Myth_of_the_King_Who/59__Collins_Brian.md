Dear List,

I read a story in the epics or puranas about a king kicked out of heaven because his fame on earth had faded and he had to go find a living person who remembered his name in order to be let back in. Unfortunately, that person was not me because I canâ€™t remember his name either. Does anyone remember where to find this story?

Thanks,

Brian
