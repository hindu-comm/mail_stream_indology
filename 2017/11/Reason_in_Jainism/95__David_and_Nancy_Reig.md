Dear Karl-Stephen,

Regarding your point no. 2, I do not know what sources there might be about
the historical context which led Jainas to involve themselves in debates
and controversies with their opponents. However, a major source on their
debates and controversies per se from before Haribhadra's time is the Dvādaś
āram nayacakram, which lays out the views of the philosophical systems
prevalent in India at that time, drawing on very old sources (e.g., the
lost Ṣaṣṭitantra for Sāṃkhya). The best edition (and restoration) is that
by Muni Jambuvijayaji in three volumes, 1966, 1976, 1988. But perhaps this
is long since known to you, or is not what you are looking for.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
