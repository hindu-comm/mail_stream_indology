After the orality - litercy paradigm of analysis became popular, a big
number of publications and conference papers in regional Indian languages
made interesting observations.

Prof. Velcheru Narayana Rao in his PhD dissertation written in Telugu uses
the word dvikartrikatva to refer to the the authorship of the dictating
composer anticipating the role of an explaining / elaborating
lecture-performer such as a pauraaNika and the 'authorship' of the
explaining / elaborating lecture-performer such as a pauraaNika.

I propsed in my conference paper

https://www.academia.edu/8614163/Marga_and_Desi_in_Narrative_Comparative_Literature_-National_seminar_on_Narratology_of_Indian_Literature_Telugu_University_Prelude_to_founding_the_Comparative_Literature_Department_Telugu_University_1989

that

gadyapadyamis'ra format of champū is a result of bringing the lyric -prose
/ verse-prose narrative performance art technique into text-composing.

There could be more regional Indian (language) writings.
