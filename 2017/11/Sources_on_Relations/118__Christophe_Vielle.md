In the margin of this thread, or as a very special case, following this article just issued in the Hindu
http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/strings-attached/article19982142.ece

attention can be drawn to the traditional shadow-puppetry performed in several Bhagavati temples of Palakkad, Malappuram and Thrissur Distr. of Kerala, called Tōlpāvakūttu. See, with a focus on the relationship between oral and literary traditions, the work of Stuart Blackburn, Inside the Drama-House: Rāma Stories and Shadow Puppets in South India, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996 – e-version here: http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5q2nb449;brand=ucpress (cf. also Gopal Venu, Tolpava Koothu: Shadow Puppets in Kerala, New Delhi: Sangeet Natak Akademi, 1990; Laurent Aubert, Les Feux de la Déesse: Rituels villageois du Kerala (Inde du Sud), Lausanne: Payot, 2004, pp. 107-121). Here attached the picture no. 2 in the article, showing the manuscripts (in Malayalam script for the one readable) attached to the oral performances (on the basis of the Kampan Rm stanzas, with written and free amplifications, the former called āṭalpāṭṭu, mixing Tamil, Malayalam and Sanskrit), preserved (?...) by the puppeteers.

How has that relationship evolved with the emergence of written texts, vernacularization, and the subsequent privileging of textual sources by the colonial West and the Academy? Who is excluded and/or included by the privileging of one kind of knowledge over the other? For scholars, what kind of nuanced understanding of literacy should be sought or acknowledged given that "to be literate" can mean different things in different cultures?
