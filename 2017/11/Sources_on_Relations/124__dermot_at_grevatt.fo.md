Dear Herman,

A forthcoming article gives some of the history of the transformation of an oral corpus of 
Kannada bhakti poetry into a printed corpus, initiated by missionaries in the 19th century. 
Would that be relevant to your work? I give details and abstract below.

"Dasa Sahitya: Some Notes on Early Publications" by Shashikantha Koudur. Religions of 
South Asia 10.3 

Abstract: Dasa Sahitya is a literary genre in Kannada, first seen in the late fifteenth 
century. Making its mark both in literature and in Indian classical music, Dasa 
Sahitya attracted the attention of missionaries and other colonial functionaries, 
and was one of the first genres to be edited and published in Kannada in the 
mid-nineteenth century. Very soon, native editors and publishers started working 
on the genre. Usually classified under bhakti literature in the literary 
historiography of Kannada literature, Dasa Sahitya was published by individuals of 
varying interests. This essay makes a survey of some of the early publications of 
the genre, and notes varying concerns and interests with which they were 
produced. We refrain from classifying these works as either `colonial´ or 
`nationalist´, while noting that the genre and the associated works were 
inextricably linked to the Brahmin community from the days of the early 
publications, even as this community projected it as part of `Kannada´ culture. We 
also note evidence of cultural opposition to the change from manuscript to print.

I've been following this discussion with great interest, not the least because I am just now writing a short piece on 
the effect of the Bible on literacy in India. Of course, the introduction of the printing press into India (to ensure 
distribution of Indian language bibles) is one obvious route into this. But, are there specific discussions of how the 
protestant-educated Hindus may have seen the missionary emphasis on literary culture (meaning the Bible) as 
leading to a "new" valuation of the Indian "textual" tradition (by this I refer to both oral and written text), favoring the 
literary (in the sense of a "written" text)? I have collected some bits and pieces about this (especially Blackburn's 
work and Oddie's), but if there are specific studies available, I would appreciate hearing about them.

    Another significant aspect she might want to focus on is "textualism" by which I mean: 
    to conclude about the reality outside the texts, purely on the basis of words in the texts. 

    In other words apart from the connections /interface / comparison / study of relative 
    significance - between oral and written texts, a similar focus on connections /interface / 
    comparison / study of relative significance - between texts and the reality of life, rituals, 
    and other facts also needs to be taken up.

    Dear List members, 
    I am not sure if it is relevant to the topic at hand, but in the introductions of, 
    for instance, the Haracarita, Raghuva´sa and the Sanskrit plays the 
    respective authors of the texts play with the idea of live performances of 
    royal panegyric, va´sas and dramas (see my "On Beginnings: 
    Introductions and Prefaces in Kavya", in: Bronner-Shulman-Tubb, 
    Innovations and Turningpoints, Oxford-Delhi 2014, pp. 86-108).

    It is Lauri Honko, the Finnish Folklorist who uses the word 
    "textualization" in the sense of bringing an oral text into a 
    written form:

    Dear Indology mind-hive,

    I have an undergraduate student who is interested in writing a 
    paper on questions of oral and literary traditions. I would like to 
    solicit your opinions on potential sources for her. Please see 
    her message below for a more detailed delineation of her 
    questioning. 

    Many thanks in advance! 
    Mark


    Professor McLaughlin,

    I read through a little more of the Pollock book last night to get 
    a better feel for some questions. I think generally this is what 
    I'm thinking: 

    What is the difference and relationship between the oral and 
    literary tradition? How has that relationship evolved with the 
    emergence of written texts, vernacularization, and the 
    subsequent privileging of textual sources by the colonial West 
    and the Academy? Who is excluded and/or included by the 
    privileging of one kind of knowledge over the other? For 
    scholars, what kind of nuanced understanding of literacy 
    should be sought or acknowledged given that "to be literate" 
    can mean different things in different cultures? 

    Let me know if this sounds like what I was talking about the 
    other day! 

    Best,
    Emma
