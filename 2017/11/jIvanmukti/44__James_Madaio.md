Hi Patrick,


As you know this is a rather broad inquiry considering that *jīvanmukti* is
a term used across traditions in different ways.  Before it was used in
Advaita Vedānta it was employed in the non-dual Śaiva context and in the
*Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha*/*Mokṣopāya* (from where it may have made transit into
Advaita Vedāntin *sampradāya*s as a technical term [but not as a new
conceptual notion]).


Advaita Vedānta is not doctrinally uniform across time and space and, to
paraphrase Daya Krishna, all that is Advaita Vedānta is not Śaṃkara. It is
difficult therefore to speak across the whole tradition but I can say that
in the fourteenth century, Vidyāraṇya, in his *Jīvanmuktiviveka*, argues
that the *"jīvanmukta*" is precisely the one who has secured, stabilized or
safeguarded non-dual knowing (*jñānarakṣā*).  So, in this case, there are
no obstacles for the one who is called a *jīvanmukta*; however, there may
be potential obstacles for  knowers of *brahman* (but they are therefore
not yet considered *jīvanmukta*s).  Antecedents of this position—i.e., that
there may be obstacles for knowers—can be found in the commentarial works
of Śaṃkara, as noted here by Aleksandar.


The term *jīvanmukti*, of course, indicates something philosophically
different in other *vedānta* traditions, as well as in *haṭha* yogic,
*rasāyana*, and Nāth-Siddha texts, etc. This is, of course, to say nothing
of regional or vernacular traditions (some of which are advaitic in
orientation) where the term is also employed.


I have included here some references that engage with the issue of
*jīvanmukti* which may, in some cases, overlap with the notion of the
“perfected body.”  (I have not listed individually the interesting articles
in the excellent volume edited by Andrew Fort and Patricia Mumme).
