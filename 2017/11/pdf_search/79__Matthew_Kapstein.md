Dear friends,

I am seeking a pdf of J. Bronkhorst, "The Spread of Sanskrit," in From Turfan to Ajanta. Festschrift for Dieter Schlingloff on the Occasion of his Eightieth Birthday. Ed. Eli Franco and Monika Zin. Lumbini International Research Institute. 2010. Vol. 1. Pp. 117-139.

The author himself has uploaded a pre-publication version, but, as I wish to cite it, it will be necessary to
consult a copy of the print version to ensure that the pagination is correct.

with thanks, as ever,
for your generous assistance,

Matthew
