Dear All, 

I am writing on behalf of a colleague outside the field who is interested in avadhanam, the skill of performing multiple mental tasks at the same time. His interest is in the development of artificial intelligence and the neglect of the human intellect. He writes, "The narrative I'm trying to get at is that in this search of the new and shiny, ignoring and leaving behind the ancient and brainy is to our own collective peril; and that we would do well to democratize the art and skills of the likes of avadhanam before we create giant machine learning external brains.”

I have come across stray references to avadhanam, and I have encountered the occasional mention of it in current media, but I don’t know of scholarship about its historical development or practice. 

Any leads or citations on its practice new or old would be very much appreciated.

With thanks, 
Anna
