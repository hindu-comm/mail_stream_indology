AnnapurnaSIL (a Devanagari script font) version 1.203 is a maintenance
release that fixes some Graphite bugs involving reph position chaining
rules and a conjunct half-form. An OpenType rule for the "ra halant ra
halant" sequence was changed to match the Graphite rendering as reph over
ra-halant.

The home page is http://software.sil.org/annapurna/.
