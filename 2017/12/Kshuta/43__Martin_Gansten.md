I have been trying, so far without success, to understand the etymology 
of /kṣut/ or /kṣuta/ in the sense of 'bad, evil', used (in both 
variants) in some Sanskrit astrological texts. (I am fairly certain it's 
nothing to do with either sneezing or mustard!)

Searching for क्षुत, I found that Google Translate identifies it as a 
Hindi word meaning 'awkward', which seems promising; but GT is by no 
means infallible, and I haven't yet been able to locate the word in a 
Hindi dictionary. Could any Hindi-wallahs out there either confirm or 
deny its existence -- perhaps even throw light on its etymology?

Thanks in advance,
Martin Gansten
