Dear Colleagues,

My students are writing term papers for the South Asian mythology course.
One of them is writing on  MInAkSI and the Minakshi temple in Madurai;
another one is writing on the Gauri puja as performed in Maharashtra.
Could you please kindly recommend scholarly sources (books or articles) on
these two subjects suitable for the undergraduate students?

Many thanks and happy holidays,
Nataliya Yanchevskaya
Lecturer in Sanskrit, Princeton University
