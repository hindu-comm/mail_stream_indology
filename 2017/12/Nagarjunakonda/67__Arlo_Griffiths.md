Dear Daniela,


The book is still available for sale at the ASI. I know that not a single London library seems to own it, but shouldn't some effort be made to change this?


We made a scan in the framework of our Early Inscriptions of Āndhradeśa project, which I can share off list.

Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have the PDF of the second volume of the report on the excavations at Nagarjunakonda?

Soundararajan, K.V. (ed.) 2006. Nagarjunakonda (1954-60), Volume II (The Historical Period). New Delhi: Archaeological Survey of India (Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 75).

Thank you very much.

Best regards,

Daniela
