I have seen the following base-16 counting system in Bengali books, usually
as the numbering of the prefatory matter.  I've never seen any
secondary-source discussion of this.  One place to check might be Ifrah's
Universal History of Numbers;  Ifrah is wonderful in many ways, but is to
be used with caution in academic contexts.
