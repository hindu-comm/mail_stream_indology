Dear Colleagues,

Does anyone have an access to the following publication/paper:
*C. Margabandhu: "Ornaments of terracotta from Sisupalgarh â€“ a cultural
study", BHARATI, New Series No 3, 1985* (Chief editors: Lallanji Gopal,
Editors: Purusottam Singh, Thakur Prasad Verma).
*BHARATI, *bulletin of the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture
and Archaeology, published by Banaras Hindu University,Varanasi,
ISSN-0523-1302?

If so, would it be possible to have a copy of the paper? I would greatly
appreciate your help.
Unfortunately, I do not know the exact pagination of the paper.

With best regards,
Piotr Balcerowicz
