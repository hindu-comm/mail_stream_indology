Dear colleagues,


Prof. Bhattacharya used to be an active member of the list, but it has been a while since we last received a message from him, if memory serves me well.


I just tried to contact him using these addresses:

<bhrya at rediffmail.com>

<dbhattacharya2004 at yahoo.co.in>

My message was returned by both.


Does anyone have a working address for Prof. Bhattacharya, if he is not himself following the list any longer?


Best wishes,


Arlo Griffiths
