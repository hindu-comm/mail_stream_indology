Dear members,

Does anyone have S. Bhattacharyya's article "The Neo-Buddhistic Nucleus in
Alaṃkāraśāstra" from Journal of the Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, vol. 22 (1956)
pp. 49-66? The microfilm copy here at the university is too blurry. Thanks.

Best,

Alessandro Battistini
JSPS Fellow, Kyoto University
