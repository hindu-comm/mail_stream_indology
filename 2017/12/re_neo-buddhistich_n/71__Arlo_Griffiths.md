Dear Alessandro,


For many early volumes of the JASB, a precious digital resources is the Biodiversity Heritage Library. You may try if their coverage goes as far as 1956.


Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

Subject: [INDOLOGY] neo-buddhistic nucleus in alaṃkāraśāstra

Dear members,

Does anyone have S. Bhattacharyya's article "The Neo-Buddhistic Nucleus in Alaṃkāraśāstra" from Journal of the Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, vol. 22 (1956) pp. 49-66? The microfilm copy here at the university is too blurry. Thanks.

Best,

Alessandro Battistini
