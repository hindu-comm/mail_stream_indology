Thank you very much for this link which I could not - for whatever reason - locate myself!!!

I wonder, furthermore, if anyone on this list may have a pdf of the (Śrīmad)Appayyadīkṣitendravijaya, a text I encountered referenced in some secondary literature (Bronner 2014, in particular).

thanks a lot, 

best, 
Andrey

Here <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.496365> I found a digital version of one of the editions printed in Telugu script. I thought it was worth enquiring on the list before embarking on the study of Telugu. Thank you very much in advance!
