I suppose your student is interested in Navya Nyaya especially. Prof Dipak Bhattacharya who is in this list should be able to give names. Your student might also begin making contact with the Sanskrit depts.of Calcutta University, Jadavpur University and Visvabharati in Santiniketan.
Yours

Dear Friends, I have a student who is focused very intently on Nyāya and pramāṇavāda, who is getting ready to take his first trip to India to study with a traditional Pandit. Whom would people recommend especially for this discipline? I know of some Pandits who are all very capable in Nyāya, but I wonder if there are Pandits you might know of with an especial passion for the topic. Best,भवदीयः,J
