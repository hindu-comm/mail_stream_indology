Would anyone be able to identify the following śloka from the Tantravārttika of Kumārila? It could be from the 
Ślokavārttika as well, but the edition has a good index and this verse is not in it. The text simply identifies it as from the “bhaṭṭavārttika”. 

धर्मे प्रमीयमाणे हि वेदेन करणात्मना ।
इतिकर्तव्याभागं मीमांसा पूरयिष्यति ।। 


Thanks.

Patrick
