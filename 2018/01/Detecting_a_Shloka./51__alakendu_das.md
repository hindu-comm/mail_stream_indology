To All,While going through the chapter on MaddhyaCharya's DwaityaVada in SarvaDarshanSamgraha,I came across this sutra from a certain Purana-" Mahamayetwa Vidyeti Niyati Mohirniti cha,Prakriti PrakrshtaKaranaDwasana Basayeda yata ,A Ityaktwa Haristashya MayaVidyeti Sangitwa"        Can anybody kindly let me know the particular Purana- from which it is taken.Can it be the VishnuPurana?
           Alakendu Das.
