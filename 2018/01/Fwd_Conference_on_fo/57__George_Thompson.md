Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Conference on footprints, feet and shoes in Asian
Art, Bonn, April 2018
To: Julia Hegewald <julia.hegewald at uni-bonn.de>


Dear List,

I agree with colleagues who have welcomed this conference on footprints. I
wish that I could attend.  I have noticed, however, that there is no
reference among the conference papers to footprints in the Vedas.  If any
of you are interested in footprints in the Vedas, may I recommend to you
two papers that I wrote in 1995:

"The Pursuit of Hidden Tracks in Vedic", published in Indo-Iranian Journal,
vol. 38: pp. 1-30

"From 'footstep' to 'word' in Sanskrit", published in Semiotica, vol.
106-1/2: pp. 77-98.

"Semiotics" is the science of signs, and in this science there is much
literature on the footprint as a highly polyvalent sign.

Best wishes,

George Thompson
