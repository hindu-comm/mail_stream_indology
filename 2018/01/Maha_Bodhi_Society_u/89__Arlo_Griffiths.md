Dear Dhammadinna,


Could this be relevant?


Singh, Upinder. 2010. “Exile and Return: The Reinvention of Buddhism and Buddhist Sites in Modern India.” South Asian Studies 26 (2):193–217. https://doi.org/10.1080/02666030.2010.514744.


I am trying to attach the pdf (2.8 MB), hope it comes through.


Best wishes,


Arlo Griffiths

EFEO

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Maha Bodhi Society uposathagara/sima

Dear Friends and Colleagues,
does anyone have access to archival information or secondary sources on the history of the establishment, inauguration and historical use of the uposathagara/sima of the Sarnath centre of the Maha Bodhi Society?
Images (including contemporary) would also be most welcome.
With thanks in advance and all best wishes,
Dhammadinna
