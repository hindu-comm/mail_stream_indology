 Dear everyone,

I finished editing this book "Mahishasur: Mithak wa Paramparaye
(Mahishasur: Myth and Traditions)" towards the end of last year. The book,
which is a compilation of travelogues, essays, poems and even a play, has
now been released. The book is in Hindi but its English edition will be
available soon.

You could read about the book here:

paramparayen-published/

Anyone interested in reading about Indian mythology from a Bahujan
(non-brahmanical) point of view should find it useful.

It's also available on Amazon (both print version and e-book) here:
