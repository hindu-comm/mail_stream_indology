Oggetto: Masato Fujii's article


Dear colleagues,



does anybody have a copy of: Fujii, Masato. “The Bahiṣpavamāna Ritual of the Jaiminīyas”. Machikaneyama

Ronso (Philosophy), Vol. 20, pp. 3–25, 1986.

I'm struggling to find it and will be very thankful if you could help and share.



With thanks
Fabrizio Ferrari
