Alex, how about Ṛgveda 7.47, 7.49, 10.9, and various other stanzas?

Best,

Subject: [INDOLOGY] in praise of water

Dear List Members

A friend has asked if I could help him collect Sanskrit verses in praise of water.
He's not thinking so much of verses praising specific rivers, but water as such.
Does anything come to mind?

Yours Alex
