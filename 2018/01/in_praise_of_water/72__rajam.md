My posting may be ignored since it concerns Tamil, not Sanskrit!!

In Tamil we have a proverb: 

“tāyaip paḻittālum taṇṇīraip paḻikkātē (தாயைப் பழித்தாலும் தண்ணீரைப் பழிக்காதே)” 
meaning, “Don’t revile the water even if you revile your mother.” 

The well-known literature Tirukkuṟaḷ has a chapter on rain/water. 
Ancient Tamil poetry has some nice references in praise of water.
