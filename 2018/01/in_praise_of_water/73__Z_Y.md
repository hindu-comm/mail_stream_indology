Hi, Alex, my following study is somewhat relevant. More references are
found in the article.

Zhihua Yao, "One, Water, and Cosmogony: Reflections on the Ṛgveda X.129 and
the *Taiyi sheng shui*”. In Ithamar Theodor and Zhihua Yao (eds.)* Brahman
and Dao: Comparative Studies of Indian and Chinese Philosophy and
Religion* (Lexington
Books 2014), 3-18.

My posting may be ignored since it concerns Tamil, not Sanskrit!!

In Tamil we have a proverb:

“tāyaip paḻittālum taṇṇīraip paḻikkātē (தாயைப் பழித்தாலும் தண்ணீரைப்
பழிக்காதே)”
meaning, “Don’t revile the water even if you revile your mother.”

The well-known literature Tirukkuṟaḷ has a chapter on rain/water.
Ancient Tamil poetry has some nice references in praise of water.

Dear List Members

A friend has asked if I could help him collect Sanskrit verses in praise of
water.
He's not thinking so much of verses praising specific rivers, but water as
such.
Does anything come to mind?

Yours Alex
