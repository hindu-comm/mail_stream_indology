Dr. Krishnamurthi Ramasubramanian from the Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), Mumbai, India will spend three months as Visiting Professor at the Centre for the Study of Indian Science (CSIS), University of Copenhagen, starting in late April 2018.

As part of Dr. Ramasubramanian’s visit, CSIS will host a workshop, “Reading Jyotiḥśāstra Texts,” which will run from Monday, April 23, 2018 to Friday, April 27, 2018.

The workshop is open to anyone interested in reading and learning about Jyotiḥśāstra texts, that is, texts on the astral sciences and divination. No background in Jyotiḥśāstra is required, but a good understanding of Sanskrit is necessary to follow the discussion.

During the workshop, Dr. Ramasubramanian will discuss excerpts from three texts:

(1) The Siddhāntaśekhara of Śrīdhara, an astronomical treatise from the 11th century CE.
(2) The Karaṇapaddhati of Putumana Somayājin, an astronomical text from the 18th century CE.
(3) The Candrārki of Dinakara, a text of solar and lunar tables from the 16th century CE.

Anybody interested in the subject is welcome to attend the workshop.
