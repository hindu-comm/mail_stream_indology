Dear all;

I’m wondering if any list members might have information on the Koṇkanābhyudaya by Sāgararāmācarya. B.N.K. Sharma makes extensive use of it in his history of Mādhva Vedānta, but, as far as I can tell, makes no mention of bibliographic information or which manuscript libraries may hold copies of the text. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
