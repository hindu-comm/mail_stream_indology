Dear Professor Pinault, cher Georges-Jean,


There was a string on mirrors on INDOLOGY a few months ago. You can search the archive to find the relevant messages.


Avec mes meilleurs voeux pour 2018,

Dear all,



This announcement reminds me of an expression in the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha that I have difficulty understanding. On p. 418 of Abhyankar's edition (line 16.298) it mentions "showing a cloth with the imprint of the son's foot" (putrapadāṅkitapaṭapradarśanavat) in the context of announcing the birth of a son. Does this refer to a known custom in India?
