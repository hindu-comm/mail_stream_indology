Call for Papers:

The Navarātri Seminar is currently seeking submissions for the 2018 AAR meeting. As part of our mission we seek to study the festival of Navarātri from multiple geographical regions and historical periods and from a variety of methodological and theoretical perspectives. We, therefore, encourage papers that cover a range of traditions, regions, and languages in which Navarātri is celebrated.

The Navarātri Seminar only accepts single paper submissions.

Some themes identified as potential papers session topics at our last meeting were:

• Economies of Navarātri
• Spaces of Navarātri
• Different Religious Traditions’ Responses to Sacrifice in Navarātri
• Ornamentation and Navarātri
• Navarātri and Democracy
