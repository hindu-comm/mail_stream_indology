Many thanks to Dominik, who is very often the first one (and sometimes 
the only one) to react on mathematical-astronomical matters. Am I wrong 
or does the great majority of Indianists belong to the other "culture" 
(even if I don't believe in that separation) ? Known as "littéraire" in 
French speaking countries, the self-declared appartenance to that 
culture very often conceal a terror of maths, that I see at work every 
day as a math teacher.

Regards,

Dr Jean Michel Delire,
Professor of mathematics, Haute Ecole de Bruxelles-Brabant
Lecturer on Science and Civilization of India and on History of maths, 
University of Brussels
