I thought I might have asked the following question once before on this 
list, but can't find it in the archives, so perhaps I only intended to 
but never did:

In a couple of texts now, I have come across the expression 
/mathitārtha/, literally 'churned meaning', in phrases such as /iti 
mathitārthaḥ/ or /mathitārtho gurusampradāyāj jñeyaḥ/. I suppose it 
means something along the lines of innermost or final meaning, but I 
wonder if there is a more exact definition or explanation somewhere. 
Tubb and Boose's /Scholastic Sanskrit/ doesn't seem to have it. Any 
hints appreciated!
