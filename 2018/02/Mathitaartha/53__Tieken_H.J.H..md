Might there not be a relation between the idea of churning and that of pulverizing in the name of the so-called cūrṇi (Pkt cuṇṇi) commentaries to the Jaina canonical texts?.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Mathitaartha

I thought I might have asked the following question once before on this list, but can't find it in the archives, so perhaps I only intended to but never did:

In a couple of texts now, I have come across the expression mathitārtha, literally 'churned meaning', in phrases such as iti mathitārthaḥ or mathitārtho gurusampradāyāj jñeyaḥ. I suppose it means something along the lines of innermost or final meaning, but I wonder if there is a more exact definition or explanation somewhere. Tubb and Boose's Scholastic Sanskrit doesn't seem to have it. Any hints appreciated!
