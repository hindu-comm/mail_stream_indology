Dr.Gargeswari,
 Thank you very much for the information. In fact, previously I accessed Amazon.com ,where I found the book to be out of stock. However ,there I had a chance to see the Front Cover of the book, from where I got the Publisher' s name- Vivek Hamsa Prakasana, Bangalore. I accessed their site too, but found no mention of this particular book.Thus,as a last recourse, I thought if any PDF is available.I shall certainly get to the Adwaitya Asram site referred by you.Thank you once again.
RegardsAlakendu Das.

Please buy the book from this online store
http://www.advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami Tyagishanada

The book costs Rs 200.00 that would be less than $4.00.

I wonder why PDF of popular books that are printed by thousands should be shared . I understand if PDF of books which rare, out of print or not easily available in a particular country or library are shared.

Ajit Gargeshwari
