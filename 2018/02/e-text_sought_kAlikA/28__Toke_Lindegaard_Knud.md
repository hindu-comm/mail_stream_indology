Hi all,

According to this website

https://www.sites.google.com/site/bharatasahitya/archives

the Muktabodha Indological Research Institute at one point had an e-text of the Kālikākulapañcaśatikā, a.k.a. the Devīpaṅcaśatikā, edited by Mark S. G. Dyczkowski.

However, I can’t find this text at the Muktabodha website.

Would anyone happen to have a copy of this e-text?

Many thanks in advance.

All best wishes,
Toke
