Dear Harry,

I’ve written to Mark Dyczkowski—thank you for sending me his email address privately. Hopefully he can help. In the meantime I found that the text this link

https://www.scribd.com/document/87023764/devipancasatikaVELTHIUS

has a copy of the e-text. However, it’s behind a paywall.

All best,
Toke
