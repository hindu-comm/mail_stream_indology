Those who have visited the L.D. Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad might be interested to learn (and won't be surprised) that the architect who designed the building, Balkrishna Vithaldas Doshi, has won the Nobel Prize for architecture, the Pritzker Prize.
Doshi started his career with Le Corbusier in Paris, where he worked from 1950 to 1954. In the latter year he returned to India to take care of one of Le Corbusier's projects in Ahmedabad. The L.D. Institute is Doshi's first project as an independent architect.
