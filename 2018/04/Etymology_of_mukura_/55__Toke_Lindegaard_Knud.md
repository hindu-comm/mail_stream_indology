Hi all,

The two Sanskrit words mukura and makura both mean ‘mirror.’ I’m trying to understand their etymology.

Other meanings given in MW are ‘the stick or handle of a potter's wheel’ and ‘a bud, blossom.’ Turner’s _A Comparative Dictionary of the Indo-Aryan Languages_ connects the words to mukula and bakula, meaning ‘bud’ and ‘the tree Mimusops elengi,’ respectively. Burrow and Emeneau’s _Dravidian Etymological Dictionary_ (entry 4619), also connects the two words with  Mimusops elengi.

How did mukura and makura come to mean ‘mirror’ in Sanskrit?

Many thanks in advance.

All best wishes,
Toke
