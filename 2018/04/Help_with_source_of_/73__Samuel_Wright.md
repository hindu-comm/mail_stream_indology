Dear List,

I’m trying to track down the source of a quotation but not having much luck.

The quotation is “nityaṃ vijñānam ānandaṃ brahma”.

I’m inclined to read this as a variation of Brhadaranyaka Upanisad
(3.9.28): 'vijñānam ānandaṃ brahma....'

But, I’m wondering if the inclusion of ’nityam’ is found anywhere. The
texts in which I have encountered this quotation are all later than 1550 CE.

Many thanks,
Sam
