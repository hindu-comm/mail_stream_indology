It is indeed disturbing. The ICPR had at least 6 weeks to evaluate the conference (it was submitted to the ICPR, in part, I believe, to get funding). I found out the day before my flight. I understand from my colleagues at JNU that such cancelations and meddling is not very unusual. One JNU faculty member was not surprised and mentioned that "we are facing this kind of ridiculous censorship and suppression daily at the University.” The irony here, though, is palpable --xenophobia, nativism, and religio-poliical ideology preventing a conversion about Religion and Pluralism. I wonder how such an cancellation fits in with the prevailing political ideology of Hindutva and Hindu “tolerance” that they so merrily profess.

This is shameful.  The ICPR head, Prof. S. R. Bhatt, defended the decision with a series of transparently feeble arguments.
