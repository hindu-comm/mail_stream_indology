Here are my Krishna verses this morning:

वन्दारुजनमन्दार मुकुन्द तव वन्दनात् ।

अमन्दानन्दसन्दोहं विन्दे गोविन्द सत्पदम् ।।

Mandara tree for the people offering obeisance to you, O Mukunda, by
offering my obeisance to you, I attain a wonderful abode of infinite joy.


अनाहूतोऽपि गोविन्द महाचौर प्रतिक्षणम् ।

उद्घाट्य मे मनोद्वारं निर्भीको विशसे कथम् ।।

Though uninvited, O Govinda, you are a great thief who every moment opens
the door to my mind and enters without fear.


नानुजानाति कोऽपि त्वां निवारयति नैव वा ।

अदृष्टस्त्वं समागच्छन् प्रविष्टो हृदये कथम् ।।

No one allows you not stops you. Unseen while arriving, how did you enter
my heart?


निगूढो हृदये चौरोऽन्विष्ये तं कुत्र माधव ।

निष्कासितोऽपि हृदयान्नासौ निर्याति कर्हिचित् ।।

O Mādhava, the thief is hidden in my heart. Where shall I find him? Even
though expelled from the heart, he refuses to leave.


अथवा तिष्ठ यत्रासि मा गा अन्यत्र कुत्रचित् ।

लुण्ठितं सकलं स्वं मे, मान्येषां लुण्ठ माधव ।।

Or, just stay where you are, and don't go anywhere else. You have robbed me
of everything, now don't rob anyone else.


चोरितं यन्मदीयं स्वं तुभ्यमेव ददामि तद् ।

तथाप्याकाङ्क्षसे भूय: शिष्टं न मम किञ्चन ।।

Whatever you robbed of me, I just give it to you. Yet you want more. There
is nothing left with me.


कृष्ण एव महाचौरो निगूढो मम मानसे ।

कृष्ण एव मनोद्वारे रक्षार्थमवतिष्ठते ।।

This great thief, Kr̥ṣṇa, is hidden in my mind, and the same Kr̥ṣṇa stands
guarding at the gate of my mind.


दत्तं त्वया त्वयाऽऽदत्तं मदीयं नास्ति किञ्चन ।

इति ज्ञात्वा निरालम्बोऽवलम्बे तावकं पदम् ।।

Whatever was given by you, you took away, and nothing belongs to me.
Knowing this, I feel free and take refuge at your feet.


माधव त्वं महाचौरो यं प्रशंसन्ति लुण्ठिता: ।

अलुण्ठिताश्च याचन्ते लुण्ठ मां लुण्ठ मामिति ।।

O Mādhava, you are such a great thief, that even the robbed praise you.
Those who are not [yet] robbed beg you: “Rob me, rob me.”


अलौकिकस्त्वं चौरोऽसि सर्वस्वं चोरयन् मुधा ।

यदि सर्वं तवैवेदं चौर्ये ते किं प्रयोजनम् ।।

What a strange thief you are that you steal your own belongings. If all
that exists is yours, what is the point of stealing?
