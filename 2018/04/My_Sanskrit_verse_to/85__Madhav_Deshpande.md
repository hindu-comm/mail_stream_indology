My Sanskrit verse today:

कालिन्दीपुलिनेषु खेलनवशाद् यद्भालदेशे सदा
सञ्जाता: श्रमवारिबिन्दुपुलका मुक्ताद्युतिं तन्वते ।
यस्यानन्तगुणप्रभाविकिरणाद् विद्योतते भूतलम्
सोऽयं गोकुलवत्सलो विलसतां मन्मानसे सन्ततम् ।।

Playing on the banks of Kālindī, the drops of sweat on his forehead
produced by his exertion shine like pearls. The world itself shines by the
scattering light of his infinite virtues. May this love of Gokula
constantly shine in my mind.
