My Sanskrit verses this morning. This is a conversation between Krishna and
Rukmini:

प्रलपन्तं निशि स्वप्ने राधा राधेत्यनेकदा ।
प्रात: पृच्छति का केयं सचिन्ता रुक्मिणी हरिम् ।।
After Krishna often blurted the name of Rādhā at night in dream, the
worried Rukmiṇī asked him in the morning: "who is she?"

अपह्नुवानो राधाया: स्मरणं निजगाद स: ।
स्वप्नायमानेन मया व्याहृतं किञ्चिदक्षरम् ।।
Trying to hide the memory of Rādhā, he said: "I said some syllables while
dreaming."

रेति [र+इति] नाम तवैवैतद् धेति [ध+इति] चित्ते दधाम्यहम् ।
राधेति रुक्मिणीत्येव जपं कुर्वे दिवानिशम् ।।
"R is your own name, and Dh means I hold it in my mind. Day and night I
repeat the name of Rukmiṇī as Rādhā."

तच्छ्रुत्वा वचनं तुष्टा रुक्मिणी परिषस्वजे ।
हरिं सोऽपि च तां राधा राधेत्याह पुन: पुन: ।।
Having heard those words, Rukmiṇī was pleased and she embraced Krishna, and
he said to her the word Rādhā again and again.
