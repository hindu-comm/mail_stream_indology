About the book

*

This book is a complete annotated translation of a 9^th -century Tamil 
bhakti poetic work known as the /Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi/, by Kulacēkara Āḻvār, 
as well as of its medieval Śrīvaiṣṇava commentary in Sanskrit-Tamil 
Maṇipravāḷam by Periyavāccāṉ Piḷḷai (13^th c.). The /Perumāḷ Tirumoḻi 
/is now part of the Tamil Śrīvaiṣṇava canon called the /Nālāyira tivviya 
pirapantam /(/Nālāyira Divyaprabandham/, or ‘The Four Thousand Divine 
Compositions’), and is composed of ten decades dedicated to different 
forms of Viṣṇu. This book also includes an introduction, which seeks to 
find out who Kulacēkara Āḻvār really was, given his mysterious – and 
often disputed – identity.
