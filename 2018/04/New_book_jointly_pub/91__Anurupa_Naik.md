The /Karmapañjikā/ is a manual for the domestic rituals of the 
Paippalāda tradition. Claiming to follow a Sūtra of Paiṭhīnasi, the text 
was composed by an otherwise unknown Śrīdhara in Orissa in the 16th 
century CE. His work is a precious late-medieval witness to the 
Atharvavedic tradition, preserving archaic features dating from the 
Vedic period, but also showing much influence from various non-Vedic 
traditions that have been prevalent in this part of eastern India. The 
critical edition, which will be complete in three volumes, is based on 
six palm-leaf manuscripts written in Oriya script. This first volume 
contains an extensive introduction followed by the first nine chapters 
of text that describe the general paradigms of domestic ritual in this 
tradition.
