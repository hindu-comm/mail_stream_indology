Could it be analogical: yogī : yogi-  = sarasvatī : X- ?

This "sarasvatī", as well as "Bhāratī" is added in the title of many Sannyasins.  Sometimes I see the titles with a long "ī", and here is an instance of a short "i".  I am wondering as to what is the common practice and the grammar of that practice, especially since normally feminine expressions are being used in male titles.  Any suggestions?
