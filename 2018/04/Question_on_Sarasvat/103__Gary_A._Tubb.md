It also might be useful to know whether Southerners are involved, since in languages such as Telugu the final vowel would be shortened even in feminine names, and perhaps this might be inadvertently carried over into a name presented in Sanskrit.

This "sarasvatī", as well as "Bhāratī" is added in the title of many Sannyasins.  Sometimes I see the titles with a long "ī", and here is an instance of a short "i".  I am wondering as to what is the common practice and the grammar of that practice, especially since normally feminine expressions are being used in male titles.  Any suggestions?
