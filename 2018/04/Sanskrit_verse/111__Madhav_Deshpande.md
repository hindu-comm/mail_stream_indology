Reading the beautiful Sanskrit poems of Shankar Rajaraman, I am inspired to
write a verse of my own:

माधवं प्राप्य दुर्बुद्धे मा धाव तदनन्तरम् ।
कल्पवृक्षं समासाद्य किमेरण्डे प्रयोजनम् ।।
"O Dullard, having attained Mādhava [Krishna, Lord], don't keep on running
[mā dhāva] after that. Having found the wish-fulfilling tree, what is the
purpose in going after the caster-oil shrub?
