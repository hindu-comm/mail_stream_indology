Dear colleagues,


GRETIL does not seem to have any e-text for the Chandaḥśāstra.


Does anyone have an e-text of sūtras with/without commentary that can be shared?


I also have the impression that the files for Nāgārjuna's Ratnāvalī on GRETIL are not based on Hahn's edition and don't cover the 5th chapter. Does anyone have an e-text of the complete Ratnāvalī based on Hahn's edition?


Thank you.


Arlo Griffiths
