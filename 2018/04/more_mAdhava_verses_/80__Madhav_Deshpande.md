Here are some verses I composed this morning:


वादयसे मृदु वेणुं प्राणयसे लीलया जगद्यन्त्रम् ।

मा धावय मां माधव संसारे देहि विश्रान्तिम् ।।

O Mādhava, you play the flute softly and playfully enliven the wheels of
the world.  Don’t make me run around in the world.  Let me rest.


क्वणयसि मम हृदयस्थ: कर्षसि तन्तूनुदीरयसि वाचम् ।

माधव तव मधुरसमिह मधुशालायां पिबाम्यनिशम्।।

Sitting in my heart, O Mādhava, you play and pull strings and bring up my
voice.  In this wine-house [of your world] I constantly drink your sweet
nectar.


माधव तव मदिरेयं मधुशालेयं तवैव जगदीश ।

धृत्वा नाम तवाहं पानकर: पायकस्तथा चषक: ।।

O Mādhava, this wine is yours, and, O Lord, this house of wine is also
yours.  Bearing your name, I have become a drinker, the server and the cup.


त्वत्तो माधव जातस्त्वयि स्थितो लीन एव तव चरणे ।

उपधावामि त्वामिह यद्यपि दूरं न मत्तस्त्वम् ।।

O Mādhava, born from you, and standing in you, I rest at your feet.  I run
to you, even though you are not far from me.


माधव कोऽसि क्वासि त्वां जानेऽहं कथं नैकरूपम् ।

नटसि त्वं नाटयसे सर्वानस्मिन् जगद्रङ्गे ।।

O Mādhava, who are you and where are you?  How would I recognize you in
many forms.  On the stage of this world, you act and make all others act.


माधव सर्वत्र त्वं पुरत: पश्चात्तथापि गूढोऽसि ।

खेलसि लीलां धावसि धावयसेऽन्यान् मधुमिलिन्द ।।

O Mādhava, you are everywhere, in front and behind, and yet you are hidden.
O Honey-Bee, you are playing a game, you run and make others run.
