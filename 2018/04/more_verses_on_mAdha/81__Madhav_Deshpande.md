Here are some more verses on Mādhava this evening:

माधव तव वेणुस्वरमधुरसपानोत्सुको भवामि यदा ।

नेत्रे निमील्य पुरत: पश्यामि त्वां मनोहरमुदारम् ।।

O Mādhava, when I become anxious to drink the sweet nectar of the sound of
your flute, with my eyes closed, I see your beautiful and generous figure
in front of me.


गोकुलवासिजनानामश्रुजलैर्धौतपादयुगलोऽयम् ।

मथुरामयान्मुकुन्दो मा यातु कदापि मे हृदयात् ।।

This Mukunda left for Mathurā, with his feet washed with the tears of the
residents of Gokula.  May he never leave my heart.


माधव तव विरहातुरगोपीजनहृदयवेदनासदयम् ।

धावति मनो मदीयं त्वामन्वेष्टुं हरे जगति ।।

O Mādhava, my mind, compassionate with the heart aches of the milkmaids [of
Gokula] due to separation from you, runs around in the world to find you.


माधव निर्दय भवता मायापाशेन निर्जिता: सर्वे ।

नन्दन्ति पाशबद्धा मुक्ता इच्छन्ति तव बन्धम् ।।

O heartless Mādhava, you have conquered everyone with the bonds of your
Māyā.  Those who are caught in your bond delight, and those who are free
want to be bound.


त्वामन्वेष्टुं मुरहर धावामि कथं मनोवने निबिडे ।

सदय दयां कुरु माधव विश मे त्वरया मनोमुकुरे ।।

O Krishna, how can run around to find you in the thick jungle of my mind?  O
compassionate Mādhava, show mercy and quickly enter the mirror of my mind.
