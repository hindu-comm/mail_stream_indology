Dear Raffaele,

I mainly wished to correct “Bhāmaha” to "Udbhaṭa”. The other error, which pertains to transliteration, is even less significant. 

Best.

In fact, this would have been my second question: why practically in all modern Indic languages the words related to camatkāra mean “wonder, surprise, astonishment”, while it is not so with the Trika authors who introduced this word into philosophical-aesthetic terminology. Contrary to the communis opinio, I am convinced that the meaning of camatkāra in all Utpaladeva-Abhinavagupta-Kṣemarāja’s works has nothing (or at least very little) to do with ‘wonder’.
