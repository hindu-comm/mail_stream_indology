Dear colleagues,
only a final short note (along with my grateful thanks for the interesting suggestions, including those sent to me off-list by Roland Steiner and Christophe Vielle):

- I apologize to Ashok and Jesse for partly misrepresenting their comments.

- Nagaraj Paturi’s is precisely an apt statement of that communis opinio about the meaning of camatkāra I don’t agree on. But I am afraid that the Indology list (indeed a wonderful resource!) is not the right place to delve into complex philological investigations…

Warmly,
Raffaele

The suddenness and lack of its previous awareness (at a 'conscious' level ) leads to a surprise in the experiencing individual. Part of the ecstatic tingling or tingling ecstasy is characterised by this flash  and surprise aspect.

In fact, this would have been my second question: why practically in all modern Indic languages the words related to camatkāra mean “wonder, surprise, astonishment”, while it is not so with the Trika authors who introduced this word into philosophical-aesthetic terminology. Contrary to the communis opinio, I am convinced that the meaning of camatkāra in all Utpaladeva-Abhinavagupta-Kṣemarāja’s works has nothing (or at least very little) to do with ‘wonder’.
