I have a longer (42 pp.) article entitled "On ancient Indian ox-carts,
biers, beds and thrones: À propos of Sanskrit śakaṭī- / śakaṭa- and its
etymology" forthcoming shortly in: Indology's pulse: Arts in context (Doris
M. Srinivasan Festschrift), edited by Corinna Wessels-Mevissen and Gerd J.
R. Mevissen, New Delhi: Aryan Books International. There I discuss in
detail the contexts in which the word śakaṭa- occurs in Vedic and epic (and
selectively other Sanskrit)  literature. The following extract concerns the
Śulvasūtras:

Context XV: Carts and the shapes of brickbuilt

fire altars (citi). The Kātyāyana-Śulvasūtra

mentions a citi shaped like the triangular-shaped

‘mouth’ of a cart (1,18 śakaṭamukhasya caivam).

This is synonymous with the praüga-citis used in

rites of sorcery which are described in Āpastamba-Śulvasūtra

(12,4 praügaṃ cinvīta bhrātṛvyavān iti

vijñāyate ...), cf. the commentaries of Kapardisvāmin

(ed. Srinivasachar & Narasimhachar 1931: 202):

praügaḥ śakaṭapūrvabhāgaḥ, and Sundararāja (ibid.:

205): praügaṃ śakaṭasya mukhaṃ trikoṇaṃ tadvac

cīyata iti praügacit. In addition, the Āpastamba-Śulvasūtra

also describes a rhombus-shaped twofaced

praüga-citi for annihilating existing enemies

and those yet to be born (12,7 ubhayataḥpraügaṃ

cinvīta yaḥ kāmayeta prajātān bhrātṛvyān nudeya

pratijaniṣyamāṇān iti vijñāyate): it looks like two

carts/fore-parts of carts (joined together), with

their fronts facing different directions (12,8 yathā

vimukhe śakaṭe), cf. the commentaries of Karavinda

(ibid.: 208): vimukhe nānāmukhe śakaṭe yathā pṛṣṭhe

saṃhite tiṣṭhete tādṛgākārām ubhayatra praügaṃ

tathā cinvītety arthaḥ, and Sundararāja (ibid.: 209):

vimukhe viparyastamukhe prākpaścānmukhe yathā

śakaṭabhāge tādṛg eṣo ’gnir bhavati.
