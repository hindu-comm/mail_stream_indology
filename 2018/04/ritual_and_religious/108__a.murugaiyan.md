Dear colleagues,

A friend of mine working on the Tamil (old) diaspora would like to know 
whether there would be any text on the ritual and religious aspects of 
milk in Tamil if not in Sanskrit or other Indian languages. I would be 
thankful for any guidance or reference. The response may be addressed 
offline: a.murugaiyan at wanadoo.fr

Thank you in advance.
Sincerely

Appasamy Murugaiyan
