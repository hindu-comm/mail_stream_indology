Dear Colleagues:
Do we have a reliable text and/or translation of the Samaveda Mantra 
Brahmana/Chandogya Brahmana? I'm particularly interested in SMB.2.7, so 
any information on books or articles addressing this hymn would also be 
welcome. I'm struggling to find anything, but I may just be missing 
something obvious.

Cheers
JW
