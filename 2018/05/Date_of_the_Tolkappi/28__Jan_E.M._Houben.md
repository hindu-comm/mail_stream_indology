Dear Paniappan,
As an old student of Prof. Kamil Zvelebil and of his student Dr Saskia
Kersenboom I am not convinced that his translation is wrong or outdated.
Moreover, even with his translation you can argue that the imperative is
prescriptive for the first time.
In other words, his translation is here only cited as a "strawman" with the
WISH to attribute a more ancient date to the Tolkāppiyam.
Since, however, the most generally accepted etymogy of  Tolkāppiyam is "old
Kāvya" and since Kāvya has a convincing etymology from the Vedic-Old
Persian kaví this grammar was apparently composed or at least "named" after
Sanskrit Kāvya developed as a literary phenomenon. Which would match the
datings proposed by Prof. Tieken in his recently reprinted study on this
issue.
Best regards,
Jan Houben
