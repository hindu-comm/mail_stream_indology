Dear Jan,

I don't believe wwhat you say is true.

However, it is indeed an opinion current among those who have not read 
the Tolkāppiyam.

But if one reads the Tolkāppiyam, one will not find this explanation to 
make much sense.

My preferred explanation is the traditional explanation, current among 
native Tamil scholars, which derives the name from தொல்காப்பியக்குடி 
[tolkāppiyakkuṭi] which is the name of a clan (or gotra? or village?).

However,
life being short
and this topic having already been discussed on this very mailing list,
NINE years ago (in April 2009),
I shall leave it at that.

அன்புடன் [aṉpuṭaṉ]
