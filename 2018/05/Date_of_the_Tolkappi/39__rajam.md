It’s not just in the pāyiram (பாயிரம்), but in Iḷampūraṇar’s commentary also we find the word Tolkāppiyaṉ as the name of the author and Tolkāppiyam as the name of the book. 

Reference: Tolkappiyam, collatikāram, vēṟṟumai mayankiyal 33

For the benefit of all those who can read Tamil:

… தொல்காப்பியனாற் சொல்லப்பட்டது தொல்காப்பியம் …



>> Since the pāyiram is supposed to be produced at the beginning of a text’s existence, it is unlikely, the author would be named after the grammar at that stage. Then the question has to be changed to whether he could have been named after some exemplary kāvya he had authored before producing his grammar. That seems unlikely also since the author is only praised for his knowledge of Aintiram, a possible grammatical text and not a kāvya. It is high time we give up relating the name ‘Tolkāppiyam' to kāvya.
