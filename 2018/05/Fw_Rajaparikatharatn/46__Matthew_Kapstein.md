Dear Niranjan,


The title is actually RatnAvali and the later Michael Hahn's edition is available here:

http://www.iet-verlag.de/


I do not know if there is an e-text of his edition available, however.


The version given in the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon is quite outdated (derived from Vaidya's reedition of Tucci's edition), but may be accessed here:

http://www.dsbcproject.org/canon-text/book/233


I believe that some additional may have appeared in recent years, but I cannot locate the references just now (or perhaps my memory about this is in error).

Dear List,

Might anybody could let me know of the availability of e-copy of the Rajaparikatharatnamala of Nagarjuna.



With regards,
