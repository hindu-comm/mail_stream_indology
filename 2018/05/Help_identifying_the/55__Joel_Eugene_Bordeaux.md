While we’re at it, does anyone know of sources exploring the theoretical basis for or historical development of these ‘gayatris’? 

For example, in what sense is the mantra below a ‘gayatri’ beyond containing the verbs dhīmahi and pracodayāt? Is there any relation postulated between the 'gayatris' of Kubera etc. and Gayatri as a goddess? 

 With thanks,
J.
