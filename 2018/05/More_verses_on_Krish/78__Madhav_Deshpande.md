Here are further verses on Krishna and Tarkika:

The Logician says:

यदि जह्यामहं तर्कं कर्णधारं मतेर्मम ।

अपथे गमनादेनामनर्थात्को निवारयेत़् ।।

If I give up my logic, which has been the guide of my intelligence, then
who will prevent it from going astray and from a disaster?


Reply:

रथे पार्थस्य गोविन्द: सारथित्वेन वर्तते ।

कथं तस्य रथो गच्छेदपथे कथयस्व मे ।।

Govinda himself is the driver on the chariot of Arjuna.  Tell me how his
chariot can go astray.


कुरु तं सारथिं सद्यस्तार्किक स्वे मनोरथे ।

अपथे गमनादेष वारयेत् करुणाकर: ।।

O Logician, instantly make him the driver of the chariot of your mind.  That
Ocean of Compassion will prevent it from going astray.


यदि नौकर्णधारस्ते भूयात्स मधुसूदन: ।

अपारे खलु संसारे पारयेत् त्वां सुनिश्चितम् ।।

If Kr̥ṣṇa were to become the guide of your ship, he will most certainly
take you across the formidable ocean of life.


न ते तार्किक पर्याप्तस्तर्को ज्ञातुं परं पदम् ।

नारिकेलफलग्राही नोद्बाहुरपि वामन: ।।

O Logician, your logic is incapable of knowing the highest abode.  A dwarf,
even if he raises his arms, is incapable of getting the fruit of a coconut
tree.


तर्कातीतं पदं वेत्तुं यदि तर्कोऽबलो भवेत् ।

न तत् क्षिणोति तर्कस्य यशस्ते विषयान्तरे ।।

If your logic is insufficient to know the abode that is beyond logic, that
does not take away the success of logic in other areas.


ततस्तार्किक मा भूयात् खेदस्ते स्वमतेर्बले ।

तर्क: क्रीडनकं तेऽस्तु न मनोरथसारथि: ।।

Therefore, O Logician, don’t be depressed about the ability of your logic.  Let
your logic be your toy, but not the driver of the chariot of your mind.


मनोरथानामगतिर्यस्मिन् विष्णो: परे पदे ।

माधव: सारथिर्भूत्वा तत्र नेष्यति ते रथम् ।।

The chariots of mind do not reach that highest abode of Viṣṇu, but Mādhava
can become the driver of your chariot of your mind and take it there.


अलमेतेन वादेन तपस्विन् तार्किकोत्तम ।

श्रुत्वा माधवसौहार्दं यथेच्छसि तथा कुरु ।।

Enough of this debate, you poor soul, the best among logicians.  After
hearing about the friendship of Mādhava, you act as you please.


गच्छ तार्किक भद्रं ते ब्रूया ईशो मया हत: ।

ईशतार्किकयोरत्र वयं विद्मो बलाबलम् ।।

Go your on way, O Logician.  May you be fine.  Proclaim that you killed God.
But we know the relative strength of God and Logician.
