Dear Dan,


The RatnAvali became the RAjaparikathAratnamAlA owing to a calque from the Tibetan, that was followed before the actual Skt. became known. It is not widely recognized that many of the "Sanskrit" titles given in the Kanjur and Tanjur are in fact calques of this kind, Tibetan back translations that are not derived from the Indic originals. In this case, the Tibetan is

Dear Matthew,

And the Rājaparikathā- is not the Ratnamālā. Just trying to cover all the bases.

Do you mean the ayurvedic/magical text, Yoga Ratnamālā, attributed to Nāgārjuna?

If so, there is a hardcopy version, with the 140 Sanskrit verses (in devanagari) and an English translation, accompanied by a Sanskrit commentary by Jain MUni Shri Gunakara called Laghu Vivṛtti.

Pushpendra Kumar, Nagarjuna’s Yogaratnamala, Delhi: Nag Publishers, 1980.

I don’t know of an e-version.
