I would like to locate a photo of Prof R. C. Zaehner, whose lectures I
attended in 1974, just before his demise.  Does anyone have one?  I've
scoured the internet without luck.  I think maybe he was not photographed
much because he had been a spy before he became a professor of eastern
religions.

The photo that often crops up
<https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/images/people/western_writers/zaehner.jpg>
for Zaehner when one does a Google search isn't him (it's Max Muller).

Best wishes,
Dominik
