Dear Lubomír,

Many thanks for taking the time to answer my query in such detail. It is 
greatly appreciated.

I had a quick look at the Svopajñavivaraṇa commentary on YŚ V.61-9 which 
describe the three main nāḍīs (iḍā, piṅgalā, suṣumṇā), but did not find 
any mention of further nāḍīs or dvāras. I will have to look more closely 
at other passages as well, but as you mentioned yourself it does not 
seem to include a more developed system of nāḍīs.

I might also add that about half of the approximately sixty Jain gyān 
bāzī charts included in my analysis features a verse describing them as 
"the game of the nameless brahman" (anāmat brahm kī bājī) which seems to 
indicate outside (possibly Nāth) influence.

Once again, thank you so much.

Best regards,
Jacob
