Dear Palaniappan,


The recognition of true historical background of the Prabodhacandrodaya and the references to this contained within the play itself offer a case in point. I have discussed this in my introduction to my translation of the work, which is available here:

No doubt others will be able to bring up other examples.


best,

Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Epigraphy and Indology

Dear Scholars,

While many epigraphists have been Indologists who used literary texts to inform and correct epigraphic data, I would appreciate references to scholarly works in the other direction, i.e., the use of epigraphical data to inform and correct interpretations of literary texts.

Thanks in advance

Regards,
Palaniappan
