Dear list members,

does anyone have access to the issue of the Journal Maha Bodhi 52-54 
from 1944? Page 84(f?) contains a review of Surya Narayana Caudhari's 
book Aśvaghoṣakṛta Buddhacarita, if I am not mistaken. I would be 
very grateful for a link to or a PDF of this review.

Thanks a lot,
Christian Ferstl
