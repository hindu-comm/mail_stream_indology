History of Philosophy), Oxford University Press, 352 pages, 978-0198732662

Here is a short description, followed by the table of contents:

Jan Westerhoff unfolds the story of one of the richest episodes in the
history of Indian thought, the development of Buddhist philosophy in the
first millennium CE. He starts from the composition of the Abhidharma
works before the beginning of the common era and continues up to the time
of Dharmakirti in the sixth century. This period was characterized by the
development of a variety of philosophical schools and approaches that have
shaped Buddhist thought up to the present day: the scholasticism of the
Abhidharma, the Madhyamaka's theory of emptiness, Yogacara idealism, and
the logical and epistemological works of Dinnaga and Dharmakirti. The book
attempts to describe the historical development of these schools in their
intellectual and cultural context, with particular emphasis on three
factors that shaped the development of Buddhist philosophical thought: the
need to spell out the contents of canonical texts, the discourses of the
historical Buddha and the Mahayana sutras; the desire to defend their
positions by sophisticated arguments against criticisms from fellow
Buddhists and from non-Buddhist thinkers of classical Indian philosophy;
and the need to account for insights gained through the application of
specific meditative techniques. While the main focus is the period up to
the sixth century CE, Westerhoff also discusses some important thinkers
who influenced Buddhist thought between this time and the decline of
Buddhist scholastic philosophy in India at the beginning of the thirteenth
century. His aim is that the historical presentation will also allow the
reader to get a better systematic grasp of key Buddhist concepts such as
non-self, suffering, reincarnation, karma, and nirvana.
