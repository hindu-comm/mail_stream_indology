I generally find it best, especially at the early stages of Sanskrit
learning/teaching, to avoid equating grammatical terms from different
systems. Most of the Sanskrit terms are fairly precise, whereas there is
often some variation in the definitions for Latinate terminology and the
two don't often match up exactly. Plus, to be accurate one often ends up
going on long tangents.

The technical terms sārvadhātuka and ārdhudhātuka and the results of being
so termed are very interesting as well as complex. I'm not sure how far we
can associated the stem to which sārvadhātuka suffixes are added with what
is commonly termed the present stem. Since all of the personal endings are
termed sārvadhātuka (tiṅśit sārvadhātukam), sārvadhātuka suffixes occur
with all of the tense stems.   The vikaraṇas, many of which are associated
with the class signs used to build the present stem, are not universally
termed sārvadhātuka either; u of the tanādi gaṇa (3.1.79) is ārdhadhātuka
(it's not marked with Ś) and hence is not ṅit by P. 1.2.4 sārvadhātukam
apit. Consequently there is guṇa-strengthening in karoti from √ kṛ (ḌUkṛÑ)
when u follows but not in sunoti from √ su (ṣuÑ) when Śnu follows (Śnu,
being treated a marked with Ṅ by P. 1.2.4 and hence blocking
guṇa-strengthening according to P. 1.1.5 kṅiti ca). In any case, this can
get a bit complicated quickly, so it might be best to treat each set of
terms separately and not look for one to one correspondences.

Could a reference be given to Max Müller's translation? It doesn't
immediately come to mind.

All the Best,
Victor
