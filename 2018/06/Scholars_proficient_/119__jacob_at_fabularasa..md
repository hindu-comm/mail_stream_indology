Dear all,

I'm looking for someone proficient in 19th-century Rajasthani dialects 
to help identify the language in a verse on a gyān caupaṛ chart from the 
Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum in Jaipur. I thought that I would 
start here as this diverse and learned group might have a few obvious 
suggestions up their sleeve.

Kind regards,
Jacob
