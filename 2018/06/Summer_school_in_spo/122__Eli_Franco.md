Dear friends and colleagues,

There are a few places left for the summer school in spoken Sanskrit  
in Leipzig (3rd to 30th of August).
For details please see

I would be grateful if you could convey this information to potential  
participants.

Please note that this year we also have an advanced summer school in  
spoken Sanskrit in September (open to those who completed the regular  
course or have similar qualifications); see:

With best wishes,
Eli
