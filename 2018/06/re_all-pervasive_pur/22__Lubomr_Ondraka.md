Dear Johannes,

thanks for this, of course I know all the papers from this conference, including this yours. It deals with the fundamental problem whether we should understand the teaching of classical Sāṃkhya more as a cosmogony or individual anthropogony. Preferably both, but then serious inconsistencies would arise.

I understand that in the light of this crucial question my problem with the all-pervasive puruṣa is a minor one, but not being a Sāṃkhya specialist, I might overlook something important, so that is why I put my question to this forum.

All the best,
Lubomir

Sure, it might reflect some older teaching that survived outside the Sāṃkhya mainstream. But the question whether each puruṣa is all-pervasive all the time or only when liberated seems to me rather crucial. All commentaries apparently take it for granted that puruṣas are all-pervasive all the time, only Jayamaṅgalā for some reason distinguishes between liberated and non-liberated puruṣa. This puzzles me.

I cannot answer the question of my students how could puruṣa (who is absolutely passive etc.) change itself so dramatically? And where does this concept occur in classical Sāṃkhya? Could you please help me with these answers? I am not a specialist in Sāṃkhya, we have this seminar just for fun, so I probably missed something in Sāṃkhya teaching on puruṣa. I promised to my students that I will ask this learned forum to get the right answers.
