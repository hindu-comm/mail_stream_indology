Hello Lubomíre,

Even though your initial inquiry is about Sāṅkhya ontological questions, we can draw from some of the epistemological material of the YD, which shows that puruṣa has no connection with vyakta, such as instruments/faculties engaged in the operation of acquiring knowledge. See YD on SK 36 (Wezler/Motegi edition), p. 223, l.1ff. 

tayā cādhyavasāyarūpāpannayā cetanāśaktir anugṛhyate. na karaṇāntarasya puruṣeṇa sambandho ’sti…

The intellect acquired the form of non-doubting awareness (adhyavasāya) having accepted the conscious power/power of consciousness. There is no connection/bond of an internal instrument with the unintentional consciousness (puruṣa)… 

 Of course, there is more to be said.

A little note: I would like to suggest that sometime we need to play a little with the way how we choose translating: viparyāsa, viparīta, etc., which may be understood as “contrast” and not necessarily “opposite.”    

Edeltraud Harzer. 

PS Jayamaṅgalā is suspected sometime that there might be other influences.

Sure, it might reflect some older teaching that survived outside the Sāṃkhya mainstream. But the question whether each puruṣa is all-pervasive all the time or only when liberated seems to me rather crucial. All commentaries apparently take it for granted that puruṣas are all-pervasive all the time, only Jayamaṅgalā for some reason distinguishes between liberated and non-liberated puruṣa. This puzzles me.

I cannot answer the question of my students how could puruṣa (who is absolutely passive etc.) change itself so dramatically? And where does this concept occur in classical Sāṃkhya? Could you please help me with these answers? I am not a specialist in Sāṃkhya, we have this seminar just for fun, so I probably missed something in Sāṃkhya teaching on puruṣa. I promised to my students that I will ask this learned forum to get the right answers.
