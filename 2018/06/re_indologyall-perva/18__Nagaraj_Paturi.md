Dear Lubomir-ji,

avyāpi vyaktam, vyāpy avyaktam / puruṣo'pi vyāpī yadā prakṛtyā muktaḥ /
yuktaś cet vyaktena sadṛśo  na pradhānena / hi sarvadā devādiṣu pravartate /

yadā prakṛtyā muktaḥ is just solving a logical problem.

As long as  puruṣa is bound with  prakṛti, it has the features of prakṛti.
Since  prakṛti is  avyāpi ,   as long as  puruṣa is bound with  prakṛti ,
puruṣa  is also avyāpi. But being  vyāpi  is the nature of   puruṣa . When
is this nature  puruṣa found? When it is not bound to  prakṛti .
