I would like to mention two points regarding the Śvetāmbara Jain 
canonical texts ( Anandsagarsuri) at Jain eLibrary:

1. I opened one .docx-file: there is no searchable Unicode text but just 
pictures from the manuscripts.

2. The most important sources are still the Cūrṇis, since they are 
written in Prakrit without Sanskrit commentary and supposed to be one or 
two centuries earlier written down than Haribhadra's Vṛttis 
(=Anandasagarsuri's edition). Cūrṇis are not included in the 
Anandasagarsukri-Edition. Or did I miss them?

Best

Heiner
