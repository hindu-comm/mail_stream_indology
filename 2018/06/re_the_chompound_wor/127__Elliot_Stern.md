Vyomaśivaḥ (no later than the first half of the 10th century) says at the end of the karmapadārthaḥ section: mahābhūtānāṃ bhūgolakadevakulādīnāṃ prakṣobhaṇaṃ tatkampanam | (padārthadharmasaṅgrahaṭīkā 2.268.3 in Gaurīnāthaśāstri’s edition).

However, the word "bhūmaṇḍal̥a" is used in the work of Rāmadāsa in the 17th century: "समर्थाचिया सेवका वक्र पाहे असा सर्व भूमंडळी कोण आहे."  "Maṇḍaḷa" and "Gola" are also used in Marathi in conjunction with Sūrya.

>>  (a) Mokṣopaya (10th century) has dharāgola and bhūgola (Roland Steiner kindly helped me with the references from this work)
>>  (b) Tattvacintāmaṇi (12th century)
>>  (c) Nyāyasudhā (14th century)
>>  (d) Saṃkhyasūtravivaraṇa (a late commentary)
>> 
>> (3) The Gopālatāpanyupaniṣad (13th century or later) uses the compound word bhūgolacakra.
>> 
>> (4) The Gītagovinda (12th century) uses the compound word once.
>> 
>> (5) The Harivaṃśa uses it in one verse (a star-verse).
>> 
>> (6) Some Bengal Vaiṣṇava works use the compound word; for example, the Gopālacampū of Jīva Gosvāmin (16th century) uses bhūmigola once; Rūpa Gosvāmin (16th century) uses the compound word as well.

>> Does any of you know of other instances of the compound word bhūgola outside of the astronomical tradition? I’d greatly appreciate learning of instances I’ve missed.
