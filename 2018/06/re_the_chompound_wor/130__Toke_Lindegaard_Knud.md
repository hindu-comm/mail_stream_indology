Dear Madhav,

Thank you for sending me this interesting text. Vādirāja certainly doesn’t use the word bhūgola in the sense of ‘the earth’s sphere,’ a spherical earth at the center of the universe. I’m wondering what bhūgola means to him. The text goes beyond a description of terrestrial geography and includes, for example, a description of the region of the stars (nakṣatragati; starting in verse 320) and a description of the various layers of the shell of the brahmāṇḍa is found toward the end of the text (starting in verse 345).

I wonder if Vādirāja means the entire brahmāṇḍa when he uses the word bhūgola?

I see that Vādirāja is a 16th-century Dvaita follower of Madhva.

Regarding the occurrences of bhūgola in the works of Rūpagosvāmin and Jīvagosvāmin, I agree that they probably go back to earlier uses of the word in texts they rely on. Going further, I wonder if their use of the word, along with the occurrences of the word in the Gītagovinda and the Gopālatāpanī-upaniṣad, can all be explained by the reliance of these texts and authors on the Bhāgavatapurāṇa (which uses the word five times)?

All best wishes,
Toke

However, the word "bhūmaṇḍal̥a" is used in the work of Rāmadāsa in the 17th century: "समर्थाचिया सेवका वक्र पाहे असा सर्व भूमंडळी कोण आहे."  "Maṇḍaḷa" and "Gola" are also used in Marathi in conjunction with Sūrya.
