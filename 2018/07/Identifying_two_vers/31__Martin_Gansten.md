At the end of an astrological MS, available to me only in digitized 
microfilm format, are two partly illegible verses which appear to be 
(part of?) a poem on spring, and nothing to do with astrology at all. 
The first half-stanza runs:

rājan vasantasamaye vada kiṃ tarūṇāṃ kiṃ kṣīyate virahiṇām uragaḥ kim eti |

If any rasikas on the list recognize it and are able to supply the rest 
of this and the following verse, I should be very grateful.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
