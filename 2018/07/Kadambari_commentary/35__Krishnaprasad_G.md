Dear all
I want to know the details (Mss, or published whereabouts) of commentary by
Sripati, on Kadambari.

I found this name referred by Sri Haridasa Siddhanta Vagisha on  Kadambari
Purvabhaga By Mahakavi Sri Banabhata.

Why am I searching ?
To Publish the work because
Sripati's commentary seems to be more rational than Bahnuchandra


For instance in Kadambari
भगवतो नारायणस्यानुकरोति
Here Bahnuchandra says the genetive case ending according to कृञः
प्रतियत्ने which is very far from the context. Where as Sripati says
संबन्धसामान्ये षष्ठी otherwise which actually had taken accusative

Thanks
