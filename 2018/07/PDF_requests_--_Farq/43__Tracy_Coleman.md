Dear Indologists,


I am seeking PDFs of the following works before I try ordering them via interlibrary loan:


Farquhar, JN. An Outline of the Religious Literature of India. London: OUP, 1920.


Sharma, BNK. A History of the Dvaita School of VedƒÅnta and Its Literature.  Vol. 2.  Bombay: Booksellers' Publ. Co., 1961 (or 1962?).


Thank you,


Tracy Coleman

Colorado College
