Dear Tracy,

Both are available on archive.org (Sharma at https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfDvaitaSchoolSharmaBNKVol2 and Farquhar at https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.224306).

Generally speaking, archive.org is a wonderful resource, but you have to be a bit patient and creative with search terms since they are inconsistently catalogued/tagged (I find that minimal works better, such as author last name and a couple keywords from the title)

My best,

Steven

Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF requests -- Farquhar and BNK Sharma


Dear Indologists,



I am seeking PDFs of the following works before I try ordering them via interlibrary loan:



Farquhar, JN. An Outline of the Religious Literature of India. London: OUP, 1920.



Sharma, BNK. A History of the Dvaita School of VedƒÅnta and Its Literature.  Vol. 2.  Bombay: Booksellers' Publ. Co., 1961 (or 1962?).



Thank you,



Tracy Coleman
