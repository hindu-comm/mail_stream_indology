Dear Friends, The *Bhaṭṭikāvya* has an especially recherché verb form in
2.35: '*vyatiste*'. Both Jayamaṅgalā and Mallinātha understand it as 'as'
ātmanepada, emphatically illustrating Pāṇini 1.3.14 (*kartari
karmavyatihāre*). The rākṣasa Mārīca has just said that killing brahmins is
his dharma, and that he is not allowed to follow a Vedic lifestyle. Rāma
responds that his own dharma contrasts, namely to kill him in turn [see
below], i.e. reciprocity of action. Whitney seems to think he has seen an
ātmanepada form of 'as' 3 pl. 'asate' in the Mahābhārata somewhere, but I
can't locate it. Here is the *Bhaṭṭikāvya* verse:

*dharmo ‘sti satyaṃ tava rākṣasāyam anyo vyatiste tu mamāpi dharmaḥ/*

*brahmadviṣas te praṇihanmi yena rājanyavṛttir dhṛtakārmukeṣuḥ//* (2.35)

My question=has anyone ever come across a comparable form?

Thanks as always, bhavadīyaḥ,J
