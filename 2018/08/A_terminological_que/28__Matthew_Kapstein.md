Dear Artur,


The term "hyperglossia," as introduced by Pollock in his

The Language of the Gods in the World of Men,

refers to this phenomenon, though I am not sure how widespread this usage is. Pollock seems to have treated it as a neologism.


If I understand just what you are talking about, James Strachey's translations of Freud -- e.g. his rendering of "das Ich" as "the ego" -- may serve as a modern example. You may therefore find other terms for what you are looking for by digging into the critical literature on Strachey's translations.


good luck,

Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] A terminological question

Dear List,

[From my main e-mail address]

In my work with the Pali works - original texts and their translations - I come across traces of a peculiar practice.

The translators tend, not infrequently, to supplant plain, ordinary, common terms with their more elegant, subtler lexical equivalents.

There is a Greek/Latin term for this practice - but I cannot recall it.

May I count on your help re?
