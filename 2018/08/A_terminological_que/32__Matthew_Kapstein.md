Dear Birgit,


Yes, perhaps I had in mind the way in which Pollock's usage has been extended in subsequent scholarship. E.g., Ashley Thompson, "Engendering the Buddhist State," pp. 32-36, "Hyperglossia and the DevarAja," where it is a question, within Khmer usage, of the replacement of indigenous Khmer names and terms with Sanskrit equivalents. And I think this sort of thing was Artur's concern.


And I don't believe that Pollock's usage excluded this extension.


Matthew

Pollock uses "hyperglossia" for a relationship between languages, though, as a special hierarchical case of diglossia, not for describing individual acts or habits of linguistic choice (which seems to be what the original question was after).

I don't recall that Pollock limits it to translation. And it definitely refers to moving from a "lower" to a "higher" linguistic register, which is not quite what we mean by "euphemism".

Does Prof. Pollock use it in the context of translation only?

If it is general context of semantic change, 'euphemism' has similarity with this, except that the replaced word refers to an 'obscene', 'inauspicious', 'unparliamentary' meaning hence is considered to be crude or explicit usage.

Dear Artur,


The term "hyperglossia," as introduced by Pollock in his

The Language of the Gods in the World of Men,

refers to this phenomenon, though I am not sure how widespread this usage is. Pollock seems to have treated it as a neologism.


If I understand just what you are talking about, James Strachey's translations of Freud -- e.g. his rendering of "das Ich" as "the ego" -- may serve as a modern example. You may therefore find other terms for what you are looking for by digging into the critical literature on Strachey's translations.


good luck,

Matthew

Dear List,

[From my main e-mail address]

In my work with the Pali works - original texts and their translations - I come across traces of a peculiar practice.

The translators tend, not infrequently, to supplant plain, ordinary, common terms with their more elegant, subtler lexical equivalents.

There is a Greek/Latin term for this practice - but I cannot recall it.

May I count on your help re?
