Dear Prof. Lusthaus,

A greatly impressive show of truly impressive erudition - demonstrated by
selecting & quoting the equally erudite inputs of the MPS commentators *re*
kammāraputta and sūkaramaddava.

Nothing to add from my side.

However - the question of the basic question, and that is: how to call the
practice of making the translated texts as elegant as possible? Of - sort
of - beautifying them? Even at the cost of losing some of their original
meaning/purpose?

Hyperglossia - as suggested by Matthew Kapstein?

Artur Karp

> 1. Cunda.– A worker in metals (kammāraputta) living in Pāvā
> <http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/pava.html>. When the Buddha reached Pāvā on
> his way to Kusinārā, he stayed in Cunda’s Mango grove. There Cunda visited
> him and invited him and the monks to a meal the next day. The meal
> consisted of sweet rice and cakes and tender pork (sūkaramaddava). At the
> meal the Buddha ordered that he alone should be served with sūkaramaddava,
> and that what was left over should be buried in a hole. This was the
> Buddha’s last meal, as very soon after it he developed dysentery (D.ii.126;
> Ud.viii.5). The Buddha, a little while before his death, gave special
> instructions to Ānanda that he should visit Cunda and reassure him by
> telling him that no blame at all attached to him and that he should feel no
> remorse, but should, on the contrary, rejoice, in that he had been able to
> give to the Buddha a meal which, in merit, far exceeded any other (D.ii.135
> f).
>
> The Suttanipāta <http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/suttanipata.html> Commentary
> (SNA.i.159) mentions that, at this meal, Cunda provided golden vessels for
> the monks’ use; some made use of them, others did not. One monk stole a
> vessel and put it in his bag. Cunda noticed this but said nothing. Later,
> in the afternoon, he visited the Buddha and questioned him as to the
> different kinds of recluses (samaṇa) there were in the world. The Buddha
> taught him the Cunda Sutta <http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/cunda_sutta.html>.
>
>
> The Commentary adds (p.166; also UdA.399) that Cunda reached no
> attainment, but merely had his doubts dispelled. The Dīghanikāya
> Commentary, however, says (DA.ii.568) that he became a Stream-winner at the
> first sight of the Buddha and built for him a vihāra at the Ambavana.
> This latter incident, probably, took place at an earlier visit of the
> Buddha, for we are told (D.iii.207) that while the Buddha was staying in
> Cunda’s Mango grove, he was invited by the Mallas to consecrate their new
> Mote-hall, Ubbhataka. He accepted the invitation, taught in the hall until
> late at night, and then requested Sāriputta to continue, which he did by
> teaching the Saṅgīti Sutta. This was soon after the death of Nigaṇṭha
> Nāṭaputta <http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/vipassi_buddha.html> (D.iii.210).
>
> The Aṅguttaranikāya <http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/anguttara_nikaya.html>
> (v.263 ﬀ) mentions another conversation between the Buddha and Cunda. Cunda
> tells the Buddha that he approves of the methods of purification
> (soceyyāni) laid down by the brahmins of the west (Pacchābhūmakā
> <http://www.aimwell.org/DPPN/p.html#Pacchabhumaka>). The Buddha tells him
> of the teaching of the Noble Ones regarding the threefold defilement and
> purification of the body, the fourfold defilement and purification of the
> speech, and the threefold defilement and purification of the mind. Cunda
> accepts the Buddha’s explanations and declares himself his follower
> —
> The SNA introduces the “gold” side story.
>
> As for the term sūkara-maddava
>
> sūkara = pig,
> maddava = soft & tender (said of food taken by young women to preserve
> their good looks) DhsA 403 [from mudu, cf. PTS Pali-Eng Dict. p, 537]
>
> Likewise in SKT: sūkara = a boar, hog, pig, swine
>
> Cf. MW:
> sūkaragṛha = sū-kara—gṛha n. a pig-sty,
> saukarika = m. a boar hunter, pig-dealer, R. ; VarBṛS. ; Buddh.
>
>
> mārdava n. (ifc. f(ā). ) softness (lit. and fig.), pliancy, weakness,
> gentleness, kindness, leniency towards (with gen. e.g.
> mārdava-sarva-bhūtānām, leniency towards all beings),
>
> so in Skt, sūkara-mārdava would mean ‘tender pig-meat’ but also implies
> the leniency that Buddha extends to Cunda by reassuring him that the ill
> effects of the meal are not his fault.
>
> Another commentary story, however, has Buddha pass a different judgement
