Dear Palaniappan,


Sorry, this is a negative response, but with a reference you may not have yet. I find no reference to Suresh Pillai in the following article, which deals with that same subject:


Gillet, Valérie. 2014. “The Dark Period: Myth or Reality?” Indian Economic & Social History Review 51 (3): 283–302. https://doi.org/10.1177/0019464614536018.


Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

Subject: [INDOLOGY] An article on Kalabhras

Dear Indologists,

Someone mentioned to me that Suresh B. Pillai, the author of "Introduction to the Study of Temple Art" (1976), also authored an article on the Kalabhras. Does anybody know the reference? I would like a copy of the article, if available.

Thanks in advance

Regards,
Palaniappan
