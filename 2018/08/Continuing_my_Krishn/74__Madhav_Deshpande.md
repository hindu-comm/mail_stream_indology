मधुर: श्वशुरालय:

Sweet home of Father-in-Law


प्रीति: श्वशुरजामात्रोर्दुर्लभा जगतीतले ।

न जहीतो यया बद्धौ कदाचन परस्परम् ।।४८३।।

The love between a father-in-law and a son-in-law, bound with which they
will not leave each other, is rare in the world.


मया [मा > मया] सह हरि: शेते क्षीराब्धौ श्वशुरालये ।

उमयापि महादेवो हिमाद्रौ श्वशुरालये ।।४८४।।

[However], Vishnu resides with Lakshmi [= mā] on the ocean, the home of his
father-in-law. Shiva too resides with Uma on the Himalaya mountain, the
home of his father-in-law.


महार्णवं परित्यज्य न मा [ = लक्ष्मी:] क्वचन गच्छति ।

हिमालयं परित्यज्य नाप्युमा याति कुत्रचित् ।।४८५।।

Lakshmi [= mā] does not abandon the ocean and go somewhere else.  [Similarly],
Uma does not abandon the Himalaya and go somewhere else.
