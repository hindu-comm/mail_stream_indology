Happy to have completed 500 Krishna verses, and continuing:

सर्वासु दिक्षु पश्यामि पदचिह्नानि ते हरे ।
अभितोऽसीति जानामि न तु पश्यामि ते मुखम् ।।४९६।।
O Krishna, I see your footprints in all directions. I know that you are
near, and yet I do not see your face.

बालानां मृदुशब्देषु तव गोपाल शब्दनम् ।
यूनां युवतिभि: सार्धं नृत्ये ते नर्तनं हरे ।।४९७।।
In the soft words of children, O Krishna, there is your voice. In the dance
of the youth with young ladies is your own dance, O Krishna.

पक्षिणां वनवृन्देषु कूजितं मुरलीरव: ।
हरिणानामरण्येषु धावने तव खेलनम् ।।४९८।।
In the bowers in the woods, the tweeting of birds is the sound of your
flute. In the running of the deer in the forest is your own play.

मयूराणां च पिच्छेषु हरे ते शीर्षभूषणम् ।
मृगीणामपि नेत्रेषु तव बिम्बं जनार्दन ।।४९९।।
In the feathers of peacocks, O Krishna, is your head-ornament. O Lord,
there is a reflection of yours in the eyes of the she-deer.

नीलिमा गगनस्थोऽसौ वपुषस्ते निदर्शनम् ।
घनेषु कृष्णता कृष्ण सम्भवेत् त्वां विना कथम् ।।५००।।
The blue color of the sky is a sign of your body, and how could there be
darkness in the clouds without you?
