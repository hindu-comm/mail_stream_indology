Continuing my Krishna verses:

कदाचिन्निशि सुप्तोऽहमशब्दं सर्वतो जगत् ।
मम कर्णपथे यातं कृष्णस्य वचनं तदा ।।५१०।।
Once I was asleep at night and the world around me was silent. Then these
words of Krishna reached my ears.

कृष्णो मामब्रवीत् -
Krishna said to me.
[Partly inspired by James Dillet Freeman’s 1947 poem “I am there,” taken to
the moon by astronaut James B. Irwin on Apollo 15]

मा भैषीरहमेवास्मि तवाहं परम: सखा ।
इच्छामि ते कथयितुं किञ्चित् तच्छृणु मे सुहृद् ।।५११।।
Don’t be afraid. Its Me, your best friend. O friend, I want to tell you
something. Listen.

अहमस्मि समीपे ते साहाय्यं मे यदीच्छसि ।
अन्वेष्टुं मा गमोऽन्यत्र व्यथां ते कथयस्व मे ।।५१२।।
If you want my help, I am near you. Don’t go elsewhere to search for me.
Tell me what is bothering you.

प्रियोऽसि मे सुहृद् भक्त स्मर मां ते सहायकम् ।
त्वदर्थं सत्वरं मित्र नागच्छेयमहं कथम् ।।५१३।।
O friend, my devotee, your are dear to me. Remember me as your helper. O
friend, how shall I not come quickly for you?
