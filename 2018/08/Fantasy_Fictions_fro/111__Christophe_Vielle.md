Two Fantasy Fictions from the Bengal Renaissance, New Delhi: OUP, 2018: 

a book on the margins/intersections of folktale/folklore studies, kiddylit studies and colonial Indological cultural studies proper.  

Maybe there is a  Bengal/South Asia-involved folklorist who would be willing to review it for the Folklore Fellows, who say they will not send it out for review themselves, but will print a review if they receive one? (This seems to be an odd way of doing things, but that is what they said.)

Fantasy Fictions from the Bengal Renaissance
Abanindranath Tagore’s The Make-Believe Prince (Kheerer Putul) Gaganendranath Tagore’s Toddy-Cat the Bold (Bhondaṛ Bahadur). Translated by Sanjay Sircar.
Publication date: 29/06/2018
ISBN: 9780199486755 
Paperback 372 pages
Description


Fantasy Fictions from the Bengal Renaissance presents two masterpieces of Bengali literature by Rabindranath Tagore’s nephews, Abanindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath Tagore. 
The Make-Believe Prince is the delightful story of a king, his two wives, a trickster monkey, a witch, and a helper from another world who is not a ‘fairy godmother’. Abanindranath deploys traditional children’s rhymes and paints exquisite word-pictures in his original rendering of a tale which has its roots in Bengali folktale materials in various genres. 
Toddy-Cat the Bold sees a group of brave comrades seek help from a young boy to rescue the son of their leader from the Two-Faced Rakshasa of the forest. Here, a more numinous supernatural helper appears. Inspired by Lewis Carroll’s Alice books, it presents a comic, exciting, and mysterious journey quite unlike Carroll’s, with many traditional local touches and an unexpected ending. 

About the Author 
Abanindranath Tagore was a renowned Indian artist, author, and folklorist. 
Gaganendranath Tagore was a famous satirical cartoonist, and a pioneer of lithography and design in India. 
The two brothers are considered to be among the earliest modern artists of India. They founded the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Kolkata, India.
