Hello Harry,

     In a sandhi sequence like devān+tatra, according to P 8.3.7
(naśchavyapraśān), the word final n changes into ru, which changes into
visarga and ultimately into s.  The vowel before the n becomes optionally
nasalized by P 8.3.2 (atrānunāsikaḥ pūrvasya tu vā), and in the alternative
that it does not become nasalized, it is followed by an anusvāra by P.8.3.4
(anunāsikāt paro 'nusvāraḥ).  The rule P 8.3.36 (vā śari)  says that a
word-final visarga optionally remains a visarga before ś, ṣ, and s, while
the Vārttika (kharpare śari vā lopo vaktavyaḥ) stipulates that if the
following ś, ṣ and s are followed by a khaR sound (i.e. kh, ph, ch, ṭh, th,
c, ṭ, t, k, p, ś, ṣ, or s, then the visarga is optionally deleted.  Your
example अमुष्मिं स्तवे, and the observations of Whitney, MacDonell and
Coulson seem to relate to the variation noted by these rules of Pāṇini and
the Vārttika.  There are quite a few options involved, and they reflect the
variation in the usage.  Best,

Madhav
