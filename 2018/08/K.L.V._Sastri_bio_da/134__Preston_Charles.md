Hello List,
Iâ€™m looking or any biographical information on K.L.V. Sastri, the Sanskrit scholar and occasional author of modern literature. Just dates of birth and death would be very helpful, but any other details (e.g. place of birth) would be of interest. Have poured through as much of his material as I can find in libraries and have yet to find a detailed bio.  Maybe someone out there knew him?
Thanks in advance,
Charles
