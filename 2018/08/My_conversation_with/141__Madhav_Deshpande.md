Conversation between me and my Sanskritist sister Manik:

Manik to me:
कृष्णकाव्यानि रचयन् मत्कुणं भजते कथम् । "How can someone who writes poems
on Krishna also devotes to bed bugs?"

Me to Manik:
कवीनां च कपीनां च पदानां नास्ति बन्धनम् ।।
"The steps/words of monkeys and poets have no restrictions."
