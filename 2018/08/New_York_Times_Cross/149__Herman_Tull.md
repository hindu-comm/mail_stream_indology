The online edition of today's new York Times crossword puzzle (which I
presume to be the same as the print edition) has "Early Indus Valley
Inhabitant" as the clue for 12 down. Sorry to be a spoiler here, but the
answer turns out to be "Aryan"! While I am pleased to see the Indus Valley
reference, the answer is disappointing, to say the least.

cheers,

Herman Tull
