The/Brahmayāmala/or/Picumata/is one of the earliest surviving 
goddess-oriented (/śākta/)/tantra/s, its core probably dating back to 
the late seventh or early eighth century. Though long forgotten, it is 
thus crucial to understanding the early history of the 
Tantrictraditions.Spanning more than twelve-thousand verses 
and104chapters, this monumental work is transmitted in a beautiful 
Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript of theeleventh century, which forms the 
principal basis for this criticaledition. Complementing volume II, 
edited by Csaba Kiss in the same series, thisvolumeincludes the 
firstpublishededition and annotated translation of five chaptersof 
the/Brahmayāmala/. The volume alsopresents pioneering studies 
ontopicsthesechapters illuminate: Tantric Śaiva conceptions ofrevelation 
and the canon, the history of Tantric coital ritual,the mythology of 
Bhairava,and the iconographyand symbolism of the skull-staff 
(/khaṭvāṅga/). As with other texts published in the Early Tantra Series, 
study of the/Brahmayāmala/helps reshape our knowledge of Tantric Śaivism 
and religion in early medieval India.
