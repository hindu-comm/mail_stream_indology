Hi Birgit:

Off the top of my head, there is the wonderful article on “iva” by Joel Brereton, and I think on “khila” by Emeneau.

I am particularly interested in presentations of the range of options that are available from vyākaraṇa analysis, and discussions of the metalanguage used (e.g. avadhāraṇa, samuccaya, sambhāvanā, atiśaya ...).
