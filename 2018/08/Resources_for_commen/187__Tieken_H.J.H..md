How can I forget. I myself wrote an article on kira/kiri as well:  “Two Peculiar Usages of the Particle kira/kiri in Apabhraṃśa”. Sambodhi 32 (2009), 33-36.
In this article I refer to Van Daalen's article mentioned in my previous mail, published in IIJ XXX (1988), pp, 111-137 and to I. Ickler, Die vedische Partikel kila, published in Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachfirschung 90 (1976), pp. 50-86.

Onderwerp: Re: [INDOLOGY] Resources for commentarial interpretations of particles

The article by Emeneau, entitled "Sanskrit syntactic particles ---
khalu, khila and nuunam", appeared, if I recall correctly, in JOAS in 1969.

I don't recall where Joel's article appeared.

I am particularly interested in presentations of the range of options that are available from vyākaraṇa analysis, and discussions of the metalanguage used (e.g. avadhāraṇa, samuccaya, sambhāvanā, atiśaya ...).
