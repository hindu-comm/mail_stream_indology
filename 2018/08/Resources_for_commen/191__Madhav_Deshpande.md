As for traditional resources, there are sections like Nipātārthanirṇaya in
the works of Kauṇḍabhaṭṭa and Nāgeśabhaṭṭa, and the Naiyāyikas have
produced many works on the meaning of the negative particle like nañvāda
and on the meaning of *eva *like "evakāravicāra."  Discussions of Paryudāsa
and prasajyapratiṣedha are also useful.
