Dear Jan,

thanks for the positive feedback on the word splitter. Hope it turns out 
to be useful for our research community.

Reg. RV 1.1.1: The analysis does not imply that dhAtama is 
morphologically derived from dA "to give", although one may get this 
impression by the term "giving" in that line. "giving" is just a coarse 
word semantic annotation of dhAtama, which is - it's meant to be coarse! 
- not too far away from Jamison + Brereton 2014 ("most richly conferring 
treasure"). Same for the English terms (if any) in other lines.

Best wishes, Oliver
