Hi Madhav,

I think I'm still a little unclear.

I follow this for  devān+tatra,

I.e. if n is before  ch, ṭh, th, c, ṭ, or t   then n -> ru
devān+tatra ->  devāru+tatra ->   devāḥ+tatra  -> devās+tatra

The vowel before the n becomes optionally nasalized by P 8.3.2

I.e.  devās+tatra ->   devāṁs+tatra, or devās+tatra  with nasalized vowel


The rule P 8.3.36 (vā śari)  says that a word-final visarga optionally

I see how this applies to   devān+tatra but I'm unclear how we get from
amuṣmin+ stave to amuṣmiṁ+stave since in this case the n is followed by s
and I don't see how rule 8.3.7 applies.

Thanks,
