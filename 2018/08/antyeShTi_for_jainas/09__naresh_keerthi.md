 Dear Prof Jain,

For a description of the saṃskāras prescribed for śrāvakas who die of
natural causes, chapter 40 of Jinasena’s Ādipurāṇa has some material. His
description mostly reflects the practices delineated in the brahminical
Dharmaśāstra literature.

With regard to ritual death and the subsequent rites for śrāvakas as well
as śramaṇas, S.Settar’s two English books ‘Inviting Death’ and ‘Pursuing
Death’ (reissued by Primus Books in 2016) may offer helpful pointers. His rich
bibliography included Prakrit and Kannada texts – ritual and literary that
are less-known.


Regards,

Naresh Keerthi

 Dear Members

I would like to know what are the last rites (anteshthi) in Jainism
historically? How are they different from Hinduism.


Sincerely
Rajeev Jain
