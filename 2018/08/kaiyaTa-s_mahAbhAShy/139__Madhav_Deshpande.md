Abhyankar's dictionary of Sanskrit grammar on the word
*pratinirdiśyamāna *quotes
the following line from Kaiyaṭa's Mahābhāṣya-Pradīpa, without giving a
reference as to where this line occurs.  Is there a searchable text of
Pradīpa available online?  Otherwise, if anyone has come across this quote
from Kaiyaṭa, please let me know where it occurs.  Best,
