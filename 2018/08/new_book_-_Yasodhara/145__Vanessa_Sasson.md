Dear colleagues,

It is with great pleasure that I am sharing news of my new book, Yasodhara. This book has taken the shape of a novel - unlike previous publications - although it is based on many years of research. It is Yasodhara's story, in her voice, as best as I could imagine it.

The book is published by the wonderful team at Speaking Tiger in Delhi and is available in North America via amazon. Here is a link:

My apologies for the cross-posting.
With warm wishes,
