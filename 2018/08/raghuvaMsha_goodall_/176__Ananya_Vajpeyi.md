It appears there was or was to be an edition and translation of the
Raghuvaṃśa by Dominic Goodall and Harunaga Isaacson in the Clay Sanskrit
Library series. If anyone has it as a pdf would you mind terribly sending
it to me? I'm not entirely sure it was completed or published, but if it's
out there, I'd love to get access. (It may have a commentary by
Vallabhadeva).

Many thanks,

Ananya Vajpeyi.
