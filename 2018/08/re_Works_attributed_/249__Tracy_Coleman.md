Introduction. Śaṅkara (or Śaṃkara, c. 8th century CE) is widely recognized as the most influential teacher in the early development of the Hindu tradition of Advaita or nondualist Vedanta, as well as one of the most significant philosophers of South Asia.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Works attributed to Śaṅkarācārya

CAUTION: This email originated from outside Colorado College. As always, please be careful when opening links or attachments in any email.

Dear list members,

I'm looking for articles that discuss the authorship of works attributed to Śaṅkarācārya .  Which works are considered genuinely by him and which are not.

Even better are articles that discuss the authorship  and dating of the Dakṣiṇāmūrtistotram .  Whether that is considered genuinely by Śaṅkarācārya or whether that is a much later work.

Many thanks,
Harry Spier
