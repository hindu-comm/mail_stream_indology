Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Works attributed to Śaṅkarācārya

Dear Alakendu Das,
As you know, each of the maṭhas started by Śaṅkarācārya

 has a long line of adhipatis up to the present. Each adhipati also has the title 
Śaṅkarācārya. So there have been many Śaṅkarācāryas

 after 


















Ādi Śaṅkarācārya. The idea, then, is that the majority of the more than 400 works attributed to Śaṅkarācārya

 are actually by laterŚaṅkarācāryas, not by Ādi Śaṅkarācārya, even though they are usually taken to be by 
Ādi Śaṅkarācārya.
A clear example of this is the Saundarya-laharī, which has long been attributed toŚaṅkarācārya, meaning 
Ādi Śaṅkarācārya. V. Raghavan found a manuscript of this work whose colophon stated that it is byŚaṅkarācārya, the adhipati of the Sarasvatī-pīṭha at 
Śrīvidyānagara, i.e., a later 
Śaṅkarācārya. (See footnote 24 in The Saundaryalaharī

 or Flood of Beauty, edited and translated by W. Norman Brown, Harvard University Press, 1958, pp. 29-30.)

There are also known cases where a work written by someone else has somehow, over the years, gotten attributed toŚaṅkarācārya. An example of this is the Prabodha-sudhākara. V. Raghavan showed of the basis of manuscript colophons, etc., that it was actually written by Daivajña Sūrya Paṇḍita. (See his article, "The Nṛsimha Campū of Daivajña Sūrya Paṇḍita and the Nṛsimhavijñāpana of 
Śrī

 Nṛsimhāśramin," Adyar Library Bulletin, vol. 1, 1937, p. 44.)
Best regards,

Mr.Reigle,
It was enriching going through your elaboration on Shankara's work.However,I find it interesting to know ,if 24 out of 408 works are actually by Shankara himself,then who composed the rest?
