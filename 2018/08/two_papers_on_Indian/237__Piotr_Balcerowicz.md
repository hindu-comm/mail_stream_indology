Dear Colleagues,

I would like to share an open link (
http://www.balcerowicz.eu/indology/schayer2001.pdf) to two papers of *Stanisław
Schayer: "Studies on Indian Logic" and "On the Method of the Nyāya
Research"*, first published in 1932–1933. These are English translations
from their German originals, which are slightly enlarged and remodelled
versions of Schayer’s two earlier communiqués in Polish. The English
translations contain occasional addenda taken from Polish originals which
were absent in Schayer’s own German translations. Both papers were
translated by Piotr Balcerowicz in 2000 and appeared in the *Materials of
The International Seminar: Argument And Reason In Indian Logic, 20–24 June
2001*.

Best regards,

Piotr Balcerowicz
