Dear Listmembers,

explaining a very detailed Vessantara-mural in Srilanka I can not find 
the textual source for the picture attached to this email. The context 
of the story is like this:
Sanda, Vessantara's father looks for a proper wife for his son. He sends 
a messenger to king Madda asking for the daugther Phusat朝. Here follows 
a painting that depicts Phusat朝 discussing with her mother? (see the 
attached pic). After this, the mural follows again the source and 
depicts Phusat朝 being brought to Sanda's palace.

Anyone came across a source that describes a talk between Phusat朝 and 
another lady? I checked Pali, Sinhalese, MSV-Sanskrit and (with 
assistance) Tibetan sources. Without success. May be I missed something?

Best

Heiner
