Dear Colleague*s*,



I have two questions about a passage from the *Nāṭyaśāstra *cited in V.
Raghava’s book,* The Number of Rasas.* The passage comes at the ed of
Ragavan’s summary of the “adbhuta synthesis” of Nārāyaṇa, the grandfather
of Viśvanātha.

First I give it in what seems a paraphrase: “The story has to be, says
Bharata, like a cow’s tail, bushy at the end, full of surprises. There must
be adbhuta at the end.”

Raghavan 1940, 173 cites and quotes *Nāṭyaśāstra* 20.46-47, which I give
here in my transliteration:

kAryaM gopucchAgraM kartavyaM kAvyabandhamAsAdya

ye codAttA bhAvAH te sarve pRSThataH kAryAH

sarveSAM kAvyAnaM nAnArasabhAvayuktiyuktAnAm

nirvahaNe kartavyo nityaM hi raso ‘dbhutastajjJaiH



My two questions are:

1.      I don’t see in the Sanskrit what would make the cow’s tail “bushy?”

2.      Can any of you tell me whether this is one of the *Nāṭyaśāstra*’s
well-known gems, and, whether it is or not, does gopuccha occur elsewhere
in connection with literary endings?



Very best,

Alf Hiltebeitel
