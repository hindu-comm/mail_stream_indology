Continuing my Krishna verses
Krishna says to me:

अजानन् मां ममास्तित्वं नास्तीति यदि मन्यसे ।
कस्ते मतिं चोदयति क्षणं तत् त्वं विचिन्तय ।।५२२।।
Not knowing me, if you think that I don’t exist, think for a moment as to
you impels your thoughts.

यदा त्वं मां चिन्तयसि तदाहं सन्निधौ तव ।
यदा न मां चिन्तयसि तदाहं सन्निधौ तव ।।५२३।।
When you think of me, I am near you. But even if you do not think of me, I
am still near you.

मयि त्वं सर्वदा मित्र त्वय्यहं चास्मि सर्वदा ।
मनस्ते तमसाक्रान्तमभेदं द्रष्टुमक्षमम् ।।५२४।।
O friend, you are always in Me and I am always in you. However, your mind,
overwhelmed by ignorance, is unable to see the non-difference.

मनोगतं तम: सर्वं यदा नश्यति विद्यया ।
तदा ते हृदयाकाशे मामेवेक्षिष्यसे सदा ।।५२५।।
With wisdom, when all the darkness in your mind will disappear, then in the
space of your heart, you will always see only Me.
