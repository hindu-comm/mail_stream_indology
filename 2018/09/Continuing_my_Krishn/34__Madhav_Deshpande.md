Continuing my Krishna Verses:


भक्तोऽसि मे प्रियस्त्वं मे सखाहं प्रियकृत्तम: ।

मनो मे त्वयि संलग्नं त्वदीयं च मयि प्रिय ।।५३०।।

You are my devotee and are dear to Me.  I am your friend, doing what is
most dear to you.  My mind is attached to you, and your mind is attached to
Me.


मम प्रेम्णाभिषिञ्चामि सखेऽहं त्वामहर्निशम् ।

का ते चिन्ता यदा भारस्तव सर्वो मयि स्थित: ।।५३१।।

O friend, day and night I shower you with my love.  When all your burden
rests on me, what is your worry?”


इमां वाचं मनसि मे कृष्णेन समुदीरिताम् ।

स्मरन्नहर्निशं शान्तिं लभेऽहं मे कुतो भयम् ।।५३२।।

Day and night, remembering these words spoken by Krishna in my mind, I
attain peace.  What do I have to be afraid of?
