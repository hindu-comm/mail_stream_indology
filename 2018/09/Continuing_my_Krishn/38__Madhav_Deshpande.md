Continuing my Krishna verses:

जानामि त्वं समीपेऽसि सन्नद्धस्त्वं ममावने ।
गता मे मनसो भीतिर्लब्धा शान्तिर्जनार्दन ।।५३९।।
I know that you are near me and ready to protect me. O Lord, the fear is
gone from my mind, and I have found peace.

गच्छ त्वं यत्र कुत्रापि जगतस्तापशान्तये ।
सर्वत्र वर्तमानस्त्वं दूरं यास्यसि रे कथम् ।।५४०।।
You can go wherever you want to rid the world of its torments. But being
everywhere, how will you go away?
