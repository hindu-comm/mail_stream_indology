 Dear Emmanuel,
For the Persian/Arabic expression, is not to say for certain without seeing the Persian seal.
It is not certainly a single word but it seems a compound expression. If is meant to be a translation of dharma it could be "rāh ilā Allāh" i.e. the "way to Allah". This does not seem to me a conventional expression, especially the combination of the Persian rāh with the Arabicilā Allāh,but it could be an acceptable translation for dharma.
All the best,
Fabrizio

 Dear Colleagues,

I am presently studying a set of spurious Chola copper plates (in Tamil and Telugu) in the Chennai Government Museum from available descriptions and translations (no illustrations, unfortunately).
Sources mention that the plates bear a Persian seal.
In the catalogue of copper-plates of the Museum Srinivasa Ayyangar (1918, p. 15) writes:

“This and the subjoined eleven grants are more or less similar in character. Two of them are exactly alike, while the rest differ in minor details. These bear a seal at the top of the plates, in which is inscribed, in Persian, ‘Rāhēlilla’ which means dharma or charity and another seal at the end of the inscription, in which is inscribed, in Telugu, ‘yekkōl Appājī’.”

Could anybody kindly enlighten me on ‘Rāhēlilla’? Is it Persian? Arabic? Both? What does it mean precisely? Are other examples known?

A subsidiary question concerns ‘yekkōl Appājī’? What does it mean? Note that Burgess & Naṭēśa Śāstrī (1886, pp. 137ff.), who edited and translated some of these plates, record variant readings of “Yekkōl Appājī” on some of the plates: 
“Yekōl Appājī”, “Ekkōlu Appājī”. 
There is also a Telugu seal reading “Yajva Appājī”.
