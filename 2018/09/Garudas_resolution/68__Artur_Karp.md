Dear Prof. Hock,

Thanks for the detailed analysis of the sentence.

But. 'Anyone'.

My English-Polish/Polish-English Dictionary directs me from 'anyone' to
'anybody'. And - according to it - 'anybody' may also mean 'somebody
unimportant'. In Polish: 'byle kto'.

Would you - definitely - exclude this very meaning? After careful
deliberations, I decided for using it in my Polish translation of the
episode.

Best,

Artur Karp (MA)
Senior Lecturer in Sanskrit and Pali (ret.)
Department of South Asian Studies
University of Warsaw
