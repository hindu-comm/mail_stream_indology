The snakes (to whom Garuḍa is ready to bring the stolen Soma).
See the story as told in the late Vedic metrical play Suparṇādhyāya, sūkta 14, varga 28, v. 10,
ed. and transl. Gaya Charan Tripathi (New Delhi: Nat.Mis.Mss and DKPrintworld, 2016), pp. 252 (critically restored text), 295 (transl.)
induṃ cet sarpāḥ pāsyanti tvayā dattaṃ vihaṅgama |
ajanaṃ te kariṣyanti tan na sādhu bhaviṣyati ||10||
[Indra to Garuḍa]
“In case the snakes [are allowed to] drink the Soma (= amṛtam) [bought by you and] given to them, [[o Bird]], they will make a clean sweep of all human beings [on earth]. This [surely] wouldn't be nice.”
And in sūkta 15, varga 29, v. 6, Indra turning to Garuḍa (who has visited the serpents, but has not given them the Sma):
“I have excelled all my ennemies in might. Because of my might I am all in this (i.e. overlord of this) world. How did you [dare to] take away by force the Soma which is pressed [especially] for such a mightier than mighty [person] like me.”
So one can infer that the soma provides this almightiness.
