Dear Colleagues,

The IASS is happy to announce the Honorary Research Fellowship
Beginning 1st March 2019 (with apologies for multiple postings).

Any paying member of the IASS (International Association of Sanskrit  
Studies) is eligible for the HRF, if the scholar has received a PhD in  
Sanskrit or allied studies in the last five years beginning March 2015.

The HRF is for research work to be conducted in South Asia for a  
period of at least two weeks in any field related to Sanskrit and  
allied studies.

The DEADLINE for the written project proposal is 31 DECEMBER 2018.

The honorary research fellowship, valued at 1000 Euros, will be  
announced annually, providing the IASS budget is able to sustain the  
expense.
