In M.P. Pandit's "Bases of Tantra Sadhana" (page 32-33), he cites a text,
the "Brihani," which I am unfamiliar with and haven't been able to find a
single reference to anywhere else. Hoping someone in the list might be able
to shed some light on it. Many thanks.

His quote is as follows:

"Truth has no gender, but it is spoken of in terms of gender." -Brihani

attached is a photo of the page
