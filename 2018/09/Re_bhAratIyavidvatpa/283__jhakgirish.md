Dear Professor Sahab,It's really a new idea and style to present thedevotion/Bhakti to Shri Krishna.I am indeed delighted.But you don't remember the Divine Couple including Rajarajeshwari Alabeli Aparimitakarunaamayi Sachchidaanandarupaa Radha ShriKrishnasya paanigrihiti api vane Brahmavaivartaanusaarena.Although SriKrisna is Akaaranakarunaavarunaalayah but in doing karunaa Raadhaa goes superior to Shri Krishna as She never examines her Bhaktas especially sharanaagatas.Tathaapi kinchin nahi vaktum ishe harshaabdhi vichi muditaantaraatmaa./Iti ShriKrisnadaasaanudaasasya GirishJha sharmanah.

Continuing my Krishna verses:
Krishna says to me:
नाहं कश्चिच्चित्ररूपो न परोक्षो न वाद्भुत: ।समाहिते तु ते चित्ते मां पश्येस्त्वं यथास्थितम् ।।५१८।।I am not some strange form, remote or mysterious.  With a calm mind, you will see me as I am.
हृदि संवेदना तेऽहं, श्रद्धा तेऽहं, मतिस्तथा ।चिन्ता तेऽहं, गतिस्तेऽहं, गम्योऽहं न कथं तव ।।५१९।।I am the sensation in your heart, your faith and your intelligence.  I am your thought and your movement.  How am I not known to you?
आपद्गतो यदा मित्र मामाह्वयसि ते गिरा ।न दूरेऽहं समीपस्थस्तवाहमवने रत: ।।५२०।।Fallen in some difficulty, O friend, when you call me with your words, I am not far away.  I am near you and busy protecting you.
तव दु:खानि जानामि सुखानि च सुहृत् सदा ।व्यतीत्य मां भूतलेऽस्मिन् न दु:खं न च वा सुखम् ।।५२१।।O friend, I know your sorrows and happiness.  In this world, no sorry or happiness transcends me.
