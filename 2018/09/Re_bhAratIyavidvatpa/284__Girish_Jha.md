Dear Professor Deshpande,
I had expressed my humble suggestion about Radha ji.It's a matter of
spiritual bliss and nothing else.As far as I know Radha is worshipped with
Krisna everywhere.Your poetry is not a general one but it should be
considered a devotional poetry.Hence my advice is not aimed at any narrow
thinking but  is to deepen   the love emotion.A few years back Prof.Rasik
vihari Joshi has also written a lot on Radha-Krisna Bhakti.Bhakti poetry
has to be preserved within the bounds of Indian Culture.Nothing more to
write.All are here Sanskrit Scholars.Jaya Radhe Shyama.Pranamaami punah
punah.
