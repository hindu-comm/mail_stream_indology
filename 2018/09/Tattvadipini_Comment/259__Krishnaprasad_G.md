Dear list members

I am looking forward some favor to search the Tattvadipini Manuscript which
is written by Jagaddhara on the original work Vasavadatta.

NCC suggests America 2085 and I also happen to see it expansion in the
initial pages. But I am not clear as to which institute to be contacted. Is
that
American oriental Society Connectict ??
Could anyone kindly help.

PS
Tattvadipini editing is my thesis Subject


Thanks
Krishna Prasad
