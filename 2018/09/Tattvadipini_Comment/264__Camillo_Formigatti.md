Dear Krishna Prasad,

I don’t know if you are aware of it, but the Bodleian Libraries also hold a manuscript of this work, it is MS Chandra Shum Shere d.404(2) (70 ff. in Devanagari).

If you need to order reproductions, please contact me.

Best wishes,

Camillo

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Tattvadipini Commentary MSS America 2085

Dear list members

I am looking forward some favor to search the Tattvadipini Manuscript which is written by Jagaddhara on the original work Vasavadatta.

NCC suggests America 2085 and I also happen to see it expansion in the initial pages. But I am not clear as to which institute to be contacted. Is that
American oriental Society Connectict ??
Could anyone kindly help.

PS
Tattvadipini editing is my thesis Subject


Thanks
Krishna Prasad
