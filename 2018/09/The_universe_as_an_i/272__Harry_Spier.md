The first verse of the Dakṣināmūrtistotram is:

viśvaṁ darpaṇa-dṛśyamāna-nagarī-tulyaṁ nijāntar-gataṁ

paśyann-ātmani māyayā bahir ivodbhutaṁ yathā nidrayā

yaḥ sākṣāt kurute prabodha-samaye svātmanam evādvayaṁ

tasmai śri-guru-mūrtaye nama idaṁ śri-dakṣināmūrtaye


One of the reasons Amarhath Rai in his article "The Daksinamurti Hymn and
the Manasollasa published in Vol. 6 of The Journal of Oriental Research,
Madras, 1932 gives for rejecting Sankaracarya as the author is  the
metaphor in the first verse of the world as an image in a mirror.

Does  this metaphor of the world as an image in a mirror only appear in
Kashmir Shaivite writings or does it occur in  the writings of other
religous or philosophical schools.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
