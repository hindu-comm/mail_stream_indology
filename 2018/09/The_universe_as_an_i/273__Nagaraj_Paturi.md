अथ एव चोपमासूर्यकादिवत् 3.2.28 ब्रह्मसूत्र

itself has the image/simile of images.

सूर्यक here means the Sun's image.

3.2.28 is part of explaining

न स्थानतोपि परस्योभयलिङ्गपरस्योभयलिङ्गं सर्वत्र हि 3.2.11

Thus 'image' as the relation between Brahman and the (entities in) Jagat is
not limited to Advaita Vedanta. It is common to all schools of Vedanta.

What Dakshinamurti stotra is specifically doing is making Jagat the image
of  Aatman inside the observer's ownself (निजांतर्गातं). For Advaita Aatman
= Brahman.
