RV 7.59.12 त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धि पुष्टिवर्धनम्। उर्वारुकमिव
बन्धनान्मृत्योर्मुक्षीय माऽमृतात्। does not have a Padapāṭha.  This is not
a repeated mantra in the RV Saṃhitā.  What might be the reason why this
mantra does not have a Padapāṭha?  Is it likely that there were a few
post-Padapāṭha additions to the RV Saṃhitā?  Someone asked this question on
another discussion group.
