Hi there

Could anyone point me to use of the term *dahyamƒÅna vastu* in the Vedic
literature?  It shows up in tantric material discussing the use of mantras
in the internal fire of the yogi (with some Vedic ritual comparisons) and
it's not perfectly clear to me whether the term is intended to refer to the
mantras or the fire itself.

Cheers
James
