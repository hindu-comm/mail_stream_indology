Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] goṣṭhī

My mail inadvertently was sent before I could finish my communication. I apologize. Here is the rest of my message.


The term "goṣṭhī" appears frequently in the ṡāstras of nāṭya and denotes a group dance with music and some acting. Here are some references:

 "Goṣṭhī' appears as a form of deśīnāṭya in Dattila, quoted in Saṅgītanārāyaṇa (3. 15-18); Vātsyāyana, in his Kāmasūtra mentions "goṣṭhī" along with hallisaka and nāṭyarāsaka and prekṣaṇaka as minor dramas or dance dramas (II.10.25);  Agnipurāṇa also mentions "goṣṭhī" without any detail. Bhoja first identified it as a minor drama in which Kṛṣṇa dances with gopis (Śṛṅgāraprakāśa, vol II, p. 468 in V. Raghavan, Madras,1963). Rāmacandra and Guṇacandra, Hemacandra, Vāgbhaṭa, Sāgaranandin, Sāradātanaya, Viśvanātha and Śubhaṅkara all include goṣṭhī in their list of minor dramatic types that require song and dance. Viśvanātha of the14th century identified minor dramatic types that included music and dance as uparūpakas. (See Bose, Mandakranta. Movement and Mimesis. Dordrecht, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991 for further details. p. 181).
I am sorry that my email is working erratically. I hope this time it reaches in correct form.

I should appreciate it if someone could direct me to any papers written on the Sanskrit word goṣṭhī or “the gentlemen’s club” in ancient India.
Many thanks in advance.
Best,
Ken
