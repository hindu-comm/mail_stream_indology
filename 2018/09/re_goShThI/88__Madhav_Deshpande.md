Hello Ken,

     It seems to me that the connection of the words goṣṭha and goṣṭhī
needs to be investigated.  Goṣṭha refers to the cowshed, and that cowshed
may have served as a place for gathering of friends and family members to
chat. Such may be the origin of goṣṭhī as a
dialogue/conversation/chatting.  In this sense, the word goṣṭī appears in
Marathi usage, and the vernacular usage is probably related to the use of
goṣṭhī in combinations like kāvyagoṣṭhī, vidvadgoṣṭhī etc.
