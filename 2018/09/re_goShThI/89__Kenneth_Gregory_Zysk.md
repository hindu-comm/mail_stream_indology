I should like to thank everyone who responded to my enquiry about goṣṭhī both on and off list. The suggestions were most help.
All the best,
Ken

I should appreciate it if someone could direct me to any papers written on the Sanskrit word goṣṭhī or “the gentlemen’s club” in ancient India.
Many thanks in advance.
Best,
Ken
