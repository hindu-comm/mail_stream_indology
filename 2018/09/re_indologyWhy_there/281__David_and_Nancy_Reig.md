The other two recensions of the Ṛgveda saṃhitā that are now available in
print have bearing on this question, the Āśvalāyana śākhā and the Śāṃkhāyana
śākhā. Both of them give a padapāṭha for verse 7.59.12. What we do not know
is whether the padapāṭha for this verse was actually found in the 16
manuscripts of the Āśvalāyana padapāṭha used by B. B. Chaubey for his
edition, or in the 17 manuscripts of the Śāṃkhāyana padapāṭha used by Amal
Dhari Singh Gautam for his edition.

B. B. Chaubey says (p. 57) that he himself supplied the padapāṭha for the
212 verses of the Āśvalāyana śākhā that are not found in the Śākala śākhā,
since the Āśvalāyana padapāṭha manuscripts did not give them. He does not
say whether he also supplied the padapāṭha for verse 7.59.12 that is found
in the Śākala śākhā but there lacks a padapāṭha. As far as I could see,
Amal Dhari Singh Gautam does not say whether he himself supplied the
padapāṭha for any verses in his edition of the Śāṃkhāyana śākhā. We may
recall that Vishva Bandhu's edition of the Ṛgveda quietly supplies the
padapāṭha for the six verses of the Śākala śākhā that did not have it.
