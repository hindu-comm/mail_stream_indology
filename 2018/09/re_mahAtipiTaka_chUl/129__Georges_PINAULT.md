Dear Colleagues,  For these issues and connected matter, the Handbook of Pâli Literature by Oskar von Hinüber (Berlin-New York, 1996) remains worthy of being consulted, see precisely p. 83 and 86. Best regards,  Georges-Jean Pinault

Since the Table is introduced with an explanation discussing that many texts have multiple names, so that all the texts in the same box are to be considered alternate names of the same basic texts (variants between mss. and editions, etc. included), it would seem theMilindapañhaṭīkā included as one of the titles, would be the same as the Milinda-ṭīkā ed. by Jaini. Tracking down the various editions, mss., etc. could be done by checking the catalogues cited.

The online bookAn Analysis of the Pāli Canon (http://budsas.net/sach/en137.pdf)seems to be a composite of two works. The first part by Webb is an “analysis” of the Pāli canon; the second part, with the table of texts and the catalogues in which they are identified, was initially a different work by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita titled A Reference Table of Pali Literature, which the online edition has added to the Webb book, treating them as a joint work; which is why the pagination for the later part with the Table commences new pagination.

Rahula’s article should indicate which edition of the ṭīkā he consulted, and that then could be examined to see whether that coincides with the Jaini edition (which at first was a separate volume, but PTS eventually included it in their reprint of Pali edition of Milindapañha), or is an alternate version of the same (or different) text.

best,
Dan

Hello Dan,

Do you know if the Milindapañhaṭīkā listed here as:


Madhuratthapakāsinī, Milindapañhaṭīkā, Milindapañhavivaraṇa (CM ?,
Mahātipiṭaka Cūḷābhaya or Cullavimalabuddhi, 1474)

is the same as the Milindaṭīkā published by Padmanabha Jaini, and published by the PTS?

Here’s a bit more, Madhav.


According to An Analysis of the Pāli Canon, Edited by Russell Webb(Kandy: Sri Lanka, Buddhist Publication Society, 2008 online ed.)
http://budsas.net/sach/en137.pdf

The -ṭīkā has several names, and the author is identified with two different names, one of them beingMahātipiṭaka Cūḷābhaya, so this is probably what Rahula was referring to. Pp. 21-22 of the “Table of Pāli Literature,” which begins about 3/4 of the way through the book lists the following.

2.6 Mil
Milindapañhā, Milindapaṇhā (Title is plural: see Mil 419: ... milindapañhā
samattā ... tisatapañhā honti, sabbāva milindapañhā ti saṅkhaṃ gacchanti.)
H 172ff, PL 110ff, PCS. 2.176, HP
93f, BnF 359f, LCM 1154, SH 237,

2.6.1 Mil-ṭ
Madhuratthapakāsinī, Milindapañhaṭīkā, Milindapañhavivaraṇa (CM ?,
Mahātipiṭaka Cūḷābhaya or Cullavimalabuddhi, 1474)

H 172m, PL 150, PSA 100f, HP 75,
PCS 2.151, SH 237, VP 4/126, CB
49, EP 58, CS.

Not to be conflated with

Milindapañhaaṭṭhakathā (B, Thatõn Mingun Zetawun Sayāḍo/Ū Nārada
Jetavana, 1949.)

The abbreviations refer to:

H: A Handbook of Pāli Literature. Oskar von Hinüber; Berlin 1996. (§)

I should add, that like with a previous query, this is another case of an earlier and later figure sharing the same name (the later MAHĀ-Tipiṭaka-Cūḷābhaya is 12th c., while the earlier one described by Malalasekera is considered pre-Buddhaghosa). I don’t believe that Jaini, who edited the Milinda-ṭīkā, identified the author of that commentary, but, since it cites Buddhaghosa, it must be by someone post-Buddhaghosa. Cf.http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-AN/an343601.pdf

Barua is quoting Walpola Rahula re: the 12th c Theravādin commentator who wanted to become a Buddha, with the reference: Walpola, R. 1971. L'ideal du Bodhisatta dans le Theravāda et le Mahāyāna. Journal Asiatique: 69.

I don’t have access to that Journal at the moment, so can’t check to see what sources Rahula was drawing on. Perhaps someone else has it on hand.

G.P. Malalasekera’s Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names offers the following.

http://www.softerviews.org/AIM/DPPN/culabhaya.html


3. Cūḷābhaya.–A Thera of Sri Lanka and a well-known commentator; he was known as Tipiṭaka-Cūḷābhaya. He is several times quoted in the Commentaries (e.g.,VibhA.11, 16; Vism.69, 394, 397). He had a prodigious memory. Once he shut three of the gates ofAnurādhapura, allowing only one door for the use of those leaving the city. As each person went out he asked his name, and each of these names he was able to repeat when the owner returned in the evening to the city (DA.ii.530). He was a contemporary ofCūḷanāga(DhsA.230; SA.iii.206), with whom he held discussions. His description (given at theLohapāsāda) (DA.ii.442) of the details connected with the first words uttered by the Buddha after his birth, and the manner in which he walked, is accepted as authentic. He once went with a company of monks on a pilgrimage toNāgadīpa. On the way he stayed in a monastery. One of his followers, who lacked self-control, made friends with another of like temperament in thevihāra, and Cūḷābhaya, seeing them laugh aloud, pointed out how truly the Buddha had said in the Dhātusaṃyutta that like joins with like. VibhA.457 f.

In an article by Ankur Barua [http://introductiontoappliedbuddhism.blogspot.com/2009/10/bodhisatta-concept-in-theravada.html], I came across this reference: "Theravādin author who wished to become a Buddhaby following the Bodhisatta-yāna is the `Sri Lankan
monk Mahā-Tipitaka Cūlābhaya. In his subcommentary on the “Questions of King Milinda” during the twelfth-century, he wrote that he wished to become a Buddha at the end of his work." Is this commentary the same as the Milindaṭīkā published by the PTS, or a different commentary? The Milinda-Aṭṭhakathā of U Nārada alias Mingun Zetavun Sayadaw that was written around 1948 and transcribed and published by me [Studia Philologica Buddhica, Monograph Series XIII, Tokyo, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, 1999] refers to the opinion of a Tipiṭaka-Cūl̥ābhayatthera on p.57. I would appreciate any information on this monk and his commentary on Milindapañha. Is it available anywhere? Best,
