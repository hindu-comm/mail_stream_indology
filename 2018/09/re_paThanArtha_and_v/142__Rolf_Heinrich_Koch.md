If we speak of vācanā PWB has s.v. vācana 2) f. ā: "Lektion, Kapitel" 
=Hemacandra's Pariśiṣṭaparvan 9.67sq:

One part of the Jaina canon (the Dṛṣṭivāda) was lost. The sangha came 
together in Pataliputra and sent monks to Bhadrabāhu in Nepal asking him 
to come to Pataliputra and teach the Dṛṣṭivāda. Bhadrabāhu was engaged 
in a religious vow and refused to join the meeting of monks. He offered 
to teach daily seven lessons to monks there in Nepal: ... /sapta 
dāsyāmi vācanāḥ/ (9.67d).
One lesson after returning from th begging tour (/tatraika vācanāṃ dāsye 
bhikṣācaryāta āgataḥ/ (9.68ab).
etc

In the Buddhist Cullavagga (GRETIL text) we read the colophon to a 
certain chapter of the Cullavagga:
.../mahāvihāravāsīnaṃ vācanā/ "[this is] the chapter (/vācanā/) from 
the residents of the Mahavihara...".
