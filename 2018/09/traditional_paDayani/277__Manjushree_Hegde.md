Dear list,

We are delighted to inform you that Amrita Darshanam — International Centre
for Spiritual Studies, in association with *Nārivāda*, Indira Gandhi
National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), is organizing a three-day national
seminar on “*Śakti Worship in India*” from September 21 to 23, 2018 at
Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, Kerala.

More than 25 scholars of renown will deliver invited lectures on the
different aspects of *śakti* worship in India. During the course of the
seminar, *two traditional rituals will be performed*: *Paḍayani and
Kalamezhuthu
Pattu. *

*Paḍayani* is a masked performance of an ancient ritual performed to
appease the fierce Bhadrakāli after she kills Dāruka. According to the
legend, it was first performed by Śiva’s *bhūtagaṇa*-s in order to pacify
her anger which could, otherwise, destroy the worlds. It is unique to
central Kerala — particularly popular in the districts of Kottayam and
Pathanamthitta.

It will be elaborately performed in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, on *21
September 2018* by traditional artists (Making of *kollams* (masks) will be
done throughout the day. Performance starts late evening, and will continue
into the wee hours of the morning)

*Kalamezhuthu* is a temple ritual that has three stages — (a) drawing of
the *kalam*, (b) worshiping of the *kalam* with lights called *thiri
uzhichil*, and (c) erasing of the *kalam* *maykkal*.

It will performed in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kerala, on *23 September
2018* (Drawing of *kalam* will start on the evening of 22/9/18; the ritual
will commence on the morning of 23/9/18, and will be completed in 12 hours)

Kindly refer to the brochure attached.
