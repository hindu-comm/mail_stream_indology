there is a mention of Steven Lindquist's "lines of descent and dissent"
published in "religions of south asia" 5. it is available in equinox
website for a price.  Brian Black's "Rethinking the Upanishadic Vamshas" is
also published in the same thing. I would be glad to read both. I hope you
will help me.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा
पापमवाप्स्यसि।।
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व
विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
