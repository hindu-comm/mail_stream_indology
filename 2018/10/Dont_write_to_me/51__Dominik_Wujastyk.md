Dear friends,

If you have any message relating to INDOLOGY - website or discussion forum
- please kindly write to the Managing Committee, <
indology-owner at list.indology.info>.  This contact address is given in the
footer on every page of the INDOLOGY <http://indology.info> website.

Please don't write to me personally.  The members of the committee take
turns to be on duty, and therefore we are all off duty more than we are on
duty.  If you write to me personally, I usually simply have the added work
of forwarding your message to the Committee address for you.

I'd be really grateful if you could follow these guidelines.

Best wishes,
Dominik Wujastyk (off duty Committee member :-)
