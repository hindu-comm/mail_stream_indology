Wielce Szanowny Panie Arnoldzie (Arnaudzie does not sound properly Polish),

Należę - zgodnie z Pańskim określeniem - do 'liściarzy' , czy 'listowników'
(listees) i dlatego pozwalam sobie na uwagę w języku, w którym ma sens
stare powiedzenie:

<<robić z igły widły>>

As far as I am concerned this exchange of arguments re ad Hitlerum and
contra-ad Hitlerum is more than a bit dull. Quite boring, frankly speaking.
Threatening to become endless - and, finally, empty.

Robi Pan z igły widły.

There are much more important topics that need be laid on the indological
discussion table - such as the introduction of iron forging technologies
and its consequences in the sphere of cultural politics. Or - such as the
origins of untouchability.

Regards from suddenly coldish Warsaw -

> As a trueborn Frenchman, I tend to focus more on contents than on formalistic issues.
> Among other things, that's why in rugby I believe that a SOB's kick in the testicles should be disapproved of, even if it's done Englishways à la gentleman.
> Of course, the Rugby International board thinks otherwise. If it looks à la gentleman, then it's ok.
> SOB's tricks are ok, if they respect surface "Etiquette". Well, I definitely disagree.
> Contents matters more than form, in my world.

> PT3. basically your "Etiquette", whatever that twisted pseudo-French word means, rejects my straightforward description but accepts Reductio ad Nazismus.
> So let me reword what Koenrad Elst's "work" is about:
> Basically, it's a Troyan horse: it looks like a pseudo-historiographical discourse, but the core of the beast is to sprinkle s*t and m*k on Indo-European Studies.
>
> So, concretely, your "Etiquette", whatever that twisted pseudo-French word means,
> 1. does not promotes (academic) courtesy, it promotes hypocrisy and oblique abusive perversion,
> 2. puts historiography at risk of becoming the playground for hypocritical "s*t and m*k sprinkling systems".
>
> I definitely believe that the historiography of sciences, and of linguistics in particular, deserves more than becoming the playground where a number of bastards can freely have fun with their "s*t and m*k sprinkling systems".
>
> As a matter of fact, in France, we have one indigenous exemplar of a "s*t and m*k sprinkling system", namely Jean-François Demoule, an archeologist who writes books on linguistics where he drools at heavy length on how much linguists are half-incompetent, half-nazi, etc.
