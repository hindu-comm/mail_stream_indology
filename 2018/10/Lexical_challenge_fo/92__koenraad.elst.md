Dear listfolk,
The last two e-mails I received on this forum either answer points I never made, or make points I already answered to in my previous mails. Since the art of reading properly what an author has actually said is quite well-developed in the present circle, I need not go over these points again.
Thanks also for the more constructive feedback I received off-line.
Kind regards,

Dr. Koenraad ELST
