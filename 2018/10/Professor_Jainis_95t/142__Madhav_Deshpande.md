I was so fortunate to attend Professor Padmanabh Jaini's 95th birthday
celebration yesterday at the University of California in Berkeley. In 1972,
Jaini left Michigan for Berkeley, and I became his replacement in Michigan.
He is a giant in the fields of Buddhist and Jain Studies, and it was
wonderful to see the love of his students and colleagues for him.
