Thanks for this, Madhav.
I was fortunate to be a student at Berkeley when Jaini arrived in 72 and have always continued to learn from his extraordinary scholarship. A revered guru!

Best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Professor Jaini's 95th birthday

I was so fortunate to attend Professor Padmanabh Jaini's 95th birthday celebration yesterday at the University of California in Berkeley. In 1972, Jaini left Michigan for Berkeley, and I became his replacement in Michigan. He is a giant in the fields of Buddhist and Jain Studies, and it was wonderful to see the love of his students and colleagues for him.
