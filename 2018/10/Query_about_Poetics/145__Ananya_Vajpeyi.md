Dear Colleagues,

I wondered if there is a preferred English-language term used currently to
replace “poetician” when referring to writers on poetics / literary and
aesthetic theory / literary criticism / figures of speech in the Sanskrit
traditions of Alankara Sastra and Kavya Sastra. I find “poetician” somewhat
dated and I’ve never really seen it used outside of Indological
scholarship.

Please advise.

Thank you,

Ananya Vajpeyi.
