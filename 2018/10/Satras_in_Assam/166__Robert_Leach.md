Dear list members,

A friend of mine would like to produce a photographic documentary on
Satras in Assam (Majuli Island) and is looking for scholarship on the
topic. He is particularly interested in the ordination system, the
monastic discipline and the social role that the monastery may play on
the island. This is not my area of expertise and I would be very
grateful to you if you could point me to any relevant bibliography on
the subject.

I thank you very much in advance for your kind help!

Best,
Jessie Pons
