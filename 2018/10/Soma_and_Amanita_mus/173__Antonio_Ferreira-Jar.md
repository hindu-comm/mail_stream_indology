Dear Jonathan,

I would also recommend Prof Harry Falk:
https://www.academia.edu/2097761/Soma_I_and_II
https://www.academia.edu/3569584/more_on_Soma

& Prof Albrecht Wezler's chapter in Aldous Huxley Between East and
West edited by C. C. Barfoot:
"Psychadelic Drugs as Means to Mystical Experience" pp.191ff
(should be available on Google Books in your region)

Kind regards,
Antonio
