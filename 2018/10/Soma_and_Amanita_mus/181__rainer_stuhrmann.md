Dear George and Georges,

actually already Grassmann in his Wörterbuch on the very first page has 
taken aMSu- as the name of the plant:

„NamederPflanze,auswelcherderSomasaftgepresstwurde...Also:1)Somapflanze,..".

For a discussion of the word and related terms and also for further 
references to the literature, see my article
"Rigvedische Lichtaufnahmen: Soma botanisch, pharmakologisch, in den 
Augen der Kavis"
(Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies (EJVS) 13-1, April 2006, 1-93.) 
p.22ff,
for a discussion of all the colour attributes of Soma, that are clearly 
not metaphoric in the RV,
p. 31-37, and for the effects of Soma which are not ephedrine-like, pp. 
44-71.

Rainer Stuhrmann
