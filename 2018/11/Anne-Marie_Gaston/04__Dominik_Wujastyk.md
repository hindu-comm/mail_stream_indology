I just learned today that Anne-Marie passed away earler this year.  An
obiturary can be read here
<http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ottawacitizen/obituary.aspx?n=anne-marie-gaston&pid=188737504>.
Anne-Marie and I learned Sanskrit together from Alexis and Richard, at
Oxford in the 70s.  She was incredibly energetic and positive, and a super
companion student.  May she rest in peace.
