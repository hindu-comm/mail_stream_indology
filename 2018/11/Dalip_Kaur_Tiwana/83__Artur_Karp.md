Dear Friends,

Dalip Kaur Tiwana's  "Within without":

I am looking - so far unsuccessfully - for the translation of the poem from
the original Punjabi into English. Is there any?

Regards,

Artur Karp (ret.)
Chair of South-Asian Studies
University of Warsaw
Poland

PS. Would anyone want to read my - so far unpublished - translation of the
poem into Polish?

Artur
