Actually, the object is botched in the manner of many Chinese manufactured objects drawing on esoteric Buddhist motifs. It has nothing to do with Tibetan. The central mantra is supposed to be Oṃ ma ṇi pa dme hūṃ svā hā, but in fact, if read clockwise it is

Oṃ dme pa ṇi ma hūṃ svā hā, or if read counterclockwise

Oṃ hā svā hūṃ  ma ṇi pa dme .

In other words, wrong either way.


The longer surrounding dhāraṇī in a sort of funky devanāgarī I've not tried to sort out.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Small dish with Ranjana inscription

Dear McComas,
This is a typical Buddhist votive object with Sinitic nāgarī script. The eight petals: oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ (counter-clockwise) and the bīja letter hrīḥ in the center. The outer ring must be another dhāraṇī. Tony Lin has a number of works in Chinese discussing all these objects. I am happy to share the bibliography if it is of interest to you.

Dear Colleagues

I wonder if any of you multi-talented folk can help me read the inscription on this small Chinese ceramic from the Ardebil shrine?

Yours sincerely
