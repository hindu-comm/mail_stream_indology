Dear Palaniappan,

The Chinese translates as “statue of unity.”

团结的雕像 tuanjie de diaoxiang = “Statue of Unity”

Broken down:
团结 tuanjie = to unite, unity, solidarity, united.
的 de = possessive marker
雕像 diaoxiang = statue

The terrible rendering in Tamil became widely ridiculed on the Web. Some wondered if it was a photoshopped joke. But BBC Tamil <https://www.bbc.com/tamil/india-46054914> has confirmed that it is true and shows a picture with attempted erasure of the Tamil version after the problem was brought to the attention of the authorities. The designer of the plaque was Larsen & Toubro. Can other language experts comment on the other versions on the plaque?
