Well, to start with, the "Russian" is merely the English transcribed into
the Cyrillic alphabet -- as are the Hindi, Gujarati, and (I think) the
Urdu, but not the Bangla ("ekataa muurti"), French, and Spanish. Hard to

The selection of languages seems to have been made on the basis of some
list of the most widely spoken languages in the world/in India.
