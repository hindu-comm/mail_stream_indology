Dear Members of the Indology list,

It is appropriate in this connection that I point out the following: Dr. 
Bagchee signs his messages with

> Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München

To avoid any possible misunderstandings: I wish to make it absolutely 
clear that Dr. Bagchee is not affiliated in any way whatsoever with the 
Institut für Indologie und Tibetologie of the 
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.

I believe that the members of the Indology List should be informed of 
this.
