About the book

***

This book presents a concise outline of the classical Tamil language for 
students with a focus on the literature of the first millennium, most 
notably that of the Caṅkam. It covers not only morphology but also 
syntax, an area which has long been neglected in Tamil studies. The 
presentation deviates from earlier works also in that the author neither 
describes classical Tamil through the lens of the modern language nor 
makes an attempt to remain faithful to the views of the traditional 
discipline of grammar (/ilakkaṇam/), but instead follows closely the 
usage of the Tamil texts as they were actually transmitted. Two folding 
sheets, at the beginning and at the end of the book, give an overview of 
early Tamil literature and verb morphology. For easy reference this 
grammar contains lists of suffixes and of grammatical terms, besides an 
index of quotations and a selective bibliography.
