South Asia Books is still in business through Amazon. I ordered a book from
them through Amazon on Nov. 13. On Nov. 15 I got an email from Amazon
saying that the book had shipped. The book arrived on Nov. 20, sent
directly from South Asia Books, 2204 Nellwood Dr., Columbia, Missouri 65202
(so said the return address label). It was not done through Amazon
fulfillment.

Best regards,

David Reigle
