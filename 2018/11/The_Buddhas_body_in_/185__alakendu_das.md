Dr.Karp,I apologise for being a little late in citing a probable reference vis-a-vis your query.I could access my library
only yesterday evening,where I came across the book"The Vedantic Buddhism of Buddha"by J.G.Gennings(Oxford University Press ,1948).Pg 427 of the book gbrings out the fact,that after Buddha's Mahaparinirvana,HIS body was first wrapped in unsoiled garment and cotton,and then laid on an oil-trough to form the pyre.This has reference in the Khudda Nikaya of the Sutta pitaka.The word Teli-Dona implies oil-trough.Alakendu Das.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Buddha's body in a vat of oil

pali tela-doni, sanskrit taila-droni.
Was the body placed in cold - or hot oil?
Any mention of the oil's temperature in the accessible sources?
