Additional references to this practice are to be found in the Rāmāyaṇa and its commentaries. In addition to the to the previously noted case of Daśaratha, there is the episode from the Uttarakāṇḍa in which Rāma instructs Lakṣmaṇa to have the body of the dead brahman child placed in a droṇa of oil  including fragrances and aromatic oils specifically so that it would not undergo decomposition of disintegration while Rāma  searches his kingdom for the person whose offense he has been told is the cause of this untimely (and remediable)  death.  (VR 7.66.2–4.)

Also unnoticed, and perhaps bearing on the exact sense of the term droṇa in this context is the Uttarakāṇḍa’s cautionary  tale of King Nimi as narrated at the critical edition’s APP. I, No. 8 lines 192–193.   (a passage which Dr. Sutherland Goldman and I  have restored to the text of our translation as VR 7. 5–5*.11). According to the legend, when Nimi was cursed to become disembodied, his court brahmins, servants and subjects  preserved (rakṣanti sma) his body and worshiped it with fragrances and garlands, again evidently as a means of preventing its decay. The text does not specify how the body is preserved but three commentators on the passage, Mādhava Yogīndra, Govindarāja, and Nāgeśa, understand that the body was placed in some sort of vessel of oil (tailakaṭāhādāv iti śeṣaḥ) perhaps suggesting that they, at least,  read droṇa in the other passages to refer to a vat rather than a specific measure. 

P.V Kane discusses this practice briefly on pp. 233–234 of  Vol. 4 of his History of Dharmaśāstra, citing the Rāmāyaṇa example of Daśaratha as well as a few others from the Viṣṇūpurāṇa (the Nimi story) and the sūtra literature.

In both cases it should be understood not in the sense of "a barrel of oil," but rather "ten litres of oil."  A droṇa is a unit of measure (see Roots of Ayurveda "Śarṅgadhara on weights measures and definitions."  A droṇa is not exactly ten litres, but roughly so.
