There is an article "Aspects of caesarian section in India" By Horace J. Pole and and Philip Q. Roche in JAOS, Vol. 59, p. 17ff. I cannot access it from home so can't give a summary.

I ask on behalf of a friend of mine who works in the history of medicine and has little knowledge of South Asian medical history: can anyone share references to pre-modern (ideally pre-second millennium CE) descriptions of caesarean sections in South Asian literature?
I'd be very grateful for any pointers...
Many thanks in advance!
