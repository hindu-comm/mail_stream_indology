Dear Rosane,
Thanks for the correction, and my apologies. I was sleepy. I am of course intensely aware of Poleman, and a great regret of mine is that the files on his initial purchasing trip to Southern Asia for the Library of Congress, and the chronological file for his entire career there, were not preserv3rd.
Allen
