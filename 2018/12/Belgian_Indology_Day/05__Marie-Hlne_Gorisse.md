Dear colleagues and friends,


We are delighted to announce that this year meeting of Belgian Indologists
will take place at Ghent University on Friday December 21st and will honor
the work of Prof. Adriaan Scharpé.


Please find below and attached the programme of the day.


This day will also be the occasion of the opening of an exhibition in honor
of professor Scharpé. This summer, the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy
library of Ghent University received the donation of the most valuable
private book collection of Adriaan Scharpé, professor of Indology at Ghent
University from 1944 to 1980. In addition, in the coming academic year, we
celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the “Hoger Instituut
voor Oosterse, Oosteuropese en Afrikaanse Taalkunde en Geschiedenis”, out
of which our department and course program developed, under the presidency
of Adriaan Scharpé.


We look forward to welcoming you back in Ghent!
