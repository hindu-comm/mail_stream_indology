Continuing my Krishna verses

अद्वितीये हरौ लोकेऽभेद: कृष्णबिडालयो: ।
नम कृष्णं बिडालं वा केशवो लभते नतिम् ।।
With Krishna being the one and only reality in the world, there is no
difference between Krishna and a cat. Offer your salutations to Krishna or
to a cat, and Krishna is sure to receive it.
