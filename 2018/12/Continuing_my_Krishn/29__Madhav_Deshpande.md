Continuing my Krishna verses

वाक्यं रसात्मकं काव्यं रसो नास्ति हरिं विना ।
तस्मात् कृष्णात्मकं वाक्यं काव्यमित्यभिधीयते ।।६०४।।
An expression that has delight as its essence is said to be poetic. There
is no delight without Krishna. Therefore, an expression that has Krishna as
its essence is said to be poetic.
