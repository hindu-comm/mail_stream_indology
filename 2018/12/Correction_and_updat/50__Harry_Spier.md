I use the FontCreator program from Hi-Logic which allows you to create open
type "contextual features".  I've used this feature. I use the professional
product which retails for $199.00 but their website says that the Home
edition for $79.00 also has this feature (but the home edition cannot be
used for commercial purposes).  The program only works on windows.

I have this book. (Unfortunately its in storage in New York). Its been 20
years since I looked at it but I recall it was absolutely fascinating.  As
I recall  one volume gives examples of devanagari printing from the
earliest printed editions up till fairly modern times (when it was
published), another volume  describes the authors ideas for a devanagari
typewriter and the third volume focuses on some esoteric ideas of the
author.  I can't recall the details.
