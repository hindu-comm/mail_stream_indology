Dear all,

the data of the DCS are now open source.

You find a download link and additional information on how to 
build/explore the database on github (folder dcs):

https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit

The user interface of the corpus will probably be migrated to a new 
server in the next weeks.

Best, Oliver
