H.C. Bhayani has an essay in vol. 1 of his "Indological Studies" (Ahmedabad
1993) titled "The Apabhraṁśa Passages from Abhinavagupta’s Tantrasāra and
Parātriṁśikāvṛtti" (pp. 276–296), originally published in 1971 in Vidyā 14
(2): 1–18. There he attempts to correct/rewrite the 32 Apabhramsha passages
in the Tantrasāra are the 7 Apabhramsha saṅgrahaślōkas in the
Parātriṁśikāvṛtti. I don't have a soft copy, but he says there (p. 293)
“there is nothing specifically *dialectal *or *regional* or ‘Kashmirian’
about Abhinavagupta’s Apabhraṁśa.” Prof. Bhayani also noted that the text
of these verses as printed in the KSTS edition (in 1918, when Apabhramsha
studies were in their infancy) is "a chaotic jumble of letters from which
it seems near-impossible to make out any connected verbal structure or
palpable meaning." I remember hearing that Paul Gerstmayr was working on
these verses at one point.
