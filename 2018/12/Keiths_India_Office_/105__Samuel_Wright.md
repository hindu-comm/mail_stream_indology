Dear List,

I am looking for a scan of Volume 2, Part 1 of:

'Catalogue of the Sanskrit and Prakrit Manuscripts in the Library of the
India Office.' Volume II: Brahmanical and Jaina Manuscripts.'
A. Berriedale Keith. With a Supplement, Buddhist Manuscripts, by F. W.
Thomas. Part I, Nos. 4204 to 6627. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1935 [?].

I am not able to find this online, surprisingly. Might someone have a scan
they can share?

Many thanks,
Sam
