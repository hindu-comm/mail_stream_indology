Archana Venkatesan posted a beautiful photo of a cat on the procession
palanquin of Nanguneri Perumal. I composed a few verses describing the
friendship of the cat and Krishna.

कृष्णवर्णो बिडालोऽयं श्रीकृष्णनिकटे स्थित: ।
उभौ कृष्णौ तत: प्रीतिस्तयो: स्वाभाविकी खलु ।।
This dark cat sits next to Krishna. They are both dark, and so their mutual
affection is natural.
कृष्णस्य साहचर्येण बिडाल: कृष्णतां गत: ।
साहचर्याद् बिडालस्य कृष्णो याति बिडालताम् ।।
With Krishna's association, the cat turned into Krishna, and with the
association of the cat, Krishna became the cat.
बिडालकृष्णयोरत्र नास्ति भेद: कथञ्चन ।
एकस्य वासुदेवस्य द्वे रूपे पुरतो मम ।।
There is no difference whatsoever between Krishna and the cat. These are
just two forms of Krishna in front of me.
