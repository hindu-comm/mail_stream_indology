Dear Colleagues,

After I taught David Shulman's "More Than Real" last semester in a graduate
course, a student of mine has become extremely interested in exploring the
idea of 'imagination'/'philosophy of mind' in the early Tamil literary
traditions. He is finally planning to do his graduate thesis on the same
topic. Of course the first thing I recommended was Schulman's new arrival
"Tamil - A Biography".  I shall be highly grateful for an exhaustive list
of recommendations for both of us.

Thanks in advance.

Mrinal
