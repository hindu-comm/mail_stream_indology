Yes, Madhav. That was my first guess also. Since the commentary is from Kashmir, perhaps it is a Kashmiri vernacular??

Dear Patrick,

     I wonder if this is Sanskritization of a vernacular word.  In Marathi, when something (including stomach) is feeling bloated, the expression is तट्ट फुगणे, तटतटणे.

Dear All:

A colleague who is not on the list had a question regarding the meaning of “tanaṭitā” in the commentary on the term “stabdhā” of verse 11. The passage is from Sushruta-samhita, uttaratantra chapter 38, with Dalhana’s commentary. Thankful for any leads. With best wishes,

Patrick
