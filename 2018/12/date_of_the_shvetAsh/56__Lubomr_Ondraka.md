Dear Colleagues,

is there any serious attempt to date the Śvetāśvataropaniṣadbhāṣya attributed to Śaṅkarācārya? Already  the editors of this text (AAS 17) list several reasons why this work cannot be written by Śaṅkara and almost all scholars accept this view. So it seems there is a scholarly consensus that this is a late text, but I did not find any discussion on the date of this work.

Thanks,
Lubomir
