In some sources, I have seen a reference to a work of Jagannāthapaṇḍita
titled Śabdakaustubha-śāṇottejana.  This is evidently a critique of
Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's Śabdakaustubha.  I don't have access to the volume of
NCC that may contain information regarding this text.  If anyone has any
information regarding this text or its manuscripts, please let me know.
With best regards,
