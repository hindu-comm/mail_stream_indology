Dear list members,
Recently I came across the following article by Kamil. V. Zvelebil, "Translating Old Tamil Poetry: Some Suggestions". It would have appeared in The Collected Papers on Classical Tamil Literature in the Journal of 'Tamil Culture'", ed. by D. Sivaganesh (Ceṉṉai 2001), pp. 150-7, 174-80. As I never had the opportunity to stay for a longer period in Tamilnadu, I am  unfamiliar with many books and publications which have appeared there. I hope someone on the list will be able to provide me with more information about these publications, both the journal Tamil Culture as well as the edited volume by Sivaganesh, and about their availability.
With kind regards,
Herman
