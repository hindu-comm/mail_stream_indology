ShankarAcharya ,as has been known , wrote commentaries on Ten Upanishads,namely Isa,Kena,Katha,Prashna,Mandukya,Mandukya,Taiterriya,Aitteriya,Chhandognya,and BrahadAryanaka.The karika,also goes something like this-"IsaKenaKathaPrashnaMandukyaMandukaTittiriAitteriyaChhandognyaVrahadAranyakaDASHAUpanishadamYatha." It would be interesting to know if ShankarAcharya wrote any commentary on Swataswatara . Alakendu Das.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] date of the Śvetāśvataropaniṣadbhāṣya

Dear Colleagues,



is there any serious attempt to date the Śvetāśvataropaniṣadbhāṣya attributed to Śaṅkarācārya? Already the editors of this text (AAS 17) list several reasons why this work cannot be written by Śaṅkara and almost all scholars accept this view. So it seems there is a scholarly consensus that this is a late text, but I did not find any discussion on the date of this work.



Thanks,

Lubomir
