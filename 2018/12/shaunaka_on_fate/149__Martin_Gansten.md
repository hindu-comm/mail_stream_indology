The 17th-century astrologer Balabhadra in both his magna opera quotes 
(as pūrvapakṣa) a stanza in Āryā metre apparently supporting fatalism 
and attributed to Śaunaka:

yena tu yat prāptavyaṃ tasya vidhānaṃ sureśasacivo ’pi |
yaḥ sākṣān niyatijñaḥ so ’pi na śakyo ’nyathā kartum ||

'Whatever anyone is to meet with, not even the counsellor of the lord of 
gods, who has direct knowledge of destiny, is able to alter his fate.'

I should be grateful for any suggestions as to what work(s) attributed 
to Śaunaka might be referred to here (educated guesses welcome). It 
would be even better, of course, if someone happened actually to know 
the origin of the stanza.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
