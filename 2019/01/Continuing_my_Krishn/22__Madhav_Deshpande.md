Continuing my Krishna verses

अनन्तकल्याणगुणो धवो माप्रीतिभाजनम् ।
अनन्तकल्याणगुणा मा धवप्रीतिभाजनम् ।।६२७।।
Possessed of infinite auspicious qualities, Krishna/Vishnu is the beloved
husband of Lakshmi [Mā], and possessed of infinite auspicious qualities,
Lakshmi is the beloved of her husband Krishna/Vishnu.
