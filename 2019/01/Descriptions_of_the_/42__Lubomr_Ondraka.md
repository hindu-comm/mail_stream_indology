Dear Harry,

an old classic, The Daily Practice of the Hindus: Containing the morning and midday duties, by Srisa Chandra Vasu (rev. ed, published in 1909), has three chapters on sandhyā by "Rig Vedins, Sāma-Vedins, and Yajur-Vedins". I think this book may serve you as a starting point in your inquiry.
