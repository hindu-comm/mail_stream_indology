Here are images of a ms in ASR possibly handwritten by HRR Iyengar 1930's
Mysore (pramanasamuccaya
Samskrit text). Though it is titled as pramanasamuccaya, it seems to be
translation of something vijnaptimatrata text.
If anyone is aware of its publication, please let me know. It will help us
cataloguing this.
