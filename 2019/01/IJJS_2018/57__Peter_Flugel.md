Author: Colette Caillat. Translated from the French by Brianne Donaldson

In this translated essay, originally published in French, Colette Caillat
offers an analysis of the Tandulaveyāliya, one of the diverse
Prakīrṇaka-sūtras in the Svetāmbara Jain canon. This unique medical
treatise fuses ancient Jain teachings found in the Bhagavatī-sūtra (Pkt.
Viyāhapannatti) andSūtrakṛtānga-sūtra (Pkt. Sūyagaḍaṅga) with more
contemporary Indian medical treatises such as the Caraka- and
Suśruta-saṃhitās, offering greater detail on the formation of
embryos—including maternal/paternal contributions, gender, nutrition, and
stages of development, as well as the difficulty of pregnancy.

Water Clock and Steelyard in the Jyotiṣkaraṇḍaka

*Saṃkhyā-jñāna*, the science of numbers, plays an important role in Jainism
which seeks to comprehend the universe numerically. *Kāla-jñāna* or
*kāla-vibhāga* is an important part of saṃkhyā-jñāna, for time too has to
be comprehended in numbers. The Jainas measured time conceptually in
microscopic units and in macroscopic units, but for practical purposes,
early Jain texts like the *Sūrya-prajñapti* employ a five-year cycle and
provide diverse kinds of astronomical parameters for this period.

A related Jain text *Jyotiṣkaraṇḍaka* introduces an interesting variation
into the time measurement and speaks of the “volume” and “weight” of the
time. In this context, the text describes two tools of measurement, a water
clock and a steelyard, i.e. a balance with a single pan. Descriptions of
such instruments are rare in Indian literature; this paper presents a
cultural study of these two measuring instruments.
