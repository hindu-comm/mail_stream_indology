Dear List,

To those who are interested, I should like to mention a recent article on the Caraka Saṃhitā and its commentarial tradition, published in the most recent issue of eJIM: http://www.indianmedicine.nl:
Sanskrit Medical Scholasticism —Jajjaṭa’s Nirantarapadavyākhyā and Other Commentaries on the Carakasaṃhitā, Cikitsāsthāna 2.1—
Kenneth G. Zysk and Tsutomu Yamashita
All the best,
Ken
