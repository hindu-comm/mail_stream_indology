Dear list members,

Would anyone have scans of these papers:

V. Ch. Bhattacharyya, 'Application of Ṛgveda mantras rubricated in the 
Aitareya-Brāhmaṇa', Our Heritage, 1 (Calcutta 1953)

V. Ch. Bhattacharyya, 'An aspect of justification of Ṛk-mantras in the 
AiB., Our Heritage', 3 (Calcutta 1955)

"Our Heritage" is apparently hard to find.

Best regards and many thanks in advance,
Dominik Haas
