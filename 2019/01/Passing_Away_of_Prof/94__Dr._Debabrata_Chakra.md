I am sorry to inform the learned circle that my friend Prof. Dr. Chlodwig Werba of the South Asian Institute of Indoloy & Tibetan Studies in Vienna has died a premature death on 25 January 2019. We miss not only an outstanding scholar of Indology, but a man of intense feeling and a heart full of humour. May he attain Sadgati.
