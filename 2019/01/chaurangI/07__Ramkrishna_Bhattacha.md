Dear Sellmer,
I think you're in the right track. The name of the siddha in Bangla is C
auraṅgī . What is now the Esplanade area in central Kolkata was previously
known as Cauraṅgī (distorted to Chauringhee). The main road that connects
central Kolkata and south Kolkata was originally known as Cauraṅgī or
Chauringhee Road. It has been renamed Jawaharlal Nehru Road or Sarani.
There is a brief life-sketch of this siddha in the
*Caturas'iti-siddha-prav.ritti*.  In the Bangla translation the name is
spelt Cauraṅga.
Yours collegially,
Ramkrishna Bhattacharya,
3, Mohanlal Street, Kolkata 700 004, India.
