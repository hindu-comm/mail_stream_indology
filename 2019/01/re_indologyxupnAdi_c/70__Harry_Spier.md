Why then do we have sūrya-nadī instead of sūrya-ṇadī,(from Monier-Williams)
?

Similarily also from Monier-Williams: why  sūrya-nakṣatra, sūrya-nārāyaṇa,
sūrya-namaskāra, sūrya-netra instead of , sūrya-ṇakṣatra, sūrya-ṇārāyaṇa,
sūrya-ṇamaskāra, sūrya-ṇetra

I've just now seen what Whitney writes: "This rule applies strictly and
especially when the nasal and the cause of its alteration lie within the
limits of the same integral word; but it is extended , within certain
limits, to compound words'.

What does he mean by "[applies] within certain limits to compound words."
Does he mean all compounds not containing  a word from gaṇa kṣubhnādi or
are there other restrictions to its application in compounds?

Thanks,
