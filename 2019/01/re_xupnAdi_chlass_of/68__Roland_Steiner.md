Cf. Böhtlingk/Roth (PW) s.v. nagara: "Das na wird in keinem comp. ṇa  
nach gaṇa kṣubhnādi zu P. 8, 4, 39." ("The na is not cerebralized in a  
compound according to gaṇa kṣubhnādi ...").

Example: giri-nagara "mountain-city" (in contrast to  
giri-ṇadī/giri-nadī "mountain-torrent").

Best,
Roland Steiner
