Dear List,

The Heinrich-Heine-Institut in  DÃ¼sseldorf (Germany) is looking for someone
who might be able to help them a) transliterate and b) translate the text
on the cover of five books in Bengali, so that they can add them to their
library catalogue.

Having looked at the pages they sent me, I'd assume this would take 20-30
minutes. There is no money in it, just their gratitude and the knowledge
you have done something to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge.

I have attached jpgs of two of the pages in question, but am not sure
whether they will make it onto the List. If you are willing to help, please
get in touch and I will email you the rest.

Many thanks,
     Antonia
