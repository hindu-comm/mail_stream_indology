Dear list members,

I am working on a very modest terminology and illustrated list of animals
that occur in Buddhism. Unfortunately one, the Chinkara a (small gazelle)
which repeatedly appears to either side of the Dharmachakra in most
sculptures oof the first turning, does not appear to have a verifiable
Sanskrit name. In essence, it is the "deer" of the 'deer park' translation
of "má¹›gadava."

The creature depicted does not (or *very* rarely) has branched antlers (a
deer characteristic) but gently curving horns which it does not shed (an
antelope gazelle characteristic).

My sincere appreciation for any help or references.

Best to all

John
