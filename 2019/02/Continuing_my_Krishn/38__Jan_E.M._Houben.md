Nice balance of regular pathyā anuṣṭhubh ślokas and rare permitted
deviations:
here (648) the na-vipulā in a and c give it a 'magic' touch;
followed by the next verse (649) with bha-vipulā in c:
हृदि ज्वलति कृष्णाग्नि: कृष्णचन्द्रोऽपि मे हृदि ।
कृष्णेन तप्तं हृदयं कृष्ण: शमयते करै: ।।६४९।।
The fire of Krishna burns in my heart, but the moon of Krishna also shines
in my heart.
Krishna calms my heart suffering for Krishna with his own hands.
As for karaiḥ in 649c, as it is intended as 'hands', apparently of the
personal Krishna, a strict application of Pāṇini (AA 1.4.22 dvyekayor
dvivacanaikavacane) would inevitably lead to the form karābhyām, which,
however, would give a hypermetric pāda of 9 syllables, and hence a conflict
with the principle api māṣaṁ maṣaṁ kuryāt chandobhaṅgaṁ na kārayet, which,
although it is not Pāṇini, is rather strictly followed in classical poetry.
Since taptam corresponds to the fire in pāda a, one could have a pāda d
corresponding more explicitly with the moon in pāda b: Krishna brings peace
through the beams of the moon, the Soma-beams: aṁśubhiḥ, which, as
'ṁśubhiḥ, would fit the metre perfectly. An objection could then
nevertheless be that this gives an undesirable mixture of styles:
everywhere expressions that are beautiful because of their simplicity, and
here suddenly a 'learned' expression aṁśubhiḥ as moon- or Soma-beams. At
the end, we can, then, leave the verse as created by the Poet as it is, and
only change the translation: instead of "with his own hands" the
translation of karaiḥ should be "with is own 'hands', i.e. moon-rays": the
plural itself indicates that kara stands not for 'hands' but for the rays,
in this case of the moon in pāda b.
Best, Jan


aṁśubhiḥ
