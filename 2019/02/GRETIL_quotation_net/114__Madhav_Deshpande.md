Dear Sebastian,

     Congratulations for an amazing achievement.  I tested a few texts and
they worked well.  The one that did not open was Atharvaveda-Saṃhitā.  So
there may be a few glitches here and there.  I saw Bhartr̥hari's Śatakas.
Is the Vākyapadīya inculded?  I may have missed it in the long list.
     In any case, thank you so much for providing this wonderful resource.
With best wishes,

Madhav
