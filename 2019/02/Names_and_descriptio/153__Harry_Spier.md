Dear list members,

Would anyhow have or be able to point to articles or lists of names and
descriptions of weapons in sanskrit.  In particular names and descriptions
of   weapons  described as being held in the hands of gods and goddesses
.in the different stotras and descriptions of those deities.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
