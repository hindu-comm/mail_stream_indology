Dear Harry Spier
I don't know whether this information is useful or not, but,  I remember
reading that, majority of the reference from Mahabharata in Böhtlingk Roth,
is untraceable in any editions is said by Charudeva Sastry. Even after
decoding the reference number the challenge is not over.
A tip to decode the reference number is reverse working. Finding a famous
known verse from Mahabharata and searching that in Böhtlingk Roth
Regards
KP
