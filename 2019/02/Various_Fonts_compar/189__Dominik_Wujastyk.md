I *really* like the Vani Vilas font.  It has the little tiny inter-aksara
spaces in the matra line.  And look at the word durlabha दुर्लभ near the
end of the passage: Vani Vilas is the only one that manages that rl+bha
elegantly.  It's stunning.  I'm normally unwavering about my preference for
Sanskrit 2003, but Vani Vilas may be taking the throne.  Does it support
complex conjuncts, kārtsnya, ṣaṭtriṃśat, prasanna, śakti, etc.?
