Hi Arlo,

According to my Indian Epigraphy book, pp. 200ff,  the earliest
"publication" -- in some sense of the term, in this case consisting only of
a translation -- of a Sanskrit inscription was by Charles Wilkins in
1788.The earliest full publication, including facsimile and transliterated
text, was by Henry Colebrook in 1801. At least, these were the earliest
publications that I was able to find.
