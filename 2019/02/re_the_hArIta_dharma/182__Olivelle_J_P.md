See Kane’s History of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. 1, pp. 127–136 for the Hārīta Dharmasūtra, with further bibliography and attempts to reconstruct it by S. C. Banerjee. Kane also mentions your 30-ch version, a ms. of which was found in Nasik by Islampurkar.

Dear all,

I've fallen into a bit of a rabbit hole looking into the dharmasūtra/dharmaśāstra attributed to Hārīta. Julius Jolly, in 1896, writes about a 17th-century manuscript of this text, complete in 30 chapters:

https://books.google.ca/books?id=RhsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false

But it does not seem to have ever been published. However, I found this 1994 book that seems to make reference to specific passages from the 30th chapter of the Hārīta Dharmasūtra:

https://books.google.ca/books?id=idERT6Tg4MMC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39#v=onepage&q&f=false

This definitely seems to be referring to the abovementioned 30-chapter text, rather than to shorter works attributed to Hārīta (such as the Hārītasaṃhitā, Laghuhārītasmṛti, Vṛddhahārītasmṛti, etc.) Does anyone know if any work has been done on the Hārīta Dharmasūtra in the past hundred years or so? Jolly published a collection of quotations from it in 1890 (Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 18), but I have been unable to access it.

Thanks,

Charles
