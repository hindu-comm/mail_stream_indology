Dear Professors,

Since Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga follows closely the Vimuttimagga in many
respects, I would presume it also inherits the latter's terminology. In the
Vism yogin occurs 63 times, yogāvacara 29 times, yogācāra only once. The
English term "meditator" occurs 112 times in Ñāṇamoli's translation of the
Vism, which means "yogin" and " yogāvacara" are likely used
interchangeably. But I am not sure why 坐禪人 occurs so many times in the
Vimuttimagga. I would guess the Chinese translator put the subject of the
sentences, either implied or mentioned using a pronoun in the original,
explicit in Chinese.

With best wishes,
Lin Qian
