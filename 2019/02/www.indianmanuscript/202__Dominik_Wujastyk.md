This website, that hosted digital scans of many manuscripts and early
editions, has now disappeared, as of December last year.   Some of the site
is preserved at Archive.org
<https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.indianmanuscripts.com/>, but the
scans are not downloadable as far as I can see.  The site was created by a
Mr Madan Mohan Gupta.  I am guessing, but I think the resource might be
associated with Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, or the Bishno Mandir in Hisar,
Haryana.

Does anyone have any information about this resource, especially whether it
has gone forever or only temporarily?  I wrote to Mr Gupta last year,
congratulating him on the website, but I received no answer.

Best,
Dominik
