I was surprised to read this, Dominik, as I successfully accessed the 
site just over a week ago, on 7 February. I didn't try to download 
anything; I merely wanted to check that it was indeed still up and 
running. On checking again just now, though, I can't find it. Dṛṣṭaṃ 
vinaṣṭam atilolam alātacakram...
