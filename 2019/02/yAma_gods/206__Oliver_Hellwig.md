Dear all,

I'm looking for a study dealing with the group of gods called yāma, who 
are mentioned quite often in Buddhist texts. Two points would be of 
special relevance:
a) When is this group first mentioned?
b) Which gods are typically subsumed under this name?

Any help, including early, possibly pre-Buddhist textual references, is 
highly appreciated!

Best, Oliver
