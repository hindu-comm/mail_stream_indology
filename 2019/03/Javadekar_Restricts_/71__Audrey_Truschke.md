Dear Colleagues,

Those who follow news on higher education in India may be interested in
Prakash Javadekar restricting PhD topics
<https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahul-gandhi-slams-prakash-javadekar-for-restricting-phd-topics/articleshow/68552157.cms>
to subjects in line with "national priorities." The new directive has
prompted at least one Indian academic to resign
<https://scroll.in/latest/917720/kerala-academic-quits-after-hrd-says-researchers-to-pursue-phd-only-on-topics-of-national-interest>
already.

Some of you may remembers Javadekar, who inaugurated the World Sanskrit
Conference <https://wsc.ubcsanskrit.ca> last year in Vancouver.

Audrey Truschke
Assistant Professor
