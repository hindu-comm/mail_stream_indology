HOWEVER, if we accept the verse without emendation, should not we read it
in the way the author KNEW that 99 percent of his contemporaneous readers
would read it?


The verse you quoted:



janmalagnapatir uttamavīryo yadgṛhe januṣi tatra ca dṛṣṭe |
tena vā *sahita asya* ca labdhis tad yathāṅgasukham abdatanau syāt ||

The translation you proposed (I supply the words on which each part is
based, if I understand your analysis and interpretation correctly):

***

As the meaning is quite technical, I give my translation:

'If the house in which (yadgṛhe) the ruler of the ascendant of the nativity
(janmalagnapatir) is [placed] with excellent strength (uttamavīryo) in the
nativity is aspected (tatra ... dṛṣṭe) or (vā) joined by that [ruler] (tena
... *sahite*), [there is] attainment (labdhis) of [the matter signified by]
that [house] (asya): for example (tad yathā), [if it is placed] in the
ascendant of the year (abdatanau), there will be (syāt) be pleasures of the
body (aṅgasukham).'

***



Now, reading the verse – if specialists familiar with the text agree there
is no reason to propose any ad hoc emendation – with similar conceptual
interpretations BUT in the way the author KNEW that 99 percent of his
contemporaneous readers would read it (and paying more attention to the two
*ca*’s, and letting both *tatra* and *tena* refer anaphorically to *yadg**ṛ*
*he*) we get something that perhaps amounts to the same but is based on a
different *anvaya*... :



If in a house *(yadgṛhe)* in a nativity (januṣi) the ruler of the ascendant
of the nativity (janmalagnapatir) is having excellent strength, *and* *[ca,
extending the noun phrase] *is there *(tatra)* [in that house, positively]
aspected, or if [the ruler...] is (if not placed in that house, at least)
joined (*sahita**[ḥ]*) with it *(tena)* [with the house], then *also [ca,
perhaps referring to a statement in a previous verse, other conditions
favouring labdhis?]* [there is] attainment of [the matter signified by]
that [house] (asya): for example (tad yathā), [if it is placed] in the
ascendant of the year (abdatanau), there will be (syāt) pleasures of the
body (aṅgasukham).


Bottom line: the use of square (and round) brackets is very much required
when analysing Sanskrit especially in scientific or philosophical arguments
-- as in the publication by Vincent Eltschinger, John Taber, Michael
Torsten Much, Isabelle Ratié on *Dharmakīrti’s Theory of Exclusion* recently
announced for "those among you who are still happy with square brackets".


Best,

Jan Houben
