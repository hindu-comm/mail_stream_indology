The copper plate inscription (single) avagrahaḥ shows that even in the 9th century CE it could mark assimilation of at least ā + a. We cannot infer from this example, however, that double avagrahaḥ marking assimilation is an ancient usage. The only uses of double avagrahaḥ I’ve seen are in colonial period and later printed texts and in manuscripts copied from printed texts. These sources are not “quite old”.
