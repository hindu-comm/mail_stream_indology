Thank you for your suggestion and interest, Jan. It is very refreshing 
to be allowed to discuss the technical meaning of Sanskrit astrological 
texts for once.

Your analysis of my translation is absolutely correct. However, I cannot 
help wondering how you know that the author 'KNEW that 99 percent of his 
contemporaneous readers' would understand /sahita asya/ to represent 
/sahitaḥ asya/ rather than /sahite asya/ (for that, as I understand it, 
is the nub of your argument). But even granting for the sake of argument 
that this should be so, the sense of the verse still requires, in my 
view, that we side with the 1 percent.

Your suggested translation has the ruler of the ascendant:

> there (tatra) [in that house, positively] aspected, or if [the 
> ruler...] is (if not placed in that house, at least) joined 
> (sahita[ḥ]) with it (tena) [with the house],

That is a rather long translation of six short words (tatra ca dṛṣṭe | 
tena vā sahita[ḥ]), and it has the presumed logical subject of the 
clause jumping from the earlier nominative (-patiḥ) to the locative 
(dṛṣṭe) and back again (sahitaḥ). More importantly, though, it conveys 
no real meaning, for a planet being joined with a house means nothing 
more or less than the planet occupying the house. This is a matter not 
only of established meaning (rūḍhi), but of lack of alternatives: what 
else could it mean? So I cannot agree with your suggestion.

Phrases meaning 'joined or aspected by' (often in compounds like 
yutekṣita, dṛṣṭayuk, etc.) are extremely common in astrological texts; 
the two typically go together and refer to the same subject (which may 
be a house, a planet, or some other point in the horoscope). To give 
just one example, consider the following stanza from the same work and 
chapter (12.47):

sute savīrye _śubhayuṅnirīkṣite_ suteśvare kendragate balānvite |
tathaiva sāde sutasaukhyam īritaṃ sutātyayaḥ syād viparītage tathā ||

'If the fifth house is strong, _joined or aspected by benefics_; if the 
ruler of the fifth house, endowed with strength, occupies an angle; and 
if the lot likewise [is strong and benefic], happiness from children is 
declared [as the result]. Likewise, if [all are] conversely situated, 
the death of a child will occur.'

It thus seems more natural to me to take the /sahita/ in /dṛṣṭe ... 
sahita asya/ to represent /sahite /(agreeing with /dṛṣṭe/) than 
/sahitaḥ/, even if we could find a translation to make sense of the 
latter alternative.

Best wishes,
Martin
