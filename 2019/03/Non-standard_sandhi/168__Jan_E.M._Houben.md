Dear Martin,
Thanks for the instructive clarification.
Clearly, I had imagined your author as a better author than he actually
was.
There is, then, perhaps only the very exceptional sandhi such as the one in
RV 8.72,5 paada c to "save" him (and that for either -e or -o + a- > -a +
a- according to MacDonell's comment on it) and his Taajika- (Persian?) text
on astrology.
Well, best of luck with the interpretation...
Jan
