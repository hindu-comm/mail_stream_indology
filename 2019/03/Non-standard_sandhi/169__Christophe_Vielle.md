There is maybe some parallel with what Renou Gram. p. 46 §41c (dealing with the sandhi of final -e/-o + vowels) notes about the "hiatus de a (issu du nomin. aḥ des thèmes en -a) devant initiale a- suivie de deux consonnes dans un texte bouddh[ique]", referring to Pischel SBBerl. 1904, p. 812, here:
https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/92836#page/890/mode/1up
ekacīvaraka asthāt instead of ekacīvarako 'sthāt
pṛṣṭa avyākṛtam instead of pṛṣṭo 'vyākṛtam
I mean (in asya) the presence of the two consonants following the initial a, which lenghtens the syllabe, and makes the initial a pronounced long, resulting in the fact that the final e here conforms with the "general" rule (becoming a(y) when followed by any vowel, except a, or diphtongue).
Conversely, the two consonants following a ā can make it considered as short, as Renou notes ibid. with the (mainly epic) occurrences of -o/-e  'tman for -a ātman.

I have a question for the vaiyākaraṇas among us (who may find it very basic, in which case I apologize in advance):

In the Tājikayogasudhānidhi of Yādavasūri (fl. possibly early 17th century, possibly in or near Gujarat) there occurs the following stanza (12.15), the form of which is corroborated by several independent witnesses:

janmalagnapatir uttamavīryo yadgṛhe januṣi tatra ca dṛṣṭe |
tena vā sahita asya ca labdhis tad yathāṅgasukham abdatanau syāt ||

(As the meaning is quite technical, I give my translation: 'If the house in which the ruler of the ascendant of the nativity is [placed] with excellent strength in the nativity is aspected or joined by that [ruler, there is] attainment of [the matter signified by] that [house]: for example, [if it is placed] in the ascendant of the year, there will be pleasures of the body.')

>From the context, the underlined phrase clearly stands for sahite + asya, with e > a. While this is standard sandhi before other vowels, I have never come across it before a. Is there a traditional rule that allows for  this?

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
