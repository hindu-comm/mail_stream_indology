Thank you, Harry. Most of these are just instances where sandhi has not 
been implemented, or (in the case of Veda) where a text has been 
metrically restored. From a quick glance, though, a few do seem to be 
possible instances of aá¸¥ + a > a a, and/or of e + a > a a. I will have 
to look more carefully.

Best wishes,
Martin
