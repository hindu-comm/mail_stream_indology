Nevertheless, the majority of these hits seem not to be instances of e > 
a or o > a sandhi. Also, comparing them with the saṃhitā text in 
Müller's edition, most of them are given either as ā (that is, a single 
vowel) or ā a, not as a a. A machine search for 'a a' may not be the 
optimal way of finding examples of this unusual sandhi.
