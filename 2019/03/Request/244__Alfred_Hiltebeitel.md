Dear Colleagues,

I would be very grateful if someone could supply me either with the
full Sanskrit text of  Kālidāsa’s Śākuntala, or just the Sanskrit of
the following verse from Śākuntala V, ramyāṇī vīkṣya:

You see something amazing, and it moves you.
You hear something wonderful, and it touches you.
You were happy, but now you’re restless.
Perhaps you’re remembering for the first time,
friendships still alive with feeling,
buried deep in your mind.

(from David Shulman´'s "Notes on Camatkāra"),

Thanks,
Alf Hiltebeitel
