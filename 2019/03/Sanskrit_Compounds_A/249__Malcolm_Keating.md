Does anyone have an e-version of Mulakaluri Srimannarayana Murti's
"Sanskrit Compounds: A Philosophical Study"? It was published as Chowkhamba
Sanskrit Series 93 in 1974 but was previously a dissertation. Either form
would be acceptable. I have checked Shodhganga and while it is listed, I do
not seem able to download it. The book is out of print and interlibrary
loan to Singapore takes some time.

Best,
Malcolm
