> The major first part of the paper collects as exhaustively as possible all
> mentions of words for ‘mirror’ occuring in Vedic literature (c.1200–300
> bce). The occurrences are presented with sufficient context in Sanskrit
> and English in order to show how and why the mirror was used in Vedic
> rituals and Vedic culture in general, and what meaning was ascribed to it.
> The second part of the paper discusses a fact of major significance that
> emerges from this documentation: in the extensive older Vedic literature
> of the Saṃhitās, Brāhmaṇas, Āraṇyakas and Śrautasūtras (excepting the late
> Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra), there is no reference to the mirror at all. This
> suggests that the mirror was not known in Vedic India until it was
> introduced to South Asia by the Persian Empire at the end of the sixth
> century bce. The later Vedic literature, starting with the early
> Upaniṣads and comprising also the Gṛhyasūtras and Kātyāyana-Śrautasūtra,
> would therefore postdate 500 bce. In other words, the ‘mirror’ words seem
> to offer a criterion that for the first time enables a division of the
> Vedic literature into two clearly separate phases of development. Equally
> important is the firm historical basis that the mirror provides for dating
> the transition point.
