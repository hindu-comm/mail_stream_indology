Dear Prof. Asko Parpola,

You rely for your dating on " the mirror was not known in Vedic India until
it was introduced to South Asia by the Persian Empire at the end of the
sixth century bce."

For this, you seem to rely just on the occurrence of words in texts.

But historians of mirror have said with enough non-textual evidences that
high tin bronze mirrors were known in India at least by  1000 BCE.
