Dear friends,

I am pleased to announce the publication of *Self, Sacrifice, and Cosmos:
Vedic Thought, Ritual, and Philosophy*, ed. Lauren M. Bausch (Delhi: Primus
<http://www.primusbooks.com/showbookdetail.asp?bookid=227> Books,
2019). 'Contributions
range widely across critical topics in early, middle, and late Vedic texts
and their commentaries, as well as classical themes in contemporary
Sanskrit literature. Essays elucidate the explanations and arguments found
in Brāhmaṇa texts, the historical and ecological development of Vedic
ritual, concepts and underlying messages in Vedic texts, anachronisms in
commentarial exegesis, and literary devices in narrative. From a variety of
philological, philosophical, ritual, gender, and literary approaches, these
articles shed new light on our understanding of these seminal texts of
Indian religion and philosophy. This book is dedicated to the life and work
of Professor G.U. Thite.'

In addition to a biography of Prof. Thite, the volume features eleven
articles by eminent scholars:

1.    Timothy Lubin, 'Brāhmaṇa as Commentary'
2.    Joanna Jurewicz, 'The Consistency of Vedic Argument'
3.    Ganesh Umakant Thite, 'The Role of Brāhmaṇa-texts in the Development
of Vedic Ritual'
4.    Stephanie W. Jamison, 'Vedic Ritual: The Sacralization of the Mundane
and the Domestication of the Sacred'
5.    Joel P. Brereton, 'The Heavenly Sea'
6.    Lauren M. Bausch, '*Pratiṣṭhā* in the Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas'
7.    Jarrod Whitaker, 'Women, Weapons, and Words: Gender and Sexuality in
the *Ṛgveda**’s "*Weapons Hymn" (6.75)'
8.    Caley Charles Smith, 'How is a Vehicular Homicide like the Sacrifice?'
9.    Robert P. Goldman, 'Creating Context: Ādiśaṅkarācārya’s Reading of
Three *Ākhyāyikās* of the *Chāndogya Upaniṣad'*
10.  Jan E.M. Houben, 'Ecology of Ritual Innovation in Ancient India:
Textual and Contextual Evidence'
11.   Laurie L. Patton, 'Sanskrit as Personality Development: Emotion and
Dialogue in the 20th Twentieth Century Writings of Kshama Rao'

It was an honor to edit this fabulous collection of papers, which I hope
you enjoy reading as much as I have.

With best wishes,
Lauren
