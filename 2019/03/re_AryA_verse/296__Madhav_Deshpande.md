Hello Jan,

     Here is my recording of my verse in Āryā.  This is the general style
of reciting Āryā in Maharashtra.  This meter was made popular in Marathi by
a poet named Moropant [Mayūrakavi] during the Peshwa period.  He composed
108 different Rāmāyaṇas, and an entire Mahābhārata in Marathi using Āryā.
