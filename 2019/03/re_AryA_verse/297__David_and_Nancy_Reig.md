Dear Madhav,

Your recording did not come through. I, too, would be anxious to hear it.

While writing, I have long been wanting to say how much I have benefited
from your verses. It is very rare that we can know for sure what a writing
in Sanskrit means, directly from the author. This is especially so for
metrical verses. Your accompanying English translations are really helpful.
I look forward to my daily Sanskrit lessons from you, in the form of your
lovely verses.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
