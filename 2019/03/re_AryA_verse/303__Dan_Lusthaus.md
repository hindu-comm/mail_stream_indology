I also often have problems receiving attachments in Indology messages. In this case I didn’t even receive the email with the recording. I too would be interested in hearing it. And like others, I second what David wrote. It is fascinating and instructive to see your English translation alongside the Sanskrit for many reasons, including your word choices in both languages.

This meter was made popular in Marathi by a poet named Moropant [Mayūrakavi] during the Peshwa period.  He composed 108 different Rāmāyaṇas, and an entire Mahābhārata in Marathi using Āryā.
