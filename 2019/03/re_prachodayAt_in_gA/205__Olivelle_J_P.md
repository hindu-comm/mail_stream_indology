Dear list members,

What is the verbal category of pracodayāt in gāyatrī mantras . For example :
 ekadantāya vidmahe
vakratuṇḍāya dhīmahi
tan no dantī pracodayāt


Is it a causative subjunctive similar to the example in Whitney's grammar section 1043  dhārayāt
or is it a benedictive/precative?  Is there such a thing as a causative precative?


Thanks,
Harry Spier
