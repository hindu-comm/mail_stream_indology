On the colors and health sciences, particularly significant would be the Chandogya 8.6, with Sankara’s commentary (though he is not terribly convinced himself and somewhere says something like, “it is what I think, for more go and see a doctor”).

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Colour symbolism in pre-modern Indic sources; concise overview of the senses

Dominik: on senses, not a secondary source, but there is a lot of material in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka and the Chāndogya about the competition among the senses that could be informative.

Students are asking me for readings for their essays, and I'm slightly stumped for good suggestions on these two.  Can anyone point to some good studies of these topics?

I am particularly interested in colour readings in relation to the health sciences and alchemy, but anything will do!  I know about Martha Selby's 2005 "Narratives of Conception" article and its remarks on red/white distinctions in ayurveda.

Regarding the senses, I haven't yet checked the Brill encyclopedia, and I will.  Probably there's something in Dasgupta, Hist. Indi. Philosophy.

Any suggestions will be much appreciated.

Best,
Dominik
