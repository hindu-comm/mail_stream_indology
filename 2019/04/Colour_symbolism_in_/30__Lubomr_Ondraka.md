Regarding the senses, I would start with this volume:

Axel Michaels, Christoph Wulf (eds), Exploring the Senses: South Asian and European Perspectives on Rituals and Performativity, Routledge 2014.

I am not aware of any specific study on colours in medicine or alchemy, but a good starting point could be the relevant chapter in Teun Goudriaan's Māyā Divine and Human (MLBD 1978).

Best,
Lubomir
