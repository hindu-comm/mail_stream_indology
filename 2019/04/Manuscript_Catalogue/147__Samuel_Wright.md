Dear List,

Does anyone have either of these catalogues in PDF form? I am not able to
find a copy online and my library does not have them.

*Catalogue of Pali, Sinhalese, & Sanskrit manuscripts in the Ceylon
Government Oriental Library*. Ceylon Government Oriental Library. Columbo:
1876.

*A catalogue of Pali, Sinhalese, and Sanskrit manuscripts in the temple
libraries of Ceylon*. Compiled by Louis de Zoysa. Columbo: 1885.


Many thanks,
Sam
