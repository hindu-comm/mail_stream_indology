Mr.Riegle,On receipt of your reply to my query on Adhyash,I just wrote a thanks-giving reply yesterday.But I suddenly felt I need to write a little bit more on this.Indeed,"Superimposition",is an all-weather comprehensive transliteration of Adhyash.Adhyash , perhaps is the most appropriate logic with which to approach the entire philosophy of Absolute Monism or Adwaitya (in Sanskrit) .How to explain. the omnipresent ONE from amongst the MANY.Why do we fail to get to the ultimate TRUTH?....because a sheath of falsity is superimposed on the TRUTH,thus preventing us from getting to its root.Why can't we break this barrier or remove the sheath of falsity? ...due to our ignorance or nescience. Alakendu Das.

Dear Alakendu Das,
If you had not written 
that "superimposition" is a translation of adhyash, I would not have 
recognized what word you meant by adhyash. It is always helpful to use 
the standard transliteration for Sanskrit words, in this case adhyāsa;
 or if you do not have access to unicode characters, then adhyaasa or 
adhyAsa would work. 

Already in George Thibaut's 1890 translation of The Vedānta-sūtras with the Commentary by Śaṅkarācārya, Part 1, "superimposition" was used for adhyāsa (p. 4, etc.). Swami Gambhirananda, too, in his 1965 translation of Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya of Śrī Śaṅkarācārya





 used "superimposition" for adhyāsa (p. 2, etc.). This seems to be one of those cases where the English translation of a Sanskrit term, "superimposition" for adhyāsa, is so good that everyone adopted it. I have not taken note of other translations of 
adhyāsa.
However, if a simpler translation is wanted, such as for English-as-a-second-language speakers who may not know the word "superimposition," one could use "false attribution," the definition of
adhyāsa

given in Apte's Sanskrit-English dictionary.
Best regards,
David ReigleColorado, U.S.A.

Respected Scholars,
Adhyash happens to be a significant concept in Vedanta philosophy.So far,"Superimposition" is the only word which I came across,as a literal translation of Adhyash in English.Is there any other word ,in the philosophical context,which tantamounts to Adhyash?
