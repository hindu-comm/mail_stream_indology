Dear Nicole,


W. Norman Brown, in his monograph on this text in the HOS, does address this issue in his introduction. He does not think the ascription to Shankara to be plausible, but thinks it may have been written by a later figure within Shankara's tradition, and, like certain other works of perhaps similar origins, subsequently attributed to the founding master.


best,

Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Saundarya Lahari

Hi everyone,

Apologies for the cross-posting on RISA.

I have a student who is interested in studying contemporary debates regarding the attribution of the Saundarya Lahari to Shankara.  I'm sort of at a loss on this one: does anyone know of any articles or book chapters to which I might point him?

Thanks!
Nicole Karapanagiotis
