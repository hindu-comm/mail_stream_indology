Maybe replace in the governing committee

Adheesh Sathaye, University of British Columbia (on leave from 2018/11)
by a female colleague so 6:2 = 3 of each gender, and if possible somebody from India (underrepresented in the committee). I take the opportunity for correcting a previous post in a related matter:

The personal stories narrated by these women inform us the current trend of Sanskrit studies in India. Statistics suggests that more than 60% female students are studying and same no of women are enjoying faculty position in some states like Maharashtra, Kerala, and WestBengal.
