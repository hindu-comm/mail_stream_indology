Dear all,



Greetings from Ashoka University! 

I am primarily a philosopher, but have a background in Indian Studies
(especially Hindi and Sanskrit). 

As I am currently compiling a reading list on Anekāntavāda, I would love to
receive your suggestions. 



Indeed, every suggestion will be very much appreciated – either via the list
(if you think it is of interest to many) or via personal email (see below)!



Thank you and best wishes,

Raja
