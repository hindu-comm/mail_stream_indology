Dear Dominik, 

No words. You are so simple. Indology is in safe hands. I am also with those members who stand for the long lasting life of this list. 

Warm regards,
SV

At the present time and for the foreseeable future I can easily carry it, and I honestly would prefer the simplicity of that approach.  No tax issues, no accounts, no discussions.  It's the lowest-maintenance version of things, and that suits me best.
