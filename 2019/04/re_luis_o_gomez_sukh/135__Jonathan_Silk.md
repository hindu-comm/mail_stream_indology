Dear David
As far as I know--and I tried to find out several times--Luis himself had
no plans to publish whatever he had accomplished, despite my own entreaties
and offers to help. Moreover, while I do not have direct contact with his
widow, it is my understanding that access to the materials he left behind
is not easy.
As far as the smaller sūtra goes, however, I myself will publish something
(let's not get into my promising a date!) which will try to take into
account all available materials, including a reconsideration of the
Sanskrit materials published by Fujita who, however, actually normalized
his texts to a degree that perhaps slightly misrepresents the tradition as
available.
When I have something, I'll let you know.
Best, Jonathan
