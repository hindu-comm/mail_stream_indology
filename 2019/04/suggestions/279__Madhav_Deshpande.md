I am looking for some English language book or article that discusses how
passages from the Bhagavadgītā or Upaniṣads have been subjected to multiple
*padacchedas* and interpretations by different commentators.  I have most
of the Sanskrit commentaries, but I need to provide some reading materials
for a few readers who are interested in this phenomenon, but don't read
Sanskrit commentaries.  Any suggestions?
