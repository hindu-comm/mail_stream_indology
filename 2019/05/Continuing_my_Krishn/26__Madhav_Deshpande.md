Continuing my Krishna verses

समुद्रमन्थने मेरुमुद्धर्तुं मज्जनक्षणे ।
महापृष्ठोऽभवत् कूर्मो धृतरक्षाव्रतो हरि: ।।७२८।।
To lift up the mountain Meru at the moment of drowning during the churning
of the ocean [by gods and demons], Krishna/Vishnu, with the responsibility
to protect the world, became a tortoise with a large back.
