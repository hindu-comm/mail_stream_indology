Professor S.A. Srinivasan (1932-2019)

***************************

FORWARDED MESSAGE

*********************

It is my sad duty as his student to report that on the 2nd of May 2019, 
Professor S.A. Srinivasan, former Professor for Indology at the section 
for Indian Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute of the University of 
Hamburg, passed away after a long illness in Reinbek (Germany).

He was born on 18th september 1932.

He is survived by his wife, Dr. Pia Srinivasan.

Professor S.A. Srinivasan was one of the few persons to teach not only 
Sanskrit but also Tamil, Kannada and Telugu. His dedication and his 
erudition will be sorely missed.
