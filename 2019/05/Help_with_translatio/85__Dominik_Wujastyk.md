Could this be related to the Hathayoga practice of (sarasvatī)cālana that
James Mallinson has rediscovered and written about?  Pp. 258 ff. in

Mallinson, J. (2012) "The Original Gorakaṣaśataka," in:, D. G. White
(ed.), *Yoga
in Practice,* (Princeton University Press), pp. 257–72. Available online
at: https://www.academia.edu/3491519/.

Probably not, in your verse, where the compound seems adjectival.
