Hi,

I am looking for maps of Tibet (1400-2000). I want to create visuals of who
ruled/influenced/in conflict during the reigns of different Dalai Lamas.
For example, Mongol, China, British, etc. I will greatly appreciate if
someone can share some images and or direct me to where I can find the
same.

Thank you,
Sravana
