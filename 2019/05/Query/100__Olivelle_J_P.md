Sorry for bombarding you all with questions. But I came across this citation in a work that I am editing, and I cannot trace it. The only Bhāvaviveka I know of is the well-known Buddhist philosopher, but it is unlikely that my author is referring to him.

वैमनस्यं श्रमो वापि व्यापारे नैव जायते ।
यस्य रागश्च वर्धेत नरोऽसावलसेतर: ॥
इति भावविवेकेऽनलसलक्षणमुक्तम् ।


Thanks.

Patrick
