A scholar who does no belong to this group asked me a question, and I draw a blank. “I amlooking for a Hindu myth about a son's search for his father. Does something come to mind? Telemachus’ search for Odysseus has triggered my quest.”

Any ideas will be deeply appreciated. With thanks and best wishes,
