Dear List Members,

I am currently preparing a short video introduction to Vedic Sanskrit 
for students of linguistics and would like to illustrate the Pathas with 
a picture of an RV manuscript as I think the students would benefit 
greatly from this.

Unfortunately, I can't find a RV manuscript online (labeled for 
noncommercial reuse) in which both the Samhita and Pada Patha are 
combined...

Any help or hints much appreciated!

Thanks,

Tim Felix Aufderheide
