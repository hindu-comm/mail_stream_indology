Dear Colleagues,

     There are discussions on the quotation हरीतकीं भुङ्क्ष्व राजन् मातेव
हितकारिणीम् in commentaries on the Siddhānta Kaumudī.  Looks like a quote
from a work on Āyurveda.  None of the Āyurveda texts that I have has a
verse index.  I am wondering if anyone came across this line in a known
text.  Grammarians like Nāgeśabhaṭṭa have argued that the use of nominative
in मातेव in this verse is ungrammatical.  मातेव हितकारिणी occurs in several
other places, but this is the only quote that has मातेव हितकारिणीम्.  I
will appreciate any help in tracing this quotation.  Best,
