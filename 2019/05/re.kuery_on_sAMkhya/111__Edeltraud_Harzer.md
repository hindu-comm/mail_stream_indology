> Given that the Sankhya theory of creation is not understood in terms of physics, rather in psychological/ spiritual(?) terms. It seems to stand to reason that creation will not start from a source that is a mere vehicle for the ultimate freedom. What may seem much more odd is that the ultimate freedom depends on the experience of being able to discriminate or isolate unintentional consciousness (पुरुष:) from materiality (प्रकृति:). This discrimination has to be embodied, hence the auxiliary “material/ gross” body.

This seems a very odd evolutionary path when we first encounter it and I am wondering if there has been any work that seeks to explain just why Sāṃkhya adopted what to us may seem a remarkably counter-intuitive framework. I do have my own theory about this, but I would not want to publish it if someone else has already come up with a similar idea. I would therefore be grateful for any suggestions you may have concerning scholarship that seeks to explain just why it is that Sāṃkhyaproceeds from top to bottom, as it were, rather than the other way around.
