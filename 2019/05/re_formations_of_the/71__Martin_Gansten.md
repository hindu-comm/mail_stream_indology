Many thanks to Stefan Baums for the additional examples phalāphala and 
bhavābhava. I find it interesting that so many (all?) of these 
reduplications with -ā- /not/ derived from a verb root seem to come from 
Buddhist texts. Does this suggest a MIA origin of this feature?

This is not my area, but would something like 'justifying the unjust' be 
possible?

Best wishes,
Martin
