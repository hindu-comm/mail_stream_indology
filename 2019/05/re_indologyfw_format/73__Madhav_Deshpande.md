There is an interesting example *madāmadam* in the Kaṭha-Upaniṣad:

आसीनो दूरं व्रजति शयानो याति सर्वतः । कस्तं मदामदं देवं मदन्यो ज्ञातुमर्हति
।। 1.2.21 ।।

However, Śaṅkara interprets it as *mada+amada*: एवमसावात्मा देवो मदामदः
समदोऽमदश्च सहर्षोऽहर्षश्च विरुद्धधर्मवानतोऽशक्यत्वाज्ज्ञातुं कः तं मदामदं
देवं मदन्यो ज्ञातुमर्हति।
