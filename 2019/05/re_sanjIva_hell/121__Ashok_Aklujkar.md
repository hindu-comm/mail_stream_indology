Dear Dr. Koch,

You are more likely to find paintings of hells or hell dwellers in the Jain collections of manuscripts. In the catalogues of such collections I have found them referred to with the Gujarati title nārakino / nārakīno citra. Please see the catalogues of collections at Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Indological research Institute (Ahmedabad) and Jain Ātmānanda Sabhā (Bhavnagar). Some collections may be found also in Mumbai.
