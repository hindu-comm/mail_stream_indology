database:

Zitat von Jonathan Silk via INDOLOGY <indology at list.indology.info>:

> Dear Friends,

> Might anyone be aware of observations about the influence of shadows in
> Classical India? There is a passage in a Buddhist text that speaks of the
> positive influence of a dhāraṇī text which is so great that, when it is
> held aloft, if one were to merely pass through its shadow... So I know that
> this is hyperbolic, but it set me wondering if there are other references
> to the effect of shadows...
> thanks!
