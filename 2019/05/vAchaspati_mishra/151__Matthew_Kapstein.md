Dear friends,


I seem to recall from my student days that Vācaspati Miśra was often treated as two: Vācaspati Miśra I and Vācaspati Miśra II.


However, it now seems that this doubling has disappeared and he is mostly treated as a single figure.


Can you refer me to any work that explicitly discusses and resolves the issue?


with thanks in advance,

Matthew
