Although I have no intention to attend it: thanks for sending us this
timely information that it is taking place and an open call for papers.
I am also happy to see critical remarks and *brief* discussions on possible
problems in the organization and motivation of this and other indological
events, but hope that this List will remain a place where scholars,
regardless of their political, philosophical, ethical ... orientation, will
continue to feel welcome to announce their conferences and "conferences".
Best regards,
Jan Houben
