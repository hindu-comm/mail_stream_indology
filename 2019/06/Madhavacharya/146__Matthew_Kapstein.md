In fact, the late Anantalal Thakur demonstrated that the SDS was NOT written by माधवाचार्यः but by his protege, the logician Cannibhaṭṭa.

He provides his evidence, which is entirely convincing, here:
Anantalal Thakur, “Cannibhaṭṭa and the authorship of the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha,” Bulletin of the Adyar Library 25
(1961): 524–538.

It is odd that few seem to have taken note of Thakur's impressive detective work and that most still attribute the SDS to माधवा.


best regards,

Matthew

No, Purnaprajna Darsana is founded by Madhvacarya श्रीमध्वाचार्याः
And the author of Sarvadarsana sangraha is Madhavacharya
माधवाचार्यः
