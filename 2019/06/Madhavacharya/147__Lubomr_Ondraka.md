A nuanced discussion of the problem of the authorship of the SDS (which includes the evaluation of Thakur's arguments) is available in Jon Yamashita's thesis: A Translation and Study of the Pāṇinidarśana Chapter of the Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha (1998), pp. 22–32. It is partly inconclusive:

In conclusion, both internal and external evidence suggests that the author of the Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha was not Mādhavācārya, the elder brother of Sāyaṇa. Rather, the author must have been at least a generation later than Mādhavācārya. Two possible candidates which have been proposed are [1] the son of Sāyaṇa — whose name Māyaṇa is to be considered a corruption or regional form of "Mādhava", and [2] Cannibhaṭṭa, the naiyāyika author of the Tarkabhāṣāprakāśikā – either independently or as part of a committee. There is no direct proof to support either choice; the available evidence, however, allows each to be given serious consideration as possible candidates for the authorship. At most, we can say with certainty that under either claim, the Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha would have been composed during the fourteenth century under the patronage of the Vijayanagara court. (p. 31)

Best,
Lubomir
