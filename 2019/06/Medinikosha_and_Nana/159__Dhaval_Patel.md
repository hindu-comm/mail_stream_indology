Dear scholars,
Would anyone of you kindly guide me to a decent quality scans of the
following works please -
1. Nānārthārṇavasaṅkṣepa of Keśavasvāmin
2. Nānārthaśabdakoṣa of Medinikara.

I have scans probably gathered from archive.org which are not legible.
Visarga, anusvāra etc are not visible at places.
