*About the book*

This book is a study of the five shorter works of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār, an 
eighth-century Tamil poet who had retired from a military career in 
South India to pursue his interest in literature. For each work, the 
book provides the original Tamil in metric feet, transliteration 
indicating word boundaries, and an English translation as true to the 
original Tamil as possible, with numerous notations on grammar and 
textual highlights. The introduction treats the poet’s interest in 
developing his literary skills by emulating a variety of poetic devices, 
techniques, structures, and strategies of earlier Tamil texts. The 
material covers developments in Tamil prosody, a unique poetic scheme, 
and adaptation of several Tamil literary motifs. The book also includes 
an analytical glossary, as well as appendices highlighting the status of 
some Middle Tamil grammatical forms. The first appendix provides 
uninterrupted translations of the five works in an English style that 
attempts to approach the voice and tenor of the Āḻvār, while an appendix 
on prosody discusses a previously undocumented adaptation of a Tamil 
metrical unit.
