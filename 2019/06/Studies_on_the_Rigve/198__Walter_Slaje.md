Dear George,

by using the link I had previously sent
https://uvhw.de/studia-indologica/product/190225_08-193-9.html
an add-to-cart button ("In den Warenkorb") will show, bottom left. A click
adds the ordered copy to the cart. As a next step, go to "Warenkorb" proper
(displayed in white letters in the black bar above):
https://uvhw.de/warenkorb.html
The rest will be self-explanatory, I believe.

The same ordering process holds good for all the volumes in this series:
https://uvhw.de/studia-indologica.html

Optionally, one can always also send a simple order mail to the publishers:
bestellung at uvhw.de
peter.junkermann at uvhw.de

Hope, it helps!
Best wishes,
Walter
