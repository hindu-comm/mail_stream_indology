Dear Joanna,

"To be ignored is even worse than to be criticized." Hear, hear!
Already an admirer of your work, I now start liking you even better.
Count me in for your "fierce discussion with fruitful conclusions
which will open new perspectives in our research. No exclusive, but
inclusive."

So long,

Koenraad ELST

I know very well that my work is simply ignored by some scholar (for the moment I will not reveal their names, although some of you probably know them). To be ignored is even worse than to be criticized.

We, Poles, are good in organizing round-tables debates, the fall of communism in the Eastern Europe began with such a debate 30 years ago.

My mother tongue is Polish and, although I have made a lot of effort to learn English as well as I could,  my thoughts and feelings are expressed in Polish in the best way. Unfortunately, it is me who has to learn foreign language to be internationally recognized, and not many of you (if you are German or French, you can also present  your research in your languages) . But the fact that your languages are in use  is the matter of chance or power. It has nothing to do with quality of my research.
