Dear colleagues,

When these discussions arise that have a political dimension, and you feel
moved to write to one of the good guys with a message of support, please
think about sending it publicly.  Messages of support are a very good
thing, public or private.  Anything is better than nothing.  But sending
such a message publicly can greatly magnify the effectiveness of the
support for the individual.  It also sends a message to everyone, on this
list and beyond, that there is a ground-swell of kindness, of human
fellow-feeling, positivity and watchfulness amongst the majority of our
community.  We care about each other and will support each other when
attacked.

Best wishes,
Dominik
