Dear colleagues,

The EFEO is soliciting applications for three doctoral positions in Southeast Asian epigraphy and history: one for Cambodia, one for CampƒÅ and one for Java. In all cases, knowledge of Sanskrit is a great plus.

The French announcement is available here: <https://www.efeo.fr/uploads/docs/pdf_presentation/PhD-Candidates-DHARMA-EFEO_FR.pdf>. I am attaching the English equivalent.

Please forward to colleagues in the relevant fields, and to any potentially interested students.

Thank you.

Arlo Griffiths
