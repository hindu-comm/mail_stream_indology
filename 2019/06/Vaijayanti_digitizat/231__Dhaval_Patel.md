Dear scholars,

Kindly find attached the famous Sanskrit lexicon Vaijayanti (वैजयन्ती) by
Yadavaprakasha (यादवप्रकाश) digitized.
https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/vaijayanti_yadavaprakasha/orig/vaijayanti.txt

Annotation and further processing is pending. Will take quite some time to
complete that exercise.

Any suggestions or corrections are welcome.
