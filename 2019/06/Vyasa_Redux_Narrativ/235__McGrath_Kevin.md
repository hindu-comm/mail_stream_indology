  Dear Colleagues,


I would like to announce the release of a new book, 'Vyasa Redux, Narrative in Epic Mahabharata', published by Anthem Press in London.


This follows in the concepts and methods developed by my previous works that interpret the epic poem; some of these titles are listed below.


With best wishes, from,


   Kevin McGrath.
