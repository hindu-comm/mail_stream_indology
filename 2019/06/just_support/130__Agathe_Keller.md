Dear Tyler, patricia and antonia,

just an off list message of support and warmth as the level of insults gets worse at every posting

twenty years back already the original indology list had came down precisely by a simillar kind of attack in which Konrad Elst was  already involved…

it shows how right you are to hold you’re ground and how in danger a certain kind of gentle academia is, alas

best

Agathe
