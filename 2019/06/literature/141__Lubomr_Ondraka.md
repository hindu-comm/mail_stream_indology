Dear Victor,

this an extremely vast subject, but a good starting point could be:
N. N. Bhattacharyya, History of Indian Cosmogonical Ideas. Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1971.
It is useful in collecting references to primary texts and presenting a good number of various cosmogony models, but less satisfactory in their interpretation.

A collection of Kuiper’s essays (F. B. J. Kuiper, Ancient Indian cosmogony, ed. John Irwin, New Delhi: Vikas Publ. House, 1983) is very good, but deals mainly with Vedic material. 

Specifically for purāṇic cosmogony see:
Madeleine Biardeau,  Études de mythologie hindoue (III). I. Cosmogonies purâniques (suite),  Bulletin de l'École française d'Extrême-Orient Année 58 (1971): 17-89.

There are plenty of more special studies, most of them are listed here:

But as far as I know, they do not "trace literary motifs in cosmogonic myths diachronically".

Best,
Lubomir
