Dear members of the list,

I wonder if any of you could share with me a soft copy of Mahādeva’s Nyāyakaustubha for the part of the text after the Pratyakṣakhaṇḍa (several versions of the latter are located on archive.org). In particular, I am looking for the Śabdakhaṇḍa (presumably, the final chapter of the text).
Many thanks in advance!

best,
Andrey
