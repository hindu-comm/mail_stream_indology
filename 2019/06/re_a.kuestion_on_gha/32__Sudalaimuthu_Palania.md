Subject: [INDOLOGY] A question on ghaṭikās



Dear Scholars,





I remember  reading a discussion about how examinations were conducted in a typical ghaṭikā. Each question was written on a palm leaf and many such palm leaves were put inside a pot. When a student came to be tested, a palm leaf was pulled from the pot and the student was asked the question written on the palm leaf. 



Unfortunately, I have lost the reference to this discussion. Does anybody on the list know the source?



Thank you in advance.



Regards,

Palaniappan
