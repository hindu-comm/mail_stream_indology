Here is a good quality scan of Thibaut's article on the Sūryaprajñapti that
was referred to:

http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Jaina%20Texts/suryaprajnapti,_on_the,_1880_thibaut.pdf

I have also scanned and posted primary sources on the Sūryaprajñapti. These
are not easy to find, so I list them here:

Śrīsūryaprajñaptyupāṅgam with commentary by Malayagiri, 1919:
