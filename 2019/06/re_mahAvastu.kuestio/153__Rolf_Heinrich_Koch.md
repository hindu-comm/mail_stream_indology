Dear Valerie,

the GRETIL-text of Senart's edition is here:

http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/buddh/mhvastuu.htm

This text (consisting of three great chapters) Jones translated in three 
volumes. In volume 1 you'll find the numbers of the chapters 1.1-1.366 
(of Senart's edition). Jones mentions only the secondary numbers 1-366. 
The same in vol. 2 and 3.

Best

Heiner
