Dear Valerie,

Might I suggest you read the following:

Tournier, Vincent. 2012. “The Mahāvastu and the Vinayapiṭaka of the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravādin.” Annual Report of the International Research Institute for Advanced Buddhology at Soka University for the Academic Year 2011 15: 87–104.
———. 2017. La formation du Mahāvastu et la mise en place des conceptions relatives à la carrière du bodhisattva. Monographies 195. Paris: École française d’Extrême-Orient.

You will learn among many other things that Mahāvastu-Avadāna is not a correct designation of the text.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mahāvastu questions

Dear Colleagues

(1) Does anyone know where there is a searchable Sanskrit text of the Mahāvastu Avadāna online? The one formerly at http://fiindolo.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/4_rellit/buddh/mhvastuu.htm seems to have disappeared.

(2) Similarly with a searchable translation? The versions I’ve found of the J J Jones one are frustrating to use: see (3).

(3) Does anyone understand the verse and chapter numbering of this text? The text references and translation seem to use a completely different system.

(4) Has anyone got Basak’s text to hand? If so, I would be grateful to see copies of a couple of pages.

Many thanks -

Valerie J Roebuck
Manchester, UK
