The optative, bhavet, syƒÅt, etc. should often be translated in modern
English in an indicative sense.  Is there some formal grammatical
documentation for this somewhere?

Related, modern speakers of Indian English often use an
optative/subjunctive/conditional "would" where a native British speaker
would use a more direct indicative "is".

Best,
Dominik
