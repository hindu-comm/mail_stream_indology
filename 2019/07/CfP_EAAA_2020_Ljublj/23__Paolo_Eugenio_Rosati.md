Dear all,

I attached a CfP for the next conference of the *European Association for
the Study of Asian Art and Archaeology.*

Please if you are interested in participating, email me as soon as possible
because the deadline of the Panel Proposal is 15th August.

*Panel title:* *Tantric, Folk, and Tribal Goddesses in the Art of South
Asia: Intersection, Transformation, and Fusion of Mainstream and 'Marginal'
Traditions*.

Sincerely,
Paolo
