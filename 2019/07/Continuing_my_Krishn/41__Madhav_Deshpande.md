Continuing my Krishna verses
(Honoring the Gurus)

पूर्वेषामपि स गुरु: कृष्ण: पार्थोपदेशकृत् ।
स कालेनानवच्छेदाद्गुरूणां परमो गुरु: ।।
[Cf. Yogasūtra: स पूर्वेषामपि गुरु: कालेनानवच्छेदात्]

Krishna, the advisor of Arjuna, is the teacher of even the previous
teachers. Since he has no limitation of time, he is the ultimate teacher of
teachers.
