With apologies for cross-posting, I would like to bring to your attention a new edited volume on the householder in ancient India: Gṛhastha: The Householder in Ancient Indian Religious Culture, OUP, 2019. The volume argues that the term gṛhastha, the most common word for householder in later Sanskrit literature, is a neologism first encountered in the Aśokan inscriptions and absent in the entire Vedic corpus. It investigates the use of the term in a spectrum of ancient Indian literary genres and how this new discovery affects our knowledge of ancient Indian religions.
