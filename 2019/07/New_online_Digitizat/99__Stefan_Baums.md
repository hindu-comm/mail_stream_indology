Dear Jonathan,

many thanks indeed to you and the Libary of Congress for making
this important manuscript more widely available to scholarship! I
linked to your digitization from the entry for this manuscript in
the Catalog of Gāndhārī Texts:

which contains some metadata and a list of publications on this
manuscript so far.

All best wishes,
Stefan
