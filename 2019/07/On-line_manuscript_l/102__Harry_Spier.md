Dear list members,
In case this might be new to some members (it was to me), searching for a
sanskrit phrase on-line I came across this on-line library of indian
manuscript images of the Lalchand Research Library of the DAV college.
http://www.dav.splrarebooks.com/

Some of them have transliterations and translations along with the
manuscript photographs. I don't know how common this is in the collection.
Looking at the Indology archives it looks like there was some mention of
this project about 2000.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
