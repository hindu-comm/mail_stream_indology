I am pleased to announce the publication of the 26th J. Gonda Lecture that
I delivered in 2018:  "From Pāṇini to Patañjali and Beyond - Development of
Religious Motifs in Sanskrit Grammar."

The pdf of this publication is available on the following website:
www.knaw.nl

I have not tried downloading it, but this is what the published version
says.  Let me know if there are any issues with downloading.

With best regards,

Madhav M. Deshpande
Professor Emeritus, Sanskrit and Linguistics

Senior Fellow, Oxford Center for Hindu Studies

[Residence: Campbell, California, USA]
