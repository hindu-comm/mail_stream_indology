 Sadly, I have to agree. Thank you.

 I have to say that this must cross some kind of line of accepted behavior on this list.

  I support the expression of a wide range of opinions, even if I don't agree with them. But even if I agreed with you, I would take exception at this kind of language and the vitriol. 
  From a practical perspective, it also vitiates any point you might be trying to make.
