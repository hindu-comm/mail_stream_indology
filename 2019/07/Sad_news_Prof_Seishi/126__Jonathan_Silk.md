Dear Friends,
Since apparently the news has not yet reached this forum, I take the
opportunity to share with you my grief at the sudden and entirely
unexpected passing of an outstanding scholar and dear friend, Seishi
Karashima, who died in his sleep yesterday. He was only 62. His work in
particular on Buddhist Middle Indic is no doubt known to many of you.

In grief,

Jonathan Silk
