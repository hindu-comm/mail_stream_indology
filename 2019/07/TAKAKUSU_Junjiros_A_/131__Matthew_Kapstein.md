Dear colleagues,

Does anyone have a scanned copy available of the original 1900 print
of TAKAKUSU Junjirō's "A Pail Chrestomathy with Notes and Glossary
Giving Sanskrit and Chinese Equivalents" published in 1900 by Kinkodo
& Co?

I picked up a reprint in Japan a while ago but it seems like the
reprints from 1908(?) onwards removed the 94 page English preface!

If someone has a nice scan I would be happy to upload it to Archive.org<http://Archive.org> :)

Kind regards,
Antonio Ferreira-Jardim
