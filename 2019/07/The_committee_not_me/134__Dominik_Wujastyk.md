Dear everyone,

When querying matters relating to the management of the INDOLOGY forum
please, *please* write to the committee,

   - indology-owner <indology-owner at list.indology.info>  (also given on the
   main INDOLOGY.info website)

not to me or the other committee members individually.  We take turns being
on duty, and this is not my week; I finished on Sunday.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
