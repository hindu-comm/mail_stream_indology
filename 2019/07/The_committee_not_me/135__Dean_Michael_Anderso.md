 Sorry, I just hit the reply all button. I will be more discriminating next time (I hope).

>this is not my week; I finished on Sunday.
Just in time. Congratulations. :-)
And thanks.

 Dear everyone, 

When querying matters relating to the management of the INDOLOGY forum please, please write to the committee, 

   - indology-owner <indology-owner at list.indology.info> (also given on the main INDOLOGY.info website)
not to me or the other committee members individually. We take turns being on duty, and this is not my week; I finished on Sunday.
Best,Dominik Wujastyk
