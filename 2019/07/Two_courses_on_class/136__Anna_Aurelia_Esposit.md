Dear Colleagues,
we invite applications for two intensive courses on Kannada, both  
conducted by Prof. B.A. Viveka Rai at the Chair of Indology, Würzburg  
University:

"Kannada as a Classical Language",
May 4th until 8th 2020
This course focusses on the classical literary genre Champu. After an  
introduction into classical Kannada, Janna’s Yashodhara Charite  
(chapters 3 and 4) will be read and studied. Participants are expected  
to possess knowledge of fundamental grammar and the Kannada script  
before attending the course.

"Modern Kannada – Beginner's level",
May 11th until 22nd 2020
The course provides an introduction to the Kannada language through an  
extensive program combining spoken Kannada with reading, writing and  
grammar skills. It is intended for students of various disciplines and  
without any previous knowledge in Kannada.

Prof. Dr. B.A. Viveka Rai is a retired professor of Kannada Literature  
and Folklore at the University of Mangalore. Since 2010, he is a  
regular guest professor at the Chair of Indology, University of  
Würzburg, teaching Kannada and classical Kannada, as well as courses  
on the culture and literature of Karnataka.

The fee is 150 Euro (Classical Kannada) and 300 Euro (Modern Kannada)  
respectively (including teaching materials). A reduction for students  
and unemployed is possible upon request. For any questions and for  
registration please write to Anna Aurelia Esposito

We would be grateful if you could widely circulate this call for applications.

Best regards,
Anna Aurelia Esposito
