Dear Friends,

I am looking for an up to date index of sites/projects that have digitized Sanskrit literature and/or metadata of Sanskrit literature.

I am aware of the lists<http://indology.info/etexts/> maintained on the Indology site and its links<http://indology.info/links/> page.

Thank you kindly,

Martin Gluckman
