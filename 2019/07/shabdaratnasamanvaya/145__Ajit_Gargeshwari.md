When one says pages are missing from a book at archive.org, please give a
complete downloadable link for the book so that corrected books with notes
can be uploaded.  Archives, might have multiple copies of a given book
uploaded by different users. I had downloaded the book several years ago
from archives.org and there are no missing pages in the pdf I had
downloaded. You can download the requested pages from this link.
