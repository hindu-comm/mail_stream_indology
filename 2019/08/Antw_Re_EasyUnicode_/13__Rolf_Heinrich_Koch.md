For windows and roman letters:

As far as I my expierence goes: Using only (not combined) 
UNICODE-letters there are no problems for indexing all your files. The 
UNICODE-fonts include all diacritical signs within 1 letter (e.g. ś) 
for studies on classical indological texts (vedic accents - I do not know).
Whenever I built up letters with diacritical marks (combining two 
UNICODE signs e.g. s + ´) the indexing process did not work properly.

Indexing all your files is important for any search beyond searching in 
one file only.

Heiner
