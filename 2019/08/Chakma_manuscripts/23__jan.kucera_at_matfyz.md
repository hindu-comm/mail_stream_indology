Dear all,

I am looking for any pre-1900 resources written in the Chakma script. I have accidentally discovered that the library in Munich holds a few Chakma manuscripts, so I was wondering if anyone might have any experience or tips on what other archives or collections might be worth contacting.

Thank you and best regards,
Jan Kuƒçera
