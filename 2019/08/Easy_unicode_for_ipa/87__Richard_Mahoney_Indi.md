Dear Malcolm,

This is curious. I don't use a Mac, and Windows only for a few things,
mostly
Adobe CS6 &c. Windows 10 runs in an instance of Oracle's VirtualBox
and I
connect to it using an ancient IBM PS2 keyboard --the really loud
clicky type--
made, just checked on the back, in June 1990. The keyboard connects
directly
to the laptop through some sort of hardware USB emulator. Still, given
all this,
the Windows version of Keyman runs just fine, no issues at all. Would
the
ordinary Mac version of Keyman install on your iPad? Would that work
with
your keyboard? From my experience, it really is a good, reliable
application.


Best, Richard

Dear Richard,
Keyman is very useful, thank you for sharing that. The only limitation
I can see (which Keyman confirmed when I asked them) is that on iOS,
they don't have access to hardware keyboards when it's running as a
system keyboard.

That means that if you want to use your iPad for sustained
composition, in place of a laptop, you are restricted to the on-screen 
keyboard if you use Keyman.

So I think there's still no way to robustly integrate diacritics with
a bluetooth keyboard on iPad. But I'm happy to learn that I'm wrong.

Best,
Malcolm
