Dear list members,

Would any members know if there are any writings  relating rasas to music.
Ideally what I'm looking for are statements relating individual musical
ragas to particular rasas.  Such as:
"Raga X manifests rasa Y".

I'm interested in any writings up to and including modern times.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
