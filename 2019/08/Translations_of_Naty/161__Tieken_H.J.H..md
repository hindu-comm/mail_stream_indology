The Nāṭyaśāstra ascribed to Bharata-muni. Vols. I (Chapters I-XXVII). Edited with an Introduction and Various Readings. By Manomohan Ghosh. Calcutta: Manisha Granthalaya, 1967. As far as (complete) editions is concerned there is the one from the Oriental Institute, Baroda.

Translation:
The Nāṭyaśāstra. A Treatise on Ancient Indian Dramaturgy and Histrionics ascribed to Bharata-muni. Vol. I (Chapters I-XXVII)
Completely translated for the first time from the original Sanskrit with an Introduction, Various Notes and Index. By Manomohan Ghosh. Revised Second Edition. Calcutta: Manisha Granthalaya 1967 (first edition 1951)

Vol. II (Chapters XXVIII–XXXVI). By Manohan Ghosh. Calcutta: The Asiatic Society, 1961

This is what I have. There is also a translation by N.P. Unni, but I haven't seen it.
