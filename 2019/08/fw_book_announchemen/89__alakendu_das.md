Subject: [INDOLOGY] Book announcement: The History of the Arthaśāstra









Dear Colleagues,

I am pleased to announce the publication of my new book on the compositional history of theArthaśāstraand its philosophy of governance:

Mark McClish.The History of the Arthaśāstra: Sovereignty and Sacred Law in Ancient India(Cambridge University Press, 2019), 306 pages.

https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/history-of-the-arthasastra/051E3A722C5339D78EC9B57897827BCD#fndtn-information

Summary:
The first half of the book presents a model of theArthaśāstra’s textual development, arguing that the extant text is a 3rd century CE redaction of a treatise written
 a few centuries earlier. This model is then used in the second half to demonstrate that the political theologies ofvarṇadharmaandrājadharmaexerted little influence on the original text, which was decidedly empiricist and pragmatic in character.
 I argue that this disposition characterized the early statecraft tradition generally.

Table of Contents:
1. Introduction
2.ArthaśāstraHistoriography
3. The Resegmentation of theArthaśāstra
4. Citation and Attribution
5. The Deep Structure of the Text
6. The History of theArthaśāstra
7. The Politics of theDaṇḍanīti
8.Varṇadharmain theArthaśāstra
9.Statecraft, Law, and Religion in Ancient India

All best,
Mark
