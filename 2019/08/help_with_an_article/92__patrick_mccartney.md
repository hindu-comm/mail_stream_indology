Dear Friends, might anyone know if this talk is published in some other
format?

Importance.” In *Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental
Conference: 21st Session, Srinagar.* Vol. 1. Edited by V. Raghavan. Pune:
BORI.

Kulkarni gave a talk at the All-India Oriental Conference  in 1961. The
only mention of this presentation is in the ToC of the proceedings; which
only list the presenters and the title of their talks.

Regrettably, pp 341-352 only give a general overview of this particular panel.

Please let me know if you have any idea where/if this presentation was
