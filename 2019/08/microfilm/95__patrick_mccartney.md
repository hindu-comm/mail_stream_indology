Dear Friends,

I am trying to track down a copy of this book, which is only, it seems,
available on microfilm in the USA.

*Sapre, Lakshamaṇa Nārāyaṇa. 1922. Mallakhāmba. Puṇẽ: Śaṅkara Nārāyaṇa
Jośī *

http://catalog.crl.edu/search~S35?/c90%2F61211+%28G%29/c90+61211+g/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&FF=c90+61211+g&1%2C1%2C#extraBibAnchor

I've never done anything with microfilm before, so I'm a bit confused by
the process of the interlibrary thing as well. But, before I commit to
spending $1.30 per page (172pp), I'm wondering if anyone might already have
this as a pdf?

Thanks.

All the best,

パトリック マッカートニー
