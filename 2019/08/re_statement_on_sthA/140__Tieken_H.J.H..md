Dear Harry, I do not have the books at hand. However, you might have a look at an article of mine, titled "On the Use of Rasa in Studies of Sanskrit Drama" IIJ 43/2 (2000), pp. 115-138. In this article I show, among other things, that in the Natyasastra the distinction between bhavas and sthayibhavas is less stable than is often assumed. You may find a pdf of the article on my website.

Onderwerp: [INDOLOGY] Statement on sthāyibhāva

Dear list members,

On page 23 of Aesthetic Rapture by Masson and Patwardhan , their work on chapter 6 of Nāṭyaśāstra by Bharata is given a definition of sthāyibhāva .
"Now the sthāyibhāva is a state of mind which because it is more deeply felt, dominates all other emotions.  It belongs to both the character and to the spectator".

But the authors don't give a textual reference for this statement.  Can anyone give me a textual reference that supports the part of the definition: ". . . It belongs to both the character and to the spectator".

Thanks,
Harry Spier
