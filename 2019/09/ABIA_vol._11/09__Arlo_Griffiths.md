Dear colleagues,

I find only a few volumes of the Annual Bibliography of Indian Art and Archaeology (ABIA) freely available online (at archive.org). None of the HathiTrust volumes are accessible.

I am in need of volume 11, I believe (but am not sure) for year 1938.

If anyone would be able to share this volume (and perhaps any other not yet findable online), I'd be very grateful.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
