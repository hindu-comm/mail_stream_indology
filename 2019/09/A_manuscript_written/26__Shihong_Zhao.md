Dear Mr. Ruiz-Falqués,

Thank you for your immediate reply. I do not have knowledge of Old Burmese
script. At first, I thought the manuscript is written in Burmese or Thai
script.

As for the date of the manuscript, I actually have no idea. What I know
about it is that my professor found in Lhasa some large volumes of books in
which there are many photographs of South Asian manuscripts. These books
belong to a big project of an official committee in Lhasa which aims at
preserving palm-leaf manuscripts in Tibet. The appearance of this
manuscript in Tibet means that it was purchased and then brought to a
monastery in Tibet in ancient time.

Best wishes,
Zhao
