Dear Friends,

In the following verse of the *Tantrāloka* (28.42cd-43ab) of Abhinavagupta,
I do not completely understand the expression *bha-graha*. The only thing I
am sure is that this has to do with Jyotiṣa.

*bhagraha*samayaviśeṣo nāśvayuje ko 'pi tena tadvarjam |
velā*bhagraha*kalanā kathitaikādaśasu māseṣu ||

Can someone guide me? I apologise for being illiterate in Jyotiṣa and I did
not get much help from the obvious basic sources either. I hope I am not
missing something very basic.

Thanks very much in advance.

Mrinal
