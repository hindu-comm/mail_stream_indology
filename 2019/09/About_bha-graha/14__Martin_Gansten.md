Well, bha = nakṣatra typically means the asterism (out of the 27, 
beginning with Aśvinī or, in the older system, with Kṛttikā) occupied by 
the moon, unless otherwise specified. This is normal usage in muhūrta 
texts too. I am less certain about what to do with the graha part. I had 
a look at Bṛhatsaṃhitā 4.4 (pratidivasam evam arkāt...) but am not sure 
how it would apply to the discussion in the present verses.

The overall concern seems to be the same as in muhūrta generally, that 
is: (1) within each of the different calendric/astronomical variables 
such as tithi, yoga, day of the week, lunar nakṣatra, etc., which are 
most suitable for action X? and (2) when it is not possible to find a 
time that matches all or most these criteria, which one(s) should be 
prioritized? But graha is not a calendric element, and I am not sure 
what precisely it means here.

Best wishes,
Martin
