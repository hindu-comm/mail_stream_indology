Dear Oliver,

At Madhav’s suggestion I am adding two old papers of mine in which I address the issue (within broader contexts); see attached. (For one of the papers I include the original, since the published version is full of typos and, based on an old paper copy, not in the best of visual shapes). 

With all best wishes,

Hans Henrich
