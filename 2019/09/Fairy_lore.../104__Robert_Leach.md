Dear colleagues,

I'd be extremely grateful if anyone could provide me with a soft copy of
the following article (the journal edition appears not to be available
online):

Ram Prasad Bhatt, Heinz Werner Wessler & Claus Peter Zoller (2014) "Fairy
lore in the high mountains of South Asia and the hymn of the Garhwali fairy
'Daughter of the Hills'", *Acta Orientalia *75: 79-166.

Many thanks in advance to anyone who can help!

Robert
