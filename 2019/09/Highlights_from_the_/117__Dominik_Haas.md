Dear Martin, 

just some thoughts from "outside" the box: 

depending on the character of your list, you could also consider
including compiled works or works that have no single author (you
mentioned the Suśruta-Saṃhitā), such as the Mahābhārata or Rāmāyaṇa, or
even Vedic works, such as the Ṛgveda-Saṃhitā - if not because of their
(often outstanding) contents, then because of the extraordinary
achievement of their creators in putting them together. 

If it's about significance or popularity, you could also consider much
shorter texts - for instance, verses or mantras - such as the Mahāvākyas
or the Gāyatrī mantra, the latter (as far as I know) being the first
text ever to become a deity itself. But maybe they belong in a category
of their own; admittedly, I wouldn't submit them for the
Sanskrit-Pulitzer. 

Lastly, modern Sanskrit works (single-authored, book-length) could also
be considered, but unfortunately I cannot give any justified
recommendations here. 

Best wishes, 
Dominik
