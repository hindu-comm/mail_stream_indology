May I put in a word for the Saundaryalaharī, traditionally attributed to Śaṅkara, though probably later than his time? It’s a lovely poem, and also an important document for the development of Śākta devotion and Tantra. W. Norman Brown’s edition and translation, which includes manuscript illustrations, is a treasure in itself.
