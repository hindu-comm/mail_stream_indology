Dear list-members,

A colleague is developing a research project on Out-of-body experiences 
in religious contexts at the turn of the common era and would be 
interested in comparing her material (her focus is on the Mediterranean 
world) with that of other regions.

I have mentioned Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga and the Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 
(though I understand this is a later source) but I would be very 
grateful to anyone who could suggest additional or more pertinent 
sources.

Thank you very much in advance for any help you can provide!

All best,
Jessie Pons
