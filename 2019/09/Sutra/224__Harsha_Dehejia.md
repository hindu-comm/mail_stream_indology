Friends:

I remember vaguely to have heard the phrase "sutrasya sutraha" which I understood to mean a thread within a thread, or a sutra within a thread.
Is this phrase  from the Veda or Vedanta?
Is there any reference to sutra understood as a thread carrying feelings or emotions?

Regards,

Harsha
