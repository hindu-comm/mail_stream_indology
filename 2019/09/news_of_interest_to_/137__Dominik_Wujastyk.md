This has been all over Facebook today (and probably Twitter, though I don't
tweet).  It is deeply regrettable.  In the Scroll.in report that you cite,
Matthew, Romila's own comment is characteristically understated and
non-inflammatory:

“It is a very unfortunate thing,” Thapar told Anandabazar. “We are going
through a strange time.
Emeritus is not a mere designation. It is an honour related to the
university’s goodwill.”

Thank you for sharing.
Best,
Dominik
