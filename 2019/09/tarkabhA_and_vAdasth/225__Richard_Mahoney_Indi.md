Dear Matthew,

Here are the details:

Tarkabhāṣa and Vādasthāna of Mokṣākaragupta and Jitāripāda / edited by
H.R. Rangaswami Iyengar ; with a foreword by Vidhuśekhara Bhattācharya
(Mysore : Printed at the Hindusthan Press, 1952)

And more if you click on "Full record" here:

IeB Scholia

And then down the page under "Holdings."

Its looking like a photocopy is held by the Library of Graduate School
of Letters and Faculty of Letters, Kyoto University. Maybe they'll
send through a PDF?


Best, Richard
