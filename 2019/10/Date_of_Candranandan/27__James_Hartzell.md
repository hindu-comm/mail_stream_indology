Hi 

Does anyone have a definitive date for Candranandana, author of the commentary Amṛtahṛdaya Aśṭāṅga Guhyopadeśatantra on Vāgbhaṭa´s Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya (or Aṣṭhāṅgasaṃhitā)?  According to the Tibetan medical history tradition, as reported in "The Origin of the rGyud bzhi: A Tibetan Medical Tantra” by Todd Fenner (https://www.thlib.org/encyclopedias/literary/genres/genres-book.php#!book=/studies-in-genres/b27/dn3/), Vairocana studied with him in Kashmir, and translated this text into Tibetan, and presented it to King Trisong Detsen (Tibetan: ཁྲི་སྲོང་ལྡེ་བཙན), who ruled (according to Wikipedia) 755 CE until 797 or 804 CE.  

Dr. Fenner´s history would place Candranandana in the late 8th century CE.  Has this account been further confirmed?

Cheers
James
