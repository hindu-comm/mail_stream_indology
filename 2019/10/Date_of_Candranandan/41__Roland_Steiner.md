Very possible, seems to me. In Śāradā, the two akṣaras tha and ṣa are  
semi-homograph. One could, therefore, speculate whether Thakkana was  
first misread to Ṣakkana/Ṣakuna and then improved to Śakuna. But it's  
just speculation, not more.

Nevertheless, it is also worth reading the section on Candranandana in  
Meulenbeld's "History of Indian Medicine" (see attachment).

Best wishes,
Roland
