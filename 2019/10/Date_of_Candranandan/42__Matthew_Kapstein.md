Dear Roland,

Unfortunately, Meulenbeld gives far too much credit to the legendary accounts of the Tibetan G.yu-thog-pa tradition, which, so far as I can see, are without historical value in the matter we are considering.

best,
Matthew

Very possible, seems to me. In Śāradā, the two akṣaras tha and ṣa are
semi-homograph. One could, therefore, speculate whether Thakkana was
first misread to Ṣakkana/Ṣakuna and then improved to Śakuna. But it's
just speculation, not more.

Nevertheless, it is also worth reading the section on Candranandana in
Meulenbeld's "History of Indian Medicine" (see attachment).

Best wishes,
Roland
