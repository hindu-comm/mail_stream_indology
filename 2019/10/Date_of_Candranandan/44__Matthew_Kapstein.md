As I see it, it is crucial that also Kalhaṇa mentions a ruler named
Thakkana (RT 6.230, 231, 236) as an adversary of Abhimanyu (ruled
958-972).

That is certainly correct, Roland - he must be the Tha ga na of the concluding verse.

Dear Mathew,

I am sure you are right, but it may be worthwhile to look at some of
the many references he has given.

As I see it, it is crucial that also Kalhaṇa mentions a ruler named
Thakkana (RT 6.230, 231, 236) as an adversary of Abhimanyu (ruled
958-972).

Best,
Roland
