Dear colleagues,

In the framework of the TST project (https://tst.hypotheses.org/) I have
started to examine rubbings and eye-copies of inscriptions kept at the BnF
in Paris.

Among these is the item “Indien 720”, for which we have the following
description: https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cc1046846

It appears to be a scale eye-copy of a Sanskrit inscription (which would be
in very big letters if it is indeed a scale reproduction, as the sheet is 200
x 95 mm).

>From the annotation on the sheet I gather that the inscription was
discovered in 1817 by a certain Franklin Lewis Cole (if I read correctly)
and the eye-copy made later, as the sheet is made with several sheets
having the watermark “B&T SWEETAPPLE 1829”. And there is a label “R.B. N°
52 1833” which refers to a collection (maybe Regis Bibliotheca, that is the
BnF name, I suppose, during the “Monarchie de Juillet”).

Here are some pictures:

Could any knowledgeable people among you enlighten me about this
inscription?

Especially concerning the placenames mentioned, Franklin Lewis Cole, and
any reference to a publication.

With a great many thanks in advance for any clue.

With very best wishes.
