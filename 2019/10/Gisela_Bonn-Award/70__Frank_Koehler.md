Dear colleagues,

I am happy to inform you that Prof. Heike Oberlin from the Dept. of  
Indology of the Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies at the  
University of Tübingen will be awarded this year's Gisela Bonn-Award.
Below is an excerpt from the announcement of the German-Indian Society:

The Indian Council of Cultural Relations donated this prize in 1996 in  
recognition of Professor Dr. Gisela Bonn, the great connoisseur of  
India and promoter of Indo-German relations. The chairman of the  
German-Indian Society e.V. is responsible for chairing the selection  
jury in accordance with the statutes of the prize. The Gisela Bonn  
Prize is awarded annually for special achievements in the field of  
Indo-German relations. It is primarily intended to honour the work of  
young scientists and journalists. The prize is not tied to any  
particular topic and covers the political, economic and cultural  
aspects of the relations between the two countries.
By financing a two-week trip to India, the prize-winner will be given  
the opportunity to continue and deepen her previous studies. If  
desired, the Indian Council of Cultural Relations will establish and  
organize contacts to local governmental or research institutions. The  
planning and organization of the trip will primarily depend on the  
wishes of the award winner.

The award ceremony will take place on October 26th in Halle at 12.00  
pm at the Francke Foundations as part of the Indientage 2019; in  
India, an analogue event is scheduled to take place in New Delhi at  
Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), presumably on December 9.
