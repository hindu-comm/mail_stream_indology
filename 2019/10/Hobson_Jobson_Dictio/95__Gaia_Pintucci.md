Dear list members,

Is there an edition/reprint of the Hobson Jobson dictionary you would
recommend above all others?
I am interested in acquiring a hard copy of it.

I see that in 2013 a *selected edition* appeared, edited by Kate Teltscher,
but I would like to get hold of an *unabridged* one.

NB: I am aware of the online resource that is hosted on the website of the
University of Chicago as well as of the existence of a freely available
pdf, but I am actually in search of an old-style book.

I shall be grateful for any tips.

With best wishes,
Gaia Pintucci
