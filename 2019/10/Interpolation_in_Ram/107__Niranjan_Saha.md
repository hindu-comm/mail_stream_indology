Dear list,

Namaste!

Please see if you could respond to Professor Bhattacharya's query below
(who I've marked a copy to).

''Do you know any Sanskritist well versed in the tenets of textual
criticism? My question is: Are the long Additional Passages in the critical
editions of the Harivamza, Mahabharata, RamayaNa, etc. to be treated as
interpolations or not''.




With regards,
Sincerely yours,
Niranjan Saha, PhD (London), PhD (ABD), Madras; FRAS
