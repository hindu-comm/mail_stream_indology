Dear Indologists,

You may find this to be amusing.

Visiting the huge exhibition of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec currently on view at the Grand Palais in Paris, I was surprised to find, amidst his many posters for theater and cabaret, the one I include here, for a production of the
Mṛcchakaṭikā, - the title is even given in devanagari at lower right. If you read carefully, you'll see that TL himself is credited with the sets for the fifth act, though I do not know if any trace of these survives, or if it was photographed. They must have been wonderful!
