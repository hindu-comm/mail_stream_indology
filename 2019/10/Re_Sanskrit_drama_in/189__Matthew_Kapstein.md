Dear Alakendu,

There are several English translations. The best known is perhaps the "Little Clay Cart" of the American Sanskritist Arthur Ryder, first published in 1905.

cordially,
Matthew

Dr.Kapstein,
I rue that I saw this post so late.It's indeed awe-inspiring.! I feel there exists an English version of MrchhaKatikam, namely The Clay Cart.I shall confirm it.

Dear Indologists,

You may find this to be amusing.

Visiting the huge exhibition of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec currently on view at the Grand Palais in Paris, I was surprised to find, amidst his many posters for theater and cabaret, the one I include here, for a production of the
Mṛcchakaṭikā, - the title is even given in devanagari at lower right. If you read carefully, you'll see that TL himself is credited with the sets for the fifth act, though I do not know if any trace of these survives, or if it was photographed. They must have been wonderful!
