Dear Sravana,

If nothing else, please encourage your student to read

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Reference material!!

Hello,

A student in my Introduction to Hinduism class wants to evaluate the epics from a literary perspective. He plans to do a character analysis and make references to modern literature. What scholarship would you all suggest?

Thank you.

Best,
Sravana
