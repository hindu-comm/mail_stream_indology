This is very sad news indeed.  Allison was a unique scholar, making
research contributions in the critically important area of post-14th
century South Asian studies.  Some of her many writings are available
at academia.edu
page <https://columbia.academia.edu/AllisonBusch>.  And her archive page
<http://icls.columbia.edu/author/ab2544columbia-edu/> at Columbia.

I was surprised and delighted a couple of years ago when I learned that
Allison grew up in Edmonton, Canada, where I now live.

My thoughts are with her family, friends and students.

Dominik
