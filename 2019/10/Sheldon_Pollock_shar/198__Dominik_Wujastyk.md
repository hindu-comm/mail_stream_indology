Sheldon Pollock is making available drafts of some of his editions and
translations in-progress in the hope that they may prove of some use to
others even in their draft state.

The first post is his *editio princeps* (along with all supporting
manuscript evidence) of Gopāla Bhaṭṭa’s *Rasatarańgiṇī*, the only
commentary on Rudra Bhaṭṭa’s *Śṛṅgāratilaka *(an *alańkāra* work datable to
around 1000 CE)*.* What makes this commentary additionally interesting is
that Gopāla Bhaṭṭa, a sixteenth-century scholar, should likely be
identified with the Gopāla Bhaṭṭa who was a direct discipline of Caitanya
and author of the most important ritual handbook of Bengali Vaishnavism,
the *Haribhaktivilāsa*.

These materials are available here <http://www.sheldonpollock.org/> under
"Works in Progress."
