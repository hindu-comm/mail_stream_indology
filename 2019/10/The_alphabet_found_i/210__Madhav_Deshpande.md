Dear Colleagues,

     As I have been reading the Lipiśālāsandarśana-Parivarta of the
Lalitavistara [p. 89, P. L. Vaidya edition], some interesting features of
the alphabet popped up for me.  The Alphabet omits *r̥* and *l̥*, but
includes *ai, au*, and *aḥ*. Among the consonants, it adds *kṣ *at the end
after *h*.  The version of this passage as given in the
Bauddhāgamārthasaṅgraha [ed by P. L. Vaidya] also omits *l*, while it is
included in the version of Lalitavistara edited by Vaidya himself.  I
wonder if there are textual variants about this.  I don't know what this
alphabet represents.  The omission of *r̥ *and *l̥ *goes along the
phonologies of Prakrits, but the inclusion of *ai, au*, and *aḥ* goes in
the direction of Sanskrit.  The addition of *kṣ *and the possible omission
of *l *point to something else that I cannot figure out.  Any suggestions
and references are welcome.
