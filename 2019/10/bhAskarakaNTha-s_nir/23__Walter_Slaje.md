Dear Colleagues,

the second volume of Bhāskarakaṇṭha's Mokṣopāya-Nirvāṇa-Ṭīkā has appeared,
edited by Bruno Lo Turco (Roma).

"This volume completes the critical edition of the large extant fragment of
the *Nirvāṇaprakaraṇa* — the sixth section of the *Mokṣopāya* — with the
commentary *Nirvāṇaṭīkā* of Bhāskarakaṇṭha, one of the last great
non-dualist Śaivite masters. The *Mokṣopāya*, a huge
philosophico-soteriological work probably composed by a Kashmiri author in
the tenth century of our era, was the original version of what would become
the *Yogavāsiṣṭha*, which enjoyed enormous popularity in India, in certain
regions second only to the two great epic poems."
