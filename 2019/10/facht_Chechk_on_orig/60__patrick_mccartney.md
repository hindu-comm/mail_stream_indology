Dear Friends,

Might anyone know of a potential textual source of this origin myth
paraphrased below. This is one of the origin myths of the
Telegu/mallabhāṣā-speaking Jettis.

*The second origin myth relates to Kṛṣṇa, who gave the caste a devamaṇi
(“divine” amulet); which was to be held for ten days each by one family
each representing every gotra of the caste. However, when the diamond was
passed on to the family representing the Viśvāmitra gotra, two brothers
fought for it; and, eventually, it was cut in half. Their guru cursed them
that they should live by breaking each other’s hands.*


Also, might anyone know of a descriptive grammar of the above mentioned
'mallabhāṣa'? I have come across snippets in old gazetteers of Mysore, etc.
Or throw away lines like, "they speak a deficient form of Prakrit called
mallabhāsā".


thanks.


All the best,

パトリック マッカートニー
