Dear list members,

In verse 3 of the ādyākālikāstotram (hundred names of Kali)

kṛpāmayī kṛpādhārā kṛpāpārā kṛpāgamā |

kṛśānuḥ kapilā kṛṣṇā kṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī || 3 ||


I've seen kṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī translated as "the one who increases the
bliss of Krishna", but it seemed strange to me that the god Krishna would
be mentioned in a hymn to Kali (or is it?).  Are there other translations
of  kṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī that would  make more sense in this context?

Thanks,

Harry Spier
