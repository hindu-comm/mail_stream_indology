Dear Herman,

it is called yogapaṭṭa in Sanskrit (and has various forms in NIA, e.g. jogauṭā in Avadhi), see this article:

Best,
Lubomir

(a few years ago I saw this contraption in a posh interior decorating shop in Leiden as an alternative chair!) Could anyone tell me if this strap, or sitting supported by this strap, had a (Sanskrit, MIA or NIA) name. By the way, it is not a particular Jaina practice. If I remember well, the strap can also be seen on, for instance, the Borobudur.
