Dear Mr. Spier,

Could it perhaps be a reference to Kṛṣṇānanda Āgamavāgīśa, the Tāntrika? See, e.g., Encountering Kālī, ed. McDermott and Kripal, p. 54.

Best wishes,
Michael

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Name of kāli in ādyākālikāstotram

Dear list members,

In verse 3 of the ādyākālikāstotram (hundred names of Kali)

kṛpāmayī kṛpādhārā kṛpāpārā kṛpāgamā |

kṛśānuḥ kapilā kṛṣṇā kṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī || 3 ||


I've seen kṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī translated as "the one who increases the bliss of Krishna", but it seemed strange to me that the god Krishna would be mentioned in a hymn to Kali (or is it?).  Are there other translations of  kṛṣṇānandavivarddhinī that would  make more sense in this context?

Thanks,

Harry Spier
