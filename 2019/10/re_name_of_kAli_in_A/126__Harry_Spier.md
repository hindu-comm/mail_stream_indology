Dear Michael,

I did find this website "Shri Krishna as Kali"
http://www.shivashakti.com/krishna.htm by Mike McGee that says " . . .In
places in the tantrik tradition, the Krishna avatar of Vishnu is often
identified with Kali.  This reaches a peak in the Tantrajajatantra, where
it is said that having already charmed the world of men as herself, Lalita
took a male form as Krishna and then proceeded to enchant women.  . . . In
the Todala Tantra, each of the ten Mahavidyas, forms of the supreme
Goddess, has her own male counterpart and here Krishna is said to be the
spouse of Kali
...

He also shows a victorian print of Radha worshipping Krishna as Kali.

Can someone say if this information is accurate.

Thanks,
Harry Spier

Thanks,
Harry Spier
