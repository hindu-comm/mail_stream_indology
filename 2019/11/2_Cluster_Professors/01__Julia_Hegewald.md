Dear colleagues and friends,

I would like to draw your attention to two new positions. They are professorships in the Cluster for Dependency and Slavery Studies at the University of Bonn, which have just been advertised. 
One of them has a focus on Research Area A (Semantics, Lexical Fields, and Narratives) and the one focusses on topics of Research Area E (Gender and Intersectionality). 

You can find the calls here: https://www.dependency.uni-bonn.de/en/career <https://www.dependency.uni-bonn.de/en/career>
