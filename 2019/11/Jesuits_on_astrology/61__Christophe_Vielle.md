See also on astrology and astronomy in Malabar the chapter (19) devoted to the science of the brahmins in the Jesuit Portuguese work, dated ca. 1615 , by
Diogo Gonçalves S. I., Historia do Malavar (Hs. Goa 58 des Arch. Rom. S. I.), ed. Josef Wicki, Münster: Aschendorff, 1955 (Missionswissenschaftliche Abhandlungen und Texte, 20), p. 27 sv. (see also on the writing, and on the malayalam and Sanskrit languages p. 29-30).
Charles Julius Borges, of the Loyola College (Baltimore), had once the project to translate this very interesting work in English, but no news thereabout.

Dear Martin,

your colleague might be interested in what Dhruv Raina wrote on the topic, and refer to the bibliography in his article:

Raina, Dhruv. 2003. “Betwixt Jesuit and Enlightenment Historiography: Jean-Sylvain Bailly’s History of Indian Astronomy.” Revue d’Histoire Des Mathématiques 9 (2): 253–306.
Raina, Dhruv. 2010. “The French Jesuit Manuscripts on Indian Astronomy: The Narratology and Mystery Surrounding a Late Seventeenth – Early Eighteenth Century Project.” In F.Bretelle-Establet (Ed.) Looking at It from Asia: The Processes That Shaped the Sources of History of Science, 115–140. Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Springer.

Dear Martin,

I have been working on a similar subject since some years and I intend
to write a book (not before 2 or 3 years). Unhappily, I am studying only
the French part of it, since many French Jesuits were good astronomers
and either observed the sky in India or got informed there about Indian
astronomy.
The best sources to begin with are :
Le P.Antoine Gaubil S.J., Correspondance de Pékin 1722-1759, publiée par
Renée Simon, Droz, Genève, 1970, and
The biographies of Jesuits by Sommervogel, which appeared in many
volumes. If you are interested by the French connection, I can give you
a list of names.
I also wrote an article on the European astronomers at the court of Jai
Singh II (they were Jesuits) in the Journal des Savants, 2013,
p.175-192.

Best,

Jean Michel
