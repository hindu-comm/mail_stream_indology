Of course, dearest Professor Olivelle! Thanks for reminding us of Hallesey’s translation. Not to mention Norman’s oeuvre.

In my work I present also the (compelling, enthralling, and at time troubled) story/history of the birth of the Order of the nuns (bhikkhunī-saṅgha), and a summary of the Buddha’s teachings.
Two useful additions, I hope...

With the highest esteem, Yours Daniela
