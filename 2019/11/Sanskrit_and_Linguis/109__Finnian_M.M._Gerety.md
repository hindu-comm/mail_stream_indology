Hi all—
A colleague has asked me to recommend scholarship (monograph, essay, review article) that provides an overview on the nexus of Sanskrit, modern linguistics, and/or the philosophy of language. Any recommendations from this list—especially works accessible to the non-specialist—would be much appreciated. 

Yours,

Finnian M.M. Gerety
