Dear Madhav and Matthew,


For what it's worth, texts that describe the /cakras/ (tantras & /haṭha 
yoga/) routinely add/kṣa/ after the /ha/. They are placed in the two 
petals of the /āj̇ñā cakra/. Padoux discusses the addition of/kṣa/ on p. 
156 of his book /Vāc/:


"...finally the compound phoneme/kṣa/, the addition of which is 
sometimes justified on theoretical grounds because it logically fits in 
a given metaphysical system; but the real reason of its being placed 
there is difficult to ascertain, except perhaps as a means to have fifty 
phonemes rather than forty-nine. Naturally, since each phoneme is a form 
of energy, it is correlated with a deity. There are several texts giving 
differing lists of these fifty divinized energies."


One could speculate that is was added in order to fill up all the petals 
in the /cakras/, but that would imply that the number of petals in seven 
/cakras/ was fixed before the addition of /kṣa/.


Padoux, André. 1992. /Vāc://The Concept of the Word in Selected Hindu 
Tantras/. Translated by J. Gontier. Delhi: Sri Satguru Publications. 
Originally published by SUNY.
