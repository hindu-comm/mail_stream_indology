Dear Professor Lusthaus,

the explanation is not difficult to give. As is well-known (at least among
Vedicists), Wilson translated more or less "Sāyaṇa's" view-point only, but
certainly not the Rigvedic text as such, as his posthumous editors E.B.
Cowell and W. F. Webster readily admit themselves in their respective
introductions. This is also briefly dealt with in my preface to this
volume, but actually, the very fact as such is not new at all. Wilson is
not reckoned among Vedicists in the strict sense, whereas Ludwig certainly
is.

Kindly regarding,
Walter Slaje
