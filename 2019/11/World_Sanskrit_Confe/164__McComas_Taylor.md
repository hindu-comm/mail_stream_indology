Apologies for cross-posting...

Dear Colleagues,

The WSC2021  second circular is attached and is also available through our website:

https://www.wsc2021.com.au/

We warmly invite all interested scholars to submit abstracts to our regular sections or special panels through the website portal.

(We are also looking for suitably interested scholars to coordinate our new section, 'Gender and Sanskrit Studies' - please contact me off list)

Looking forward to hosting you all in Canberra in 2021,

Yours fraternally,

McComas Taylor
On behalf of the WSC2021 Organising Committee
