Dear Readers,

To avoid any possible misunderstandings, I would like to state, once 
again, that Dr. Bagchee has never been affiliated with the Institut für 
Indologie und Tibetologie of the University of Munich, in any way. Nor 
does he ever seem to have approached us. (We would not have accepted his 
kind of work as academically or otherwise intellectually beneficial 
anyway.)

His being listed here among the panelists as “Joydeep Bagchee, 
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität of Munich” qualifies as masquerading, to 
the detriment of my institution. As Dr. Grünendahl has already 
mentioned, Dr. Bagchee is not entitled to suggest such a connection.

Dr. Bagchee’s very brief affiliation with another department of the 
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität expired already a year ago, and he was 
explicitly requested by the head of that department to no longer use the 
LMU affiliation. I leave it to the readers on this list, and especially 
to the organizers of that exploratory session at the AAR meeting, to 
draw their own conclusions from this about the academic integrity of the 
person(s) who are responsible for this false mention of affiliation, 
whether Dr. Bagchee and / or others.

Robert Zydenbos
