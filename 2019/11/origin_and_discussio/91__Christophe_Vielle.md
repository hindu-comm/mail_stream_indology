>From a quick look at the index of Jean-Marie Verpoorten's Mīmāṃsā Literature (with refs to pp. 20, 24, 30, 46), the discussion on the apauruṣeya(tva) occurs in  Śabara's commentary on MS 1,1,5 and 1,1,27-32 (cf.  the § "Veda not the work of a personal being" in G. Jha, Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā in its source, 1942, p. 126-127), in Kumārila ŚV (20, cf. D'SA, Śabdaprāmāṇya in  Śabara and Kumārila, Vienna, De Nobili Research Library, 1980, p. 197) and BṬ (cf. D'SA p. 189), and also in the Mīmāṃsā (12th) chapter of the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha.
Here two of his own papers on the subject:

That is:

- The 24th Chapter of the Tattvasaṃgraha: Refutation of the Mīmāṃsā doctrine of vedāpauruṣeyatva, Studies in Mīmāṃsā: Dr. Mandan Mishra Felicitation Volume, éd. R. C. Dwivedi, Delhi, 1994, pp. 117-129.

- La querelle de la Mīmāṃsā et du Bouddhisme autour de l’éternité du Véda, L’Orient des Dieux (publ. of the Université Saint-Joseph, Beyrouth) 6-7, 2006-2007, pp. 5-20.

See also by Kiyotaka Yoshimizu in Bronkhorst ed. 2007, pp. 220-224

https://www.academia.edu/32176020/_Kumārila_s_Reevaluation_of_the_Sacrifice_and_the_Veda_from_a_Vedānta_Perspective._

and the book of Elstchinger - Krasser and Taber, Can the Veda speak? Dharmakīrti against Mīmāṃsā exegetics and Vedic authority, Vienna: OAW, 2012.

This is only a few references on the topic, related to PM. The apauruṣeyatva of the Veda is also something found with Bhartṛhari and Maṇḍana Miśra (Hugo David is saying that somewhere).

Does anyone know the origin of the term and concept that the Vedas are "nitya apaurusheya", eternal and uncreated by humans?

I have heard it might have originated in Karma Mimamsa.

Also, any information about how it was conceived, discussed and debated would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Dean
