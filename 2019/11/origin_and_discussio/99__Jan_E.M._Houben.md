Dear Patrick and Madhav,
The discussion can indeed be extended from the six "orthodox" philosophical
systems, to, on the one hand, the dharmaśāstras (where Mīmāṃsā principles
of interpretation find a natural, extended domain of application -- perhaps
hence also the Mīmāṃsā view on the nityatva of the Veda?), and, on the
other hand, to the R̥gveda.
Views that the Vedas -- the Vedic hymns -- are of primordial origin or are
given beforehand, and, in the  Puruṣa-sūkta, literally of pauruṣeya origin,
as rks, sāmans, yajus-formulas deriving from the primordial Puruṣa, can
definitely be found in the R̥gveda.
So also views that the Vedas -- Vedic hymns -- are and should be (newly)
created with much effort by the inspired poets, just as a carpenter creates
a chariot etc.
Writing on the Vedic poet's comparison of his work with that of a
"carpenter or cartwright", Jan Gonda *Vision of the Vedic Poets* 1963: p.
184 quotes Louis Renou's translation of
RV 7.64.4 yó vām gártam mánasā táksad etám / ūrdhváam dhītím kṛṇávad
dhāráyac ca ...
"celui qui charpentera votre trône en pensée, qui mettra haut-et-droit ce
poème-ci et le maintiendra ..." (Renou EVP V (1958), p. 88).
Best, Jan Houben
