Dear Adheesh,

in case you don't know about it, there is also:
Philipp Maas' article on Yoga in the Śiśupālavadha (published in Adaptive
Reuse: Aspects of Creativity in South Asian Cultural History, which you can
download here
<https://www.academia.edu/31005848/Adaptive_Reuse_Aspects_of_Creativity_in_South_Asian_Cultural_History>
).

Best wishes with your research!
