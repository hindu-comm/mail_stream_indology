Dear Colleagues:

I would like to offer my sincere gratitude for all of your valuable resources and suggestions with regard to kāvya-based depictions of yoga, and related scholarship. It has given the student much to work with, and we are hopeful that it might prove to be a fruitful area of investigation for an MA thesis. We are compiling a bibliography based on your suggestions, and will post the results to the list. 

Thanks again for all of your thoughtful responses,

with best wishes,
Adheesh
