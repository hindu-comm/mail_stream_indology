CORRECTION:

Dr. Joydeep Bagchee was listed in our proposal as an independent scholar by his request; the LMU affiliation was kicked in through old data in the AAR system. Paper selections are peer reviewed and not based on university affiliations; I hope this clarifies things for all parties concerned.

Dear INDOLOGY List,

If you will be at the AAR meeting on Monday the 25th, please plan to join us at an exploratory session on "The Mahābhārata: A Text for Classical Hinduism.” We will seek to establish whether sufficient interest exists to justify the creation of a five-year seminar dedicated to the Mahābhārata. Rather than present papers, we will articulate the case for such a seminar, soliciting participation from fellow AAR members. Details below.

Monday - 9:00 AM-11:30 AM
