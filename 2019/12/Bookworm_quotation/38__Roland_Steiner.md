> I finally printed on our catalog cards: “damaged by worms, rats,  
> fire, water” — and crossed out the items that did not apply...

That is why we had placed the following verse at the entrance of the  
former Indological library in Marburg:

udakānalacaurebhyo mūṣakebhyo viśeṣataḥ
kaṣṭena likhitaṃ śāstraṃ yatnena paripālayet

(Böhtlingk, Indische Sprüche, Nr. 1227 = Subhāṣitārṇava 96)

Cheers,
Roland Steiner
