Hi Chris,

thanks for sharing this, it's a really great resource.
Do you consider to release the source data at some point in the future?
They could be highly interesting for all kinds of computational
research, especially since there is so much (manually annotated?)
information linking individual text passages, and text passages with
their translations.

Best, Oliver
