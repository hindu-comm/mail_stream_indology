Dear Patrick,

C. V. Vaidya discusses the saying in History of Mediaeval Hindu India, vol. 2, appendix IV, “Genesis of the Dictum kalāvādyantayoḥ sthitiḥ” (Poona, 1924, pp. 312-317). He argues that it must have emerged sometime between 1300 and 1600, though he was unable to trace its original source.

With best wishes for the new year,

A colleague who is no on this list asked whether anyone can trace this expression: kalāv ādyantayos sthitiḥ. Any clues? Thanks.


Patrick
