Dear Madhav,

That was my misprint, not the book’s. It does indeed read कलावाद्यन्तयोः स्थितिः

However, this quote is one of the several texts cited to argue that there are no real Kṣatriyas (and Vaiśyas) in the Kali age.  The other famous quotes used in this debate are Purāṇic lines नन्दान्तं क्षत्रियकुलम् and इत: प्रभृति शूद्रा भूपाला भविष्यन्ति, along with the story of Paraśurāma exterminating the Kṣatriyas 21 times.

This quote was the basis for rejecting the Kṣatriyahood of some kings during the medieval times.
