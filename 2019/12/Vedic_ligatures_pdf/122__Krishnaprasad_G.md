Dear all
  I am  looking for different Vedic ligatures used earlier in the printed
books, so that I can check the fonts for errors. Any pointers will be
highly appreciated.
I have Madhyandina samhita book sent by Sri Madhav Deshpande Ji, and Sama
veda book where I can refer the different ligatures for my fonts. How ever
I am not able to find  Atharva Veda book with Satwalekar edition.

PS here is small comparison with Bold Nirnaysagar fonts and Normal weight.
and some Vedic accents.
