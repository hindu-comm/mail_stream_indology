Victor D'Avella in his PhD thesis (Creating the Perfect Language: Sanskrit Grammarians, Poetry, and the Exegetical Tradition) says (p. 355):

I recall a verse that H. V. Nagaraja Rao once recited to me and which I have since
located in the prefatory verses of Devabodha’s Jñānadīpikā [note 17: Many thanks to Harunaga Isaacson and Whitney Cox, who independently pointed out this reference to me.] and Kṛṣṇa Śeṣa Prakāśa:

yāny ujjahāra māhendrād vyāso vyākaraṇārṇavāt |
tāni kiṃ śabdaratnāni santi pāṇinigoṣpade || (Jñānapradīpikā, p. 2) [note 18: PrKPra vol. III p. 6.14 with the variant maheśād for mahendrād.]

“Are the gems of speech, which Vyāsa has retrieved out of the ocean of grammar
from great Indra, to be found in Pāṇini’s puddle?”
