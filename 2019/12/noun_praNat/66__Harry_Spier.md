 Dear list members,

Verse 3 of a version of the Devi Suktam I have agrees with the verse in the
Markendaya Purana in GRETIL.


kalyāṇyai praṇatāṁ vṛddhyai siddhyai kurmo namo namaḥ

nairṛtyai bhūbhṛtāṁ lakṣmyai śarvāṇyai te namo namaḥ


I've been told  praṇatāṁ is the genitive plural of the noun praṇat .

But  praṇat is not in Monier-Williams or in Bohtlink-Roth .

Note: nat is in MW    "nat mfn. (√ nam) bowing, bowing one's self (ifc.)"

but not in Boehtlink-Roth.

1) Can someone confirm that   praṇatāṁ in the verse is genitive plural of
praṇat (and not feminine accusative of   praṇatā)

2) Has anyone come across the noun  praṇat anywhere in the literature.

Thanks,

Harry Spier
