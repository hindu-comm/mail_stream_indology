Dear Johannes,

Anantalal Thakur, “Cannibhaṭṭa and the authorship of the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha” Bulletin of the Adyar Library  25(1961): 524–538, gives some citations from the work of Cannibhaṭṭa, whom he holds to have been the real author.

I'll be most interested if you come up with anything else.

all best,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha


Dear colleagues,



Are there Sanskrit texts that quote or refer to the Sarvadarśanasaṃgraha? The text was known to Wilson in 1828 and a printed edition appeared for the first time in 1858. Are there authors during the preceding centuries who show an awareness of the text (apart from copyists who copied it)? Thanks in advance for any suggestions.



Johannes Bronkhorst
