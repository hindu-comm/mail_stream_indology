Dear all,

Triśaṅku's sacrifice is certainly loaded with terminology (e.g., ṛtvij,
sruva) pointing the audience towards envisioning a proper vedic affair, so
I would certainly agree with Dominik that there is an intentional resonance
between the Vedas and the epic.  And our understanding of "saśarīra" is
likely to be colored similarly.  Also, the question of saśarīra vs.
svaśarīra is a great one.  The Triśaṅku episode appears somewhat
noncommittal in a distinction between the two, though I suspect other
genre's may have more to say on the subject -- which I suppose is one thing
I am hoping to sort through by posing my original question.  On a quick
glance through just the Triśaṅku episode (VR 1.56.10-1.59.33), however, I
noticed a few things:

1. saśarīra is a bit more common.  By my count, it occurs nine times versus
svaśarīra's five (with one occurrence splitting the prefix sva- and
declining it adjectivally)

2. svaśarīra shows up in a few different situations, but it is notably
never said by Triśaṅku himself.  It first shows up when the story's
narrator (Śatānanda) introduces Rāma to the character Triśaṅku.  Its only
other occurrences are when Viśvāmitra is either discussing Triśaṅku with
Vasiṣṭha's sons or addressing Triśaṅku directly.

3. Both Śatānanda and Viśvāmitra seem to use the two terms
interchangeably.  Viśvāmitra even says them in adjacent verses (e.g.,
1.59.14-15).

4. Because Triśaṅku never uses svaśarīra, his direct statements of his
intent to go to a heavenly realm always use saśarīra.

5. Of course, the Triśaṅku episode presents a special complication when
considering whether a body is one's own or not.  Triśaṅku is not, in a
sense, in his original body when he approaches Viśvāmitra -- he was cursed
to be *caṇḍālarūpin*.  Viśvāmitra even suggests that Triśaṅku will go to
heaven in the cursed *caṇḍāla* form and uses saśarīra in his dialogue
(1.58.4).  That Viśvāmitra is confident that Triśaṅku would enter heaven in
such a form is especially significant when viewed in comparison to the
Śambūka story.

I'm sure there is more to be unpacked here, but this is an initial glance.

With best wishes,
Aaron
