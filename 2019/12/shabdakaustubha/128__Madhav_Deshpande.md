Dear Colleagues,

     With print copies and digital copies of various parts, I have Bhaṭṭoji
Dīkṣita's Śabdakaustubha only upto the end of the 4th Adhyāya.  Was the
remaining Śabdakaustubha ever published?  And if so, does anyone have
access to it?  Perhaps, I should look for manuscripts of Śabdakaustubha for
this remaining portion.
