Dear Prof. Jha,

A search of the digital text of the Srimad Bhagavata Purana from GRETIL (
http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/3_purana/bhagp/bhp1-12u.htm)
does not turn up this word. I searched for "māyik" in order to allow for
and discount any possible sandhi combinations of the first and last vowel
of the word. The text available at GRETIL does not say what edition was
input. Probably the word you are seeking occurs in a different edition.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
