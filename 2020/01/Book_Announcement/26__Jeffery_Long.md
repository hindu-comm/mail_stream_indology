Dear Colleagues,



I am happy to announce thatAn Introduction to Jain Philosophyby Parveen Jain is now available onAmazonor through thebook’s website.Drawing on an extraordinary collection of writings and discourses by Ācārya Sushil Kumar and on the author’s own self-studies as a lifelong practitioner, the book distills the fundamental tenets of Jain philosophy for both academic and non-academic audiences.An Introduction to Jain Philosophypresents a great overview of what Jain thinkers have to say about the universal issues of the human condition — and how we might understand and enhance our relationship with other living beings as a powerful and effective spiritual journey.This would be a fantastic primary source for an upper level undergraduate course on Jainism or modern Indian philosophy and a nice addition to either your personal or institutional library.
