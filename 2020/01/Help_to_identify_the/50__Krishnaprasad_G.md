Dear all

In the book titled "Second book of Sanskrit" there are verses appear in
couple of chapters, the author of the Second book of Sanskrit says that the
verses are addressing to a King named Krishna. Could anyone identity the
name of the work and author of the same.

Page 4
तद्विद्विषां जरति चेतसि भोगतृष्णा ।
तेषां वपूंषि विपिनेषु च जारयन्ति।।
सहते शस्त्रसंपातं सहति श्रममाहवे etc


Any help is highly appreciated
Thanks and Regards
KP
