The application deadline for the the International Association of Sanskrit Studies 'Professor Ram Karan Sharma Award' has been extended to September 30, 2020. The winner of this Award will be announced at the 18th World Sanskrit Conference in Canberra, Australia, 18–22 January, 2021. The Award is valued at 1000 USD.
