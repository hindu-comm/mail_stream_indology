Dear Friends:

With apologies for cross-listing — and following upon the searchable transcript of Vijñāneśvara’s Mitākṣarā commentary on the Yājñavalkya Smṛti, which Don Davis announced a few days ago, I want to alert you to two Indexes of Citations found in that same text, and another one of Devana Bhaṭṭa’s Smṛticandrikā, perhaps the best Dharmanibandha. You can access them at:

https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/southasia/language-resources/languages.php

Just scroll down to “Sanskrit” and you will find them. Hopefully, these will be useful for your own research.

With best wishes,


Patrick Olivelle
