Respected scholars,"Bhamati" written and composed by Bachaspati Misra , as a commentary on Shankaracharya' version of Brahma Sutra, takes it's name from his wife by the same name.It may be a curious query to search if any records exist about the person named Bhamati, Bachaspati Misra's wife? .... whether she played any significant role in helping her husband compose this Magnum Opus..
    Alakendu Das.
