Also the  dīrgha-svarita is used in chanting books of the Rudram but on
looking at a few different editions of the  taitirīya-saṁhitā (Sastri and
Mahadeva, Sntakke and Dharmadhikari, and Satvalekar, as far as I can
see dīrgha-svarita
isn't used in these editions (most of these are multi-volume editions so
its possible its used in other volumes than those I looked at).

Does anyone know of any editions of the taitirīya-saṁhitā where  dīrgha-svarita
is used?

Thanks,
Harry Spier
