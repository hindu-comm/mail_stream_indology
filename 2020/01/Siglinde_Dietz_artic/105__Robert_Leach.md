Dear List members,

I'd be very grateful if anyone could provide me with a soft copy of the
following article. The book it's in appears to be hard to come by.

S. Dietz "The Meaning of kṛtya-kākhorda-mantra-veṭāḍa" in *Dharmadūta.
Mélanges offerts au Vénérable Thích Huyên-Vi*, edited by D. T. Dhammaratana
& B. Pāsādika, Éditions You-Feng, 1997.

Many thanks in advance to anyone who can help!

Robert
