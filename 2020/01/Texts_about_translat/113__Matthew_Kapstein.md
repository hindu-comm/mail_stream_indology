One issue that seems not yet to have been raised in this thread is that of chAyA, which is of course a type of translation from Prakrit to Sanskrit. I would be most interested if anyone knows of any reflections on or theoretization of (or jokes about!) chAyA within the Indian sources.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Texts about translations

Dear Nataliya,

While not commentarial on translation per sē, I have an article that has just come out in the Wiley-Blackwell's Companion to World Literature in which I try to use the aesthetic sensibilities of the Rgveda to imagine what it would consider essential to a graceful translation itself (hint: the enigma of the imagery has to remain, well... enigmatic). It is aimed at a comparative lit audience rather than a strictly philological one, but if you would like a copy, I am happy to send you a PDF.

Best,
Caley
