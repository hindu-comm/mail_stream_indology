Dear Colleagues,

I am very pleased to announce the immediate availability of a searchable, digital edition of the Mitākṣarā of Vijñāneśvara, the twelfth-century commentary on the Yājñavalkya-dharmaśāstra. The text in the Nirnaya Sagar edition was transcribed by Amy Hyne-Sutherland, Nikola Rajić, and myself. Recently, Patrick Olivelle took the time to check the transcription and to color code its external citations and authors mentioned. Though we know errors still remain, we hope the availability of this major dharmaśāstra commentary in digital form will facilitate new and more research in this area and encourage the transcription of other such texts. Kindly let us know if you find corrections to be made. We will make the text available at other repositories in due course.

You can find the link under “Sanskrit” on the Language Resources page of UT-Austin’s South Asia Institute:

Happy searching,

Don Davis (and Patrick Olivelle)
Department of Asian Studies
University of Texas at Austin
