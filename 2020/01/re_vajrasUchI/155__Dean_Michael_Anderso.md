 I'd be hesitant in using terms like ākāśagamin to date a text unless there was an indication that it was part of a larger established doctrine. Those kinds of abilities were regularly mentioned.

The idea of sages moving through space is mentioned as early as Rig Veda X.136 although it uses different terminology.
In a forthcoming publication, I discuss how those types of experiences may be part of a body of experiences that are universal psychological responses to certain psychophysiological stimuli such as meditative practices, entraining to rhythmic chanting, drugs, etc. (See Yoga Sutras 4.1) I call it the yogic-shamanic continuum. Given that, using such experiences alone to date a text would probably be misleading.
Best,
Dean

 The idea of practitioners who become ākāśagamin is already in the Yogasūtra (4th-5th century? earlier?) which explains how to do it; pre-tantra. The term is probably older.

Allow me to add a word of caution about chronology with respect to Manu. Even ifVajrasūcī 12 explicitly refers to Mānava Dharmaśāstra 5.48, theVasiṣṭha Dharmasūtra (4.7) does the same (being much closer to Manu's text). And yet, Olivelle considers theMānava Dharmaśāstra "clearly posterior to Vasiṣṭha".

There are other cases which show that even literal quotations from and references to Manu do not necessarily prove that the text concerned is posterior to Manu. I discuss them in detail in the following article:

nākṛtvā prāṇināṃ hiṃsāṃ māṃsam utpadyate kvacit |na ca prāṇivadhaḥ svargyas tasmān māṃsaṃ vivarjayet || 48 ||

One can never obtain meat without causing injury to living beings,and killing living beings is an impediment to heaven; he should, therefore, abstain from meat.

While this reference may be considered as providing sufficient philologicalevidence for historically assuming VS to be later than MDh, the fact that thenotion of anākāśagāmin corresponds to that of akhecara would at least notcontradict the assumption that the author of theVajrasūcī may in fact havebeen associated with the social sphere of thesiddhācāryas, being also thesphere of Vajrayāna.

Another twist of the story is provided by the respective arguments forabstaining from consuming pieces of flesh from the corpses of brutallyslaughtered animals, given particularly in Mahāyāna, prior to the antinomianVajrayāna practice of ritually consuming flesh, the main Buddhist reasonfor not harming any living beings has been compassion (cf., e.g., the conciseoutline in Schmithausen’s “The Case of Vegetarianism – A BuddhistPerspective” [https://tinyurl.com/qqxhvrf]). – Comparing the two verses quoted above, it is inMDh 5.48, where compassion is appealed to. TheVajrasūcī,contrary to what we might expect, is not doing so. How to historically accountfor this evidence? Could it be that, while likewise casting a side-glance at hisspace-walking colleagues,siddhācārya Aśvaghoṣa’s intention has been to alsoinclude them in his critique of animal corpse consumers?

Dear Vincent,
Thank you for your further comments.
I didn’t mean to suggest that the yukta pramāṇa described in the Caraka Saṃhitā was the same as the dharmārthayuktaṃ vacanaṃpramāṇam of the Vajrasūcī. Only that a pramāṇa explicitly based on yukta (however one parses that phrase) is something seen early on, and then it disappears. The yukta-pramāṇa of the Caraka is a fascinating thing whose loss probably was a loss for the entire Indian philosophical enterprise. Farmers and doctors shared a common concern, which is that to get from initial cause to actual fruition involves a process in time of multiple causes, with multiple stages, any of which can effect or nullify the outcome: planting a crop and being able to harvest; pregnancy making it to term; etc. Taking all relevant factors into account and calculating the probabilities of a successful final outcome was what yukta pramāṇa was designed to accomplish. In some ways, that is closer to the probabalistic reasoning that has displaced causal thinking in western philosophy (and some sciences) since the early 20th c than the more mechanistic cause and invariant effect reasoning more prevalent in Indian thought. Obviously, the Caraka’s yukta pramāṇa is not the same thing as drawing knowledge through discourse employing reasoning based on dharma and artha (or the meaning/purpose of dharma).
The idea of prototypical ideas that emerge later under the rubric of Mīmāṃsā is intriguing. The Yogācārabhūmi is an often ignored treasure trove of ideas circulating in India earlier than is often recognized (as is the Tattvasiddhi, though not adequately captured in Sastri’s translations, in which many of the stock arguments repeated in pramāṇavāda texts are already found). Squeamishness about sacrifices is quite early — Jains and even Sāṃkhyans express those ideas, and one can see some reaction against that even in the Bhagavad Gītā (whether one dates that to 200 BCE or 200 CE). Dignāga does deal withMīmāṃsā in PS, for which there is no (available) Chinese translation. (There is a hint that a one fascicle translation was made, but no evidence of it aside from a mention of its title in a catalogue of translations).
The Chinese sources frequently cite a school by its founder’s name instead of the name of the school. Typically:Kapila迦毘羅, the founder of Sāṃkhya數論; Ulūka優樓佉(a.k.a. Kaṇâda食米齋), the founder of Vaiśeṣika勝論宗, and Ṛṣabha勒沙婆, the founder of the Nirgranthas.
As far as I can find, there is no Chinese version of Jaimini’s name. Again, I would be happy to learn otherwise.

Dear Dan,My impression is that the Buddhists became aware of Mīmāṃsā as a distinct religio-philosophical school (and not just as a purely intra-Brahmanical type of “theological/exegetical” inquiry) some time duringthe fourth century CE (or perhaps in the early fifth), even though the term may not occur, at least not regularly, before Dignāga (480-540). It is also around the fourth century CE that certain Buddhists started arguing against ideas that are close to those known to us from later Mīmāṃsaka sources (e.g., on sacrificial violence, the caste-classes, etc.), even though several among these ideas find interesting prototypes in theMānavadharmaśāstra. This is especially the case in the so-calledparavādasection of theYogācārabhūmi. Hundreds of pages could be written on these topics.The stanza you quote is arguably the most important in theVajrasūcī, for it spells out the philosophical-polemical program of the entire work. A rough translation might be: “The Vedas are authoritative (pramāṇa); the Smṛtis are authoritative; [any] speech/discourse endowed/connected (yukta) withdharmaandarthais authoritative. A [person] for whom a [previously acknowledged]pramāṇawould cease (na bhavet) to be apramāṇa[because it contradicts his/her position on the issue of the caste-classes], who [on earth] would take his/her speech/discourse to be apramāṇa/authoritative?” One can certainly discuss the exact structure and meaning of the compounddharmārthayukta, but seriouslydoubt thatyuktaherehas anything to dowith thepramāṇathe medical tradition refers to asyukti(see articles by Filliozat, Steinkellner, and others). Or did I miss the point?I entirely agree with you as regards Sāṃkhya and Vaiśeṣika: from the 1st-2ndto the 5thcentury, these traditions/schools are the most frequent targets of the Buddhist controversialists. The Nyāya (works by [the pseudo?]Nāgārjuna) and the Mīmāṃsā play a comparatively minor role, as do the Jains (targeted as early as Āryadeva’sCatuḥśataka, and more frequently from theYogācārabhūmionwards).Very best,Vincent

Betreff:Re: [INDOLOGY] VajrasūcīDear all,
Just to comment quickly, though I haven’t studied the Vajrasūcī in any depth, the same passage that Vincent highlighted, naming the Vedas, Grammarians, et al. is also the one that caught my attention, especially the mention of Mīmāṃsikas. As far as I can tell, while the others do get mentioned in Chinese translations of Buddhist texts, the only text preserved in Chinese that mentions Mīmāṃsikas is Xuanzang’s translation of Bhāviveka’s Prajñāpradīpa, which mentions them twice in close proximity:
《般若燈論釋》卷13〈22 觀如來品〉：「復有彌息伽外道言。佛家所說十二部經[1]者。非一切智人所說。有作者故。譬如鞞世師等論。」(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, b15-17)[1]者＝有【宮】。[1]者＝有【宮】。“Again there are the non-Buddhist (tīrthika) Mīmāmsikas who say: ‘What is said by Buddhists In the twelve divisions of the their sūtras (canon), is that no person is omniscient, because they are conditioned (saṃskṭra), just as is stated in treatises by the Vaiśeṣikas, and so on.”
《般若燈論釋》卷13〈22 觀如來品〉：「如彌息伽外道所計韋陀聲是常者」(CBETA, T30, no. 1566, p. 119, c5-6)“This like the non-Buddhist Mīmāmsikas who imagine that the Word of the Vedas is eternal.”
I have found no other mention of Mīmāṃsā in any other Chinese sources (if anyone has information on discussions I might have missed, please let me know). Bhāviveka, of course, devoted an entire chapter in his Madhyamakahṛdaya toMīmāṃsā, but his description of their doctrines suggests they differed in several ways from the versions we are more familiar with post Prābhākara and Kumārila. It is the latter’sŚlokavarttika, of course, that made Mīmāṃsā hard to ignore for subsequent Buddhists.
Harivarman’sTattvasiddhi(translated by Kumārajīva at the beginning of the 5th c) identifies (among others) Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Nyāya, and Jains as pūrvapakṣins. More generally in Buddhist literature preserved in Chinese prior to the middle of the seventh century, the most commonly cited opponents are Vaiśeṣika and Sāṃkhya. Nyāya is mentioned infrequently, as are Jains.
As for the pramāṇa issue mentioned by Matthew, the Vajrasūrī verse identifies what serve as authorities for non-Buddhists (the following verse turns to lineage):
vedāḥpramāṇaṃ smṛtayaḥpramāṇaṃdharmārthayuktaṃ vacanaṃpramāṇam |
yasya pramāṇaṃna bhavetpramāṇaṃkastasya kuryādvacanaṃpramāṇam || 2 ||
Which are more or less equivalent to śruti, smṛti, and āpti-pramāṇa, and analogous to “scripture and reason” (āgama, yukti) that was the established criteria for validity for Buddhists, even into the pramāṇavāda era. And, as I wrote elsewhere:

"Pramāṇa-theory rst appears in the eleventh chapter of the first part (Sūtra-sthāna) of theCS[Caraka-saṃhitā]. Here theCSintriguingly proposes, along with the threepramāṇasone would expect (perception, inference, and authori- tative testimony), a fourth not found anywhere else: synthetic inductive reasoning (yukta-pramāṇa). Discussion ofpramāṇaoccurs in two other parts of theCS: part 3,Vimāna-sthāna, chap. 4 and chap. 8, but the uniqueyukta-pramāṇais absent from those discussions, a sign of the strati ed nature of the text.”
So a yukta pramāṇa suggest to me a possibly early date for that category.
Has anyone considered whether it is possible that the verses may have been written by Aśvaghoṣa or someone relatively early while the prose exposition may have been added by a later hand?

Dear Matthew,I was referring tomostof the elements of the list I quoted, of course, not to the entireVajrasūcī. But you areright, Matthew: theMahābhārataplays an important role in theVajrasūcī, as does…Manu – which may be the reason for Patrick’s query. It is well known that theVajrasūcīattributes several verses to Manu that cannot be traced in the extantMānavadharmaśāstra(if I remember well, this is the reason why some scholars tentatively attributed them to a lost MānavaDharmasūtra). Whatever the case may be, we might perhaps agree that theVajrasūcīis unlikely to have been composed before the 3rd-4th century CE. I am inclined to believe that it is even younger.Very best,Vincent

Subject:AW: VajrasūcīDear Patrick,As you know, Aśvaghoṣa directed some arguments against the Brahmanical understanding of the caste-classes in one of his dramas, theŚāriputraprakaraṇa/Śaradvatīputraprakaraṇa, several fragments of which have been preserved in Central Asian manuscripts and edited by Heinrich Lüders around 1910.It is thus plausible that Aśvaghoṣa dedicated an individual treatise to this topic. The style, the method and the philosophical ressources of theVajrasūcī, however, are very different from the ones we know from Aśvaghoṣa’s genuine works, and may presuppose Buddhist works such as theŚārdūlakarṇāvadānaif not Kumāralāta’sKalpanāmaṇḍitikā Dṛṣṭāntapaṅktiḥ. Even if I am not aware of any convincing argument against the attribution of theVajrasūcīto Aśvaghoṣa, I have always regarded the following statement as anachronistic:dṛśyante ca kvacic chūdrā api vedavyākaraṇamīmāṃsāsāṃkhyavaiśeṣikanagnā*jīvikādisarvaśāstrārthavidaḥ/. “And one observes in some cases that evenśūdras know the meaning of allśāstras such as the Veda, Grammar, Mīmāṃsā, Sāṃkhya, Vaiśeṣika as well as [those of] the Jainas and the Ājīvikas.” (*-nagnā-em.:lagnā-Ed.) Although such a list is notper seimpossible in Aśvaghoṣa’s time, i.e., although most of its individual elements could have been known around 100 CE, I do not believe that such an enumeration would have been possible,as a doxographic statement, at that time, and even less so underAśvaghoṣa's "pen." (The absence of the Nyāya from the list is intriguing.)Another element possibly deserving some consideration is the Sanskrit colophon in which Aśvaghoṣa is characterized assiddhācārya(kṛtir iyaṃ siddhācāryāśvaghoṣapādānām iti), an expression the exact meaning of which remains somewhat unclear to me.I am looking forward to reading other opinions on this interesting topic.Very best,Vincent

Betreff:Re: [INDOLOGY] VajrasūcīDear Patrick,
You'll find some discussion of it, inter alia, in Vincent Eltschinger,"Caste" et Philosophie BouddhiqueWSTB 47 (2000). As you no doubt know, the Chinese translation is late - 10th c. if I recall correctly - and is attributed to DharmakIrti. I rather doubt that the true authorship can be established, given the available evidence. The emphasis on pramANa seems to suggest that it was written during the second half of the first millennium, not much before. But the way in which pramANa is used there does not resonate closely with the Buddhist pramANa school. The precise milieu in which it was composed remains a puzzle (at least to me!).
