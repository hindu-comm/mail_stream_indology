I am looking for a translation of the Nyāyapraveśa — can’t find one on the internet. Does anyone know of a translation of this work and whether a pdf might be available? I need it to make sense of the 29th chapter of the Tamil Maṇimēkalai, a Buddhist work of the 6th (?) century with about 400 lines on Buddhist logic that closely resemble the NP. Thanks, George Hart
