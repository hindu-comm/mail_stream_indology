Dear scholars,
It is a known fact that any other lexicon is cited only when Amara is
silent on that word.

What I am looking for is what are the most cited lexica in commentarial
literature after Amara? 2nd, 3rd.... most popular lexica.

Is there a systematic study in this regard?
or
Some list members may share their experience from literature.

I need this information to arrange the dictionaries in descending order of
importance for display, so that most important information comes up first.
