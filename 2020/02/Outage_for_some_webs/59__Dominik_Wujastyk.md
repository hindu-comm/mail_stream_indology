Outage notice:

The website

   - http://catalogues.indology.info

is hosted on a system in the UK that is down for maintenance.  We're being
told it will be 6-7 hours before it's back, starting at 23:00 hrs UTC.  By
my reckoning that is about an hour and a half from now, so the outage may
have started a little early.

Other INDOLOGY-related websites are not affected, nor is the discussion
list.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY committee member.
