Dear Dominik and Timothy,

I wonder if in the meanwhile you have acquired/ produced a scan of the article? If so, I’d be really grateful if you could share it (with me or with the list?)

best,
Andrey

The original publisher has folded; some issues are held (owned? rights?) by the publisher Ute Hempen, although they don't sell it or answer email. Peter Das still produces issues of its successor journal, Traditional South Asian Medicine. See Peter's note about these journals.

The centre of gravity for the timely publishing of international research on the history of medicine in early India has moved to eJIM and HSSA, both of which are open-access and online.
