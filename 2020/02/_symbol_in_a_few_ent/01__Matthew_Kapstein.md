Dear Martin,

Thank you for making these useful scans available.
+ appears to be a cross-referencing device, directing one to instances in which (in this example) Agastya occurs as an author's name.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] + symbol in a few entries in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum

Dear Friends,

In ~30 entries of Afrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum a + symbol is used for example below for the entry for agastya.

http://prntscr.com/r82oxj

I was wondering if anyone on this list has worked out what this indicates as in the text itself no reference is given.

Here is a link to the scans for those without them handy:

Any insights are much appreciated!

With kindest wishes,

Martin
