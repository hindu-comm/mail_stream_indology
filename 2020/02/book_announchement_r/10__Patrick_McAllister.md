Dear colleagues,

I would like to announce a recent publication that may be of interest to
some of you:

Patrick McAllister, “Ratnakīrti’s Proof of Exclusion”, Austrian Academy
of Sciences, Vienna 2020.

>From the cover:

“The theory of universals that was developed and upheld by Buddhist
philosophers in premodern India since the sixth century CE is famous for
its central claim that any judgment of a similarity between things is
due not to anything substantially real that the things share, but to
their difference from other things (/anyāpoha/).  This book investigates
the theory as it is presented in the /Apohasiddhi/, a work written by
the Buddhist monk and teacher Ratnakīrti in the eleventh century, during
the last flowering of philosophical activity in Indian Buddhism.”

You can order the book through this link:

With best wishes,
