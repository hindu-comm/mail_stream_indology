Dear Colleagues,

My honorary Professorial Fellowship at the University of Edinburgh is 
coming to an end and will not be renewed. Consequently, my university 
e-mail address (J.L.Brockington at ed.ac.uk 
<mailto:J.L.Brockington at ed.ac.uk>) will soon be closed. Please, 
therefore, if you wish to contact me in future use my home e-mail 
address (John.Brockington at btinternet.com 
<mailto:John.Brockington at btinternet.com>). My association with Wolfson 
College, Oxford, and with the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies will continue.

Best wishes

John Brockington


Professor J. L. Brockington
