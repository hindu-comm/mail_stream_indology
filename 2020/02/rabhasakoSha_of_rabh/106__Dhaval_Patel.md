Dear scholars,
It is my pleasure to present before you the following lexicon
Rabhasakoṣa of Rabhasapāla.

As the kosha is unavailable to us, the work has been presented by using a
1963 Ph.D. thesis available at
https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/145373

Title -
The Rabhasakosa - reconstructed on the basis of quotations found in the
commentarial literature

Author -
Mahadevan, R

With regards,
--
