Dear colleagues,

I am happy to announce the publication of A Linguistic Survey of the Malayalam Language in Its Own Terms (published by Otto Harrassowitz).

I hope the book will be useful for both teachers and researchers of Malayalam language, literature, and culture.

See here for more details:

All the best,

Ophira
