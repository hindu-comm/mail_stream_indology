Just curiosity speaking. If the current Hindi term for medical masks is चिकित्सा मास्क (is that right?), and avaguṇṭhana seems to indicate a veil more than an actual mask, and a वर्णिका seems restricted to the sort of masks used by actors, does that mean there is no classical Sanskrit term for the generic sense of mask? What do various Indian languages call the masks worn by superheroes?
