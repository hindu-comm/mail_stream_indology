A distraction from the Coronavirus

स्वयंवरे वधू: काचिद् मालां क्षिप्त्वा विनिर्गता ।
“दुर्दिनेऽस्मिन् करोनाया वरयामि न कञ्चन” ।।

At the ceremony of choosing a husband, the bride threw down the garland and
went away saying: "During such a difficult time due to Coronavirus, I will
not choose anyone."
