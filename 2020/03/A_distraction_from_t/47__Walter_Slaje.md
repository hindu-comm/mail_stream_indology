> 24 carrot gold

While everyone will show understanding and keep politely silent if someone
makes minor mistakes in his first attempts at composing Sanskrit verses, it
is difficult to understand why a director in the Indic Academy and renowned
expert in Sanskrit matters would rate a verse containing *sparśatu *with
24-carat gold - if “carrot” was not intended to express clandestine sarcasm.
With how many carrots would he have scored, let’s say, *spṛśatu*?

Regards,
WS
