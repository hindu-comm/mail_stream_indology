Dear INDOLOGY members, this is a difficult and disruptive time for all of
us.  The members of the INDOLOGY committee send you our good wishes for
strength and courage during the coming weeks and months, as we all find
ways of adapting to the new demands of our situations.

Wishing you happiness and health,

ॐ सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः
सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः ।
सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु
मा कश्चिद्दुःखभाग्भवेत् ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Adheesh Sathaye,
Dominik Wujastyk,Philipp Maas, Stefan Baums,Wendy J. Phillips-Rodríguez
