Dear Harry,

thanks a lot for the reference, didn't know this one! Even the wrong 
accent is noted there already.

Well yes, mantras like these were called Gāyatrīs. The matter is a bit 
complicated though. As far as I have come to understand it, they were 
called thus because they imitate the famous Gāyatrī verse (Ṛgveda III 
62.10) or are modified versions of it. But this verse acquired the name 
“Gāyatrī” rather late (considering its own age), for the first time 
perhaps in the Taittirīya-Āraṇyaka and then also in later additions the 
Dharmasūtras (in the Mahābharata, too, the verse is called Gāyatrī 
several times, especially in the later strata).

So the point is that the modified Gāyatrīs were perhaps never actually 
thought to be in the /gāyatrī/ metre (not even by its creators, whenever 
they lived), but were only called Gāyatrī because they resemble the 
verse. I normally use /gāyatrī /for the metre and Gāyatrī for the verse 
(I did not do so in my previous email though). So the modified Gāyatrīs 
are probably not examples for metrical license, i.e., they are not 
/gāyatrī/ verses, even though they are called Gāyatrīs.

But it could very well be that some commentator explained them to be in 
the /gāyatrī/ metre, but a /gāyatrī/ metre with extra syllables etc.

Best regards,

Dominik
