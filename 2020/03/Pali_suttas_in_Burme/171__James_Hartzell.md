Hi

A colleague not on this list sent me the following question:

"I had a request from someone wanting to transliterate Pali suttas
written in the Burmese alphabet using the roman alphabet.

Do you know anyone who may be able to help with this transliteration
work, or who I might ask for help."

Any suggestions will be much appreciated

Cheers
James
