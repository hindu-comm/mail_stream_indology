Thanks a lot - kṣubhnāti is close, though there is also a morphological break of a different sort there, I suppose. And I think there are no other words in that gaṇa where we are dealing with an exception to nati within a word, it is all (except kṣubh-nā) about words that don't have nati when in compound. The gaṇa as a whole appears to be a list of inexplicable exceptions to the general rules, but there is nothing quite like Korona.

I think people adapt borrowings to the constraints of their native phonology. Pāṇini would have been able to pronounce it Korona with dental, but if the rules of Sanskrit do not allow exceptions to nati in monomorphemic stems, and only rarely in morphologically complex stems, Korona would be alien to the natural rules of Sanskrit. But perhaps with such an awful thing it's better to keep it alien!

Are there any examples of post-Pāṇinian borrowings into Sanskrit, preferably unsegmentable nominal stems, where nati was not applied according to the regular rules?

Best wishes,
John

I don't know what Pāṇini would have done, koroṇā/koronā, masculine or feminine.  There are exceptions to the retroflexion rules even in single words  [as क्षुभ्नादिषु च ८।४।३९. न इति वर्तते। क्षुभ्ना इत्येवम् आदिषु शब्देषु नकारस्य णकारदेशो न भवति। क्षुभ्नाति।].  In any case, importing an expression from a modern language into Sanskrit, one represents it as one hears it around.  Around me here in San Jose, I don't hear the retroflex.  But either representation is fine with me.  In early Marathi writings, the name of Mountstuart Elphinstone was written as मौन्त स्त्युवर्त एलफिन्स्तन.  In more recent Marathi writings, I see मौंट स्टुअर्ट एलफिन्स्टन, and the more Apabhramsha version was known as इष्टुर फाकडा. I write कॅलिफोर्निया.  No retroflexion there.

That is, writing Sanskrit - not Hindi -  we should prefer the spelling
कोरोणा. With the nirukti kora-ūna this would denote something even less
or smaller than a bud, no?

Regarding Bhāmaha, most of us would still prefer a grammatical error to
a virus infection, I guess:

एकः प्रतिदिनं श्लोकः कोरोणां हि निवारयेत् ।
सुप्तिङन्तादिदोषे ऽपि शोधनीये ऽप्रयासतः ।
इत्युक्तमवरुद्धेन स्वगृहे कविमेदिना ॥

"A stanza a day keeps the virus away --
even if there may be a grammatical error, which can easily be
corrected."
This was said by a friend of the kavis secluded in his own house.

Just my two (and a half) cents.
Best,
