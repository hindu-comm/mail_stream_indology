Dear list members,

I have put together a brief survey about the use of digital tools and
resources (broadly defined) in South Asian studies (also broadly defined):

https://forms.gle/4e7MToRciYCqV2Rg7

I hope that a few of you will find the time to respond to it. Of course

free to contact me off-list with any further thoughts or questions about it.

Andrew
