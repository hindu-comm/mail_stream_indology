"You get along with Henry?
"Oh, sure thing," said Bunny, reared back in his chair. "We were roommates. Freshman year."
"And you like him?"
"Certainly, certainly. He's a hard fellow to live with though. Hates noise, hates company, hates mess. None of this brining your date back to the room to listen to a couple Art Pepper records, if you know what I'm trying to get at.""I think he's sort of rude."
Buddy shrugged. "That's his way. See, his mind doesn't work the same way yours and mine do. He's always up in the clouds with Plato or something. Works too hard, takes himself too seriously, studying Sanskrit and Coptic and those other nutty languages. Henry, I tell him, if you're going to waste your time learning something besides Greek -- that and the King's English are all I think a man needs, personally -- why don't you buy yourself some Berlitz records and brush up on your French. Find a little can-can girl or something. Voolay-voo coushay avec moi and all that."
"How many languages does he know?"
"I lost count. Seven or eight. He can read hieroglyphics."
"Wow."Bunny shook his head fondly. "He's a genius, that boy. He could be a translator for the UN if he wanted to be."
"Where's he from?"
"Missouri."

p. 356 also has a [not historically great] description of Buddhist Tantra.

"In "Spamalot," of course, the horseplay's the thing. And in a world of juvenile antics, a gift for Shakespearean tragedy would seem to be about as useful as a doctorate in Sanskrit."

Speaking of my dear friend Lee Siegel: he often tells the story that he only decided to study Sanskrit after hearing a speech of Richard Nixon the California senator (before he became president), in which the latter quipped that the University of California's budget should be slashed because 'instead of doing anything useful, they are studying things like Sanskrit'.

One of my favorites, although I am having difficulty finding the source, is: "A knowledge of Sanskrit is of little use to a man trapped in a sewer." The internet tells me that this is attributed to Tom Weller, but I suspect that he got it from someone else.Greetings from the sewer.

“To study Sanskrit” (учить Санскрит) became a rather popular idiom (a kind of meme) in Russia in 2015, and it has been used since thenfrequentlyexactly as an epitome of a useless time-consuming and exhausting activity, which, in a long run,may bestill more rewarding than engaging in Russian politics (especially as a member of the opposition). It was popularized by journalistOleg Kashin, who has famously used this expression (the original wording was actually slightly different) in his debate with politician Alexey Navalny, who, in 2015, campaigned for opposition parties to participate at regional elections at any cost. See, for example, here or here. The original debate is here.

Dear All!
One may also add a passage of Hermann Hesse's "Glasperlenspiel" here, though also rather in the category of useful uselessness:
… schon manche von ihnen haben ihr Leben an sehr entlegene und oft wunderliche Arbeiten gewendet, wie etwa jener Lodovicus crudelis, der in dreißigjähriger Arbeit alle überlieferten altägyptischen Texte sowohl ins Griechiche wie ins Sanskrit übersetzt hat …
… not few of them devoted their lives to very marginal and often rather strange occupations, like one Lodovicus crudelis, who in the course of thirty years translated all preserved Old Egyptian texts both into Greek and into Sanskrit …

Sort of related, on page 100 of chapter 5, ofAmazing Stories (1943) issue 17 no 05,the following is said:She put her hands on her hips, her  
face thoughtful. Then she grabbed hold  
of the grab-rail on the side of the door-  
way, stepped into the bipedomobile.  
She wasn’t a tall girl, but she had to  
stoop.  

Her eyes were grave. Suddenly she  
pointed into the distance.  

“Godwa te lele!”  

“It’s all Sanskrit to me, Jamie,” he

to go in that direction, okay. It’s as  
good as any, and maybe we’ll solve a  
few mysteries while we’re at it. We  
might even find out how to get your  
memory back again.”  

She smiled dazzlingly. She pointed

This reminds me that one of my teachers, the great Prof. Padmanabh Jaini, lost several students in the late 70s because the job market seemed particularly bad. They switched to law and easily passed the special examinations, the "Law Boards," for entering American Law Schools. Jaini joked that the field could be saved and even expanded by converting Sanskrit to a pre-law required course.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] The study of Sanskrit as the epitome of uselessnessThe Classicist Nuccio Ordine has published a stimulating (useful) essay "De l'utilité de l'inutile" (English translation: The Usefulness of the Useless").where Sanskrit studies, together with Classics, are given as an example of (useful) usefulness, cf. p. 95 of the Engl. Transl.:https://books.google.com/books?id=NCArDgAAQBAJSee also it in his oral presentations:https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/incal/conference-du-pr-nuccio-ordine.htmlQuel danger courons-nous actuellement ? Dans une université-entreprise, quand un professeur de sanskrit aura deux étudiants, le Conseil d’administration de l’Université pourra dire que celle-ci ne peut pas se permettre le luxe de payer un professeur de sanskrit pour deux étudiants. Demain, cela sera pour dix étudiants en grec, et après-demain pour quinze étudiants en latin.

Dear List members,Last night I started reading Ever After by Graham Swift. On p. 3 of the pocket edition (Vintage International) of 1993 we hear the protagonist think:
"Before they [academics] are sixty, they are emulating one of the many varieties: ... the wide-eyed,latter-day infant, helpless in all mundane matters but possessed of a profound understanding of Sanskrit."
A few months ago I was reading Nader tot U (1969) by Gerard van 't Reve gain. One of the characters has to fill in a profession on an official paper. In the end he decides to fill in "indoloog", which is considered to be better than "general in theHungarian army"or "stratenmaker of zee" (general dogsbody) (p. 113). There is some confusion if indoloog refers to a civil servant in the Dutch Indies here (Indie verloren, rampspoed geboren) or to an indologist, which is later resolved by remarks about gurus and bhakti. I was amazed to see that I had bought the book in the summer of1970, just a fewmonths before I started with the study of Sanskrit.
Are there more accidental references of this type to sanskritists or indologists in literature?(Leaving aside Lee Siegel's novel about Professor Roth being killed by Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary.)
