Višnja Grabovac gave an interesting talk connected to this topic at last
year's International Vedic Workshop: "Notes on Indra or Śakra in
Buddhist texts" 

Here's the abstract from the Programme
(http://www.iuc.hr/IucAdmin/Server/downloads/7IVWProgrammeandAbstracts.pdf):


"Indra, one of the most prominent Vedic deities, is found in Buddhist
texts as well. Commonly known as Sakka in Pāli and Śakra in Sanskrit
Buddhist texts, this deity exhibits some different qualities than ones
attributed to him in Vedic or later Brahmanical texts, though there are
other features that clearly connect Indra and Buddhist Sakka/ Śakra. On
the whole, the role of Indra or Śakra in Buddhism bears witness to the
stage in the history of Hinduism in which new cults of Viṣṇu and Śiva
did not as yet overshadow the cult of Indra, just as is the case in the
older layers of the Sanskrit epics too, and it is still a form of the
Vedic religion that Buddhism is addressing as its counterpart. With the
focus on the mahāvastu, a work preserved in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and
belonging to Lokottaravāda subsect of the mahāsāṅghikas, the intention
of the paper will be to present the role of Śakra in the biographical
episodes of gautama Buddha and contained jātakas, to isolate his
epithets, and to highlight some instances which complicate the
understanding of the relationship between Indra and Śakra in the
mahāvastu." 

Best, 

D. Haas

> The trend seems to be, according to those sources, a domestication of Sakka from the fearsome Indra, slayer of the dragon Vṛtra in the Ṛg Veda, to a docile devotee of the Buddha. However, Buddhaghosa identified Sakka with Vajrapāṇi, the fearsome protector of the Dharma, who pummels those who threaten or bad-mouth the Dharma. So apparently even as late as Buddhaghosa's day (ca. 5th c CE), the 'terrible' form of Indra was still resonant with how Buddhists viewed Sakka/Śakra.

>> the Sambulā-Jātaka (519) is illustrated at a monastery Sri Lanka. Sambulā takes care of her leprosy husband Sotthisena in the forest. A demon falls in love and tries to catch her but Śakra rescues her.  The corresponding mural depicts Śakra as a terrible being holding a club in his hands. The Pali Jātaka provides no description of a disguised Śakra but in the Sinhalese Sambulā-Jātaka we can read, that Śakra saves Sambulā in the disguise of a terrible being (..._Sakdevraja bhayānaka vēṣayak geṇa_ ...). I suppose this is recorded in a source of the Mūlasarvāstivāda-Vinaya tradition, written in Sanskrit or Tibetan.
