I have written the following on this topic in the joint paper by Asko Parpola & Juha Janhunen, “On the Asiatic Wild Asses and Their Vernacular Names”, pp. 59-124 in: Toshiki Osada & Hitoshi Endo (eds.), Linguistics, Archaeology and the Human Part: Occasional Paper 12, Kyoto: Indus Project, Research Institute for Humanity and Nature, 2011; reprinted, pp. 59-124 in: Toshiki Osada & Hitoshi Endo (eds.), Current Studies on the Indus Civilization, vol. IX, New Delhi: Manohar, 2012.

Page 111, note 94. Another reason is Balarāma’s great strength (bala-). The stem of the palmyra palm is hard as stone, and the Buddha as a young prince alone among several contestants was able to pierce seven palmyra palms that stood in a row with a single arrow (cf. Mahāvastu 2 p. 75-76 & Lalitavistara 2, p. 155; this episode of the Buddha's life is depicted both in cave 16 at Ajaṇṭā and in Borobuḍur, and the trees depicted are clearly palmyra palms). In Rāmāyaṇa 4,11,47 - 4,12,9, Rāma performs the same feat. Many manuscripts here have tāla instead of sāla in the critical edition and Lefeber's translation (cf. Lefeber 1994: 77-78 and 224-226; sāla is Shorea robusta). It is undoubtedly for such a reason that also Bhīṣma (cf. Mahābhārata 6,44,48) and Kṛṣṇa (Mahābhārata 16,4,5) are said to have the palmyra palm as the emblem on their banner. (See Syed 1990: 311-314 and 323-324 with Abb. 14.6-7.) 

With best wishes, Asko

I'm more or less aware of all that the lexicographers have to say on the matter (śāla is prescribed by Maheśvara but commentators on the Amarakośa 2.4.know both sāla and śāla, etc.). I am working on a passage where more or the less the same variants are available as in R 4.12 and was intrigued by the fact that Ñ1, our oldest dated witness (Samvat 1076/1020 CE) has tāla throughout. Other Devanāgarī MSS and the Śārada MS share it as well, so it seems that it was intentional and not just a confusion of सा/ता.

Although most great poets have used forms that have been subject to criticism and endless debate (this is especially true of Kālidāsa but even Māgha's famed verse on the bells [4.20] drives grammarians mad), it is best for beginners to stick with well-attested grammatical forms and avoid those found in the Epics. Epic forms are of course not wrong, but my impression is that we, as non-ṛṣis, have not business using them and poems containing them would be readily dismissed especially at the beginning stages of composition.  One of the benefits of presenting poetry or other work to the sabhā is to receive feedback for improvement. This has always been the case. Yet criticism and erudition can come in many forms. I always think of Pt. Añjaneya Śarma's response to my question about the meaning of "fragrant gold" (to paraphrase): any paṇḍit is of course gold, but a kind paṇḍit is fragrant gold.
