Esteemed scholars, 

For a project I’m in need of the following article by the late Prof. Hahn: 

Michael Hahn. “Kṣemendra’s Garbhāvakrāntyavadāna (Sanskrittexte aus dem tibetischen Tanjur II)," Journal of the European Ayurvedic Society 5 (1997): 82-112. 

Due to the present circumstances I do not have physical access to a university library, and my internet research did not lead me to an electronic version of this discontinued journal. I would be grateful if someone was able to share a PDF copy of this article with me.

Many thanks! 

Bruno
