Dear Jean-Luc,
This is as fascinating as it is puzzling.
Have the translations of (parts of) the Tolkāppiyam by K. Zvelebil ever been published?
See his announcement of a translation in his The Smile Of Murugan, Leiden, 1973, p. 131.
Stay healthy and well in Müssen,
Jan

P.S.
for the children in Müssen, during the corona-crisis:

म्युस्सनित्यत्र किं कुर्यात्   हसनं न तु चुम्बनम् ।

This one I will translate, freely, into German:
"Was kann man machen in Müssen?
Nur lachen, nicht küssen."

P.P.S.
Did anyone ever try to transcribe into Sanskrit -- into Devanagari -- the German "ü" or French "u" or Dutch "uu"?
Max Müller sanskritized his name simply as मोक्ष मूलर according to my teacher Prof. Henk Bodewitz in order to suggest to his Indian readers that he can bring them liberation, but in that way M.M. skipped the problem of the transcription of this phoneme that is absent in Sanskrit and in Hindi and in most other Indian languages I know of (but a similar sound is there in Tibetan, if I'm not mistaken).
