A distraction from the Coronavirus

केशैर्विहीनानि शिरांसि येषाम्
किं नापितै: कार्यमिहास्ति तेषाम् ।
न स्पर्शभीतिर्न धनव्ययो वा
खल्वाटवन्त: खलु भाग्यवन्त: ।।

Those who have no hair on their heads, what purpose do they have with
barbars. They have no fear of contracting the Coronavirus, nor any
expenditures. The bald people are really fortunate.
