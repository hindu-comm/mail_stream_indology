This is wonderful! Here’s another one:

पत्त्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति ।
तदहं भक्त्युपहृतमश्नामि कोरोनामुक्तः ॥

Who offers to me with devotion,
A leaf, a flower, fruit, or water.
I accept that, offered with devotion,
>From one who is free from the Coronavirus.

(based on Bhagavad Gītā 9.26)

Best wishes,
Zoë
