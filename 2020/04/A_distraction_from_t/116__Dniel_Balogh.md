Perhaps a little bit sensitive, but I hear the Ganga is much cleaner now.

यस्मिञ्छुद्धमिति प्रसस्नुरुरगाः प्राग्देवमर्त्यास्तथा
यच्चाद्यातनलोकजाड्यवशगं तुल्यं विषेणाभवत्।
संस्तब्धेषु विषाणुना तदधुना विद्वत्सु मूर्खेषु च
चित्रं पश्य सुरापगे परिगतं पेयत्वमम्भस्तव॥

In which serpents, gods and mortals once bathed saying “It is pure!”—
Which has become like poison, helpless against the dumbness of today’s
people—
Now that dumb and wise alike are restrained by a virus,
Look and wonder, Divine River: that water of yours has turned fit to drink.
