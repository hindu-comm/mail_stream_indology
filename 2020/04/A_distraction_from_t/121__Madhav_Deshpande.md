A distraction from the Coronavirus

शिरांसि येषां जटिलानि केशै:
किं नापितै: कार्यमिहास्ति तेषाम् ।
न स्पर्शभीतिर्न धनव्ययो वा
जटाधरास्ते खलु भाग्यवन्त: ।।

Those who have matted hair on their heads, what purpose do they have with
barbers? They have no fear of contracting the Coronavirus, nor any
expenditures. The people with matted hair are really fortunate.
