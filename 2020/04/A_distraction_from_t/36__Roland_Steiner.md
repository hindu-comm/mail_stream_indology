Dear Madhav,

I am aware of this, but there is also evidence in non-epic and  
non-puranic works, for example

Kṣemendra's /Darpadalana /(7.30):

/°śoṇaprabhārdrāv iva pādapadmau/

Or, Somadeva's /Kathāsaritsāgara /(5.2.229):

/ubhau kalaśapadmau ca śuśubhate sitāruṇau/

Or, /Mokṣopāya /5.65.29 (= "/Yogavāsiṣṭha/")

/padmāv iva jaloddhṛtau/

Perhaps it is no coincidence that these examples all come from texts  
that originated in Kashmir.

With best regards,
Roland
