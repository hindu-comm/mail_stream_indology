Dear Roland,

     Your observation that many of these masculine usages for *padma* come
from Kashmir is interesting. I have no idea of how gender works in Kashmiri
and particularly in old Kashmiri.  Just looking at Hindi, the three
gendered words of Sanskrit get redistributed to two genders.  While Marathi
has three genders like Sanskrit, the genders of words often change in
Marathi.  Words like *svapna *and *vighna *that are masculine in Sanskrit
become neuter in Marathi.  The Marathi users of Sanskrit will instinctively
use these words in neuter, till they are corrected by a learned pandit.
मेरी आत्मा of Hindi has always shocked me as a Marathi speaker.
