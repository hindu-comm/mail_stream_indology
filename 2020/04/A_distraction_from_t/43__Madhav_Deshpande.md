Professor Jha's citation from Mammaṭa's Kāvyaprakāśa calling the usage *bhāti
padmaḥ sarovare *was also on my mind.  Clearly, he knew that some poets
used *padma *in masculine, but considered it to be a *doṣa.  *If we
discount Mammaṭa's value judgment, his statement probably means something
like this: the neuter usage of *padma* is the mainstream usage, while the
masculine usage is marginal.  This is something like
Kiparsky's interpretation of Pāṇini's term *vibhāṣā* referring to marginal
usages.  On the other hand, the Amarakośa says: *vā puṃsi padmam nalinam *etc.
indicating that Amara knew the alternating genders and didn't see any
problem.  So we have Mammaṭa on one side and Amara on the other side.  An
interesting situation indeed.  नैको मुनिर्यस्य वच: प्रमाणम्?
