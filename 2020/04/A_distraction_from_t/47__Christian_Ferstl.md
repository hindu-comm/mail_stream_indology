Übung macht den Meister - so let my try again:

मानवरोगसंचारवर्जनार्थं स बुद्धिमान् ।
रामो लाङ्गूलिनं ह्येव किं नु लङ्कामचारयत् ॥

Did Rama the wise send none other than a monkey to Lanka
in order to avoid transmission of a human disease?

(Please note that I do not consider myself a paṇḍit or a kavi but rather 
a humble student of Sanskrit language and literature. I very much 
appreciate your patience with my sometimes faulty compositions as well 
as your improvements and the interesting discussions triggered by them.)
