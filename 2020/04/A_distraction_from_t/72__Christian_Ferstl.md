Lockdown in Lanka:

कुशेन पृष्टं किमकारि बद्धो
गृहे विषाणोः स तु कुम्भकर्णः ।
ततो लवस्तं प्रहसन्नवोचच्
चखाद सुष्वाप महोदरो ऽभूत् ॥

Kusha asked: “What did Kumbhakarna do when he was captured in his house 
due to the virus?”
Thereupon Lava said to him laughing: “He ate, slept, and had his belly 
grow.”


Happy Easter!
Christian Ferstl
