Thank you to Harry for posting a scan of S. K. Chatterji's 1960 article on
"The Pronunciation of Sanskrit" from *Indian Linguistics*. I see that part
of the print is not always readable on the left side of the left pages in
the scans. I attach a scan of it that I made a couple years ago at Cornell
University Library Annex. My scan does show all the print, but otherwise is
not better. By then, Cornell had done away with photocopy machines where
one could lay the page flat on the glass, and had only scanners where one
had to lay the book down open and hope it laid fairly flat. It usually does
not lay flat, and the pages come out somewhat wavy in the scans. Sorry,
this is the best I could do.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
