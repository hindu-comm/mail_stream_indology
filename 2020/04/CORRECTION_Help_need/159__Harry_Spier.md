Thank you to those who replied off-list.  I've received two very different
views of the meaning of

 jāgrat-kūrma-samśritā in the verse which I've summarized below.


VIEW 1


     The Bhagavadgītā uses the example of Kūrma for a state of the complete
withdrawal of the senses:


*yadā saṃharate cāyaṃ kūrmo' ṅgānīva sarvaśaḥ /*

*indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā // 2.58//*


     Such a state would contrast with the state referred to by the word
*jāgrat*.  Thus, it seems refer to the state of focusing inward.  I am not
quite sure if you would call it sleep, or more likely a conscious
concentration that directs awareness inwards.


Perhaps it means "she who abides in both the waking state and the state of
complete withdrawal of senses."

VIEW 2

I think that kūrma here refers to the microcosmic equivalent of the
tortoise that supports the world. I don’t know of any clear references to
this idea in texts, but one often sees Kuṇḍalinī supported by a tortoise in
“cakra scrolls” from the 17th century onwards. See the attached image for
an example.

That still leaves jāgrat, which seems odd here. One would want it to
contrast with nidritā, i.e. to make a distinction between Kuṇḍalinī when
asleep and awake, but that would require jāgratī. So I think one has to
understand the compound as meaning “situated on a waking
