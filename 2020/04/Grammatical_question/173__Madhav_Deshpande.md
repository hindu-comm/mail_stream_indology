Dear George,

     As per Pāṇini's rules, a word-final *m* changes to *anusvāra *before
any consonant [*mo 'nusvāraḥ, hali*].  Then come option rules.  Before
*y/v/l*, an *anusvāra *can optionally change to nasal versions of *y/v/l*.
Before the stops, it can optionally change to a nasal homogeneous with
the following stop [*parasavarṇa*].  This leaves *r/ś/ṣ/s/h*, and before
these it remains *anusvāra*.  In some Vedic traditions, in this last
environment, it becomes *nāsikya *or *raṅga*.  Then there are rules which
change *n* into an *anusvāra *in some environments.  This is the general
description according to Pāṇini.  Some other grammars do allow an *m
*occurring at
the end of an occurrence before a pause to change into *anusvāra*,
reflecting some local variation.  Of course, the actual pronunciation
of an *anusvāra
*probably differed regionally as we notice today, and different Vedic
traditions have conventionally settled ways of its pronunciation.  Also
rules that are optional in Pāṇini don't necessarily remain optional in
various Vedic tradition.  In most Vedic recitations I have heard, the
change of an *anusvāra *into a *parasavarṇa *nasal is almost done
invariably.
