Dear Harsha,

     Thank you for your appreciation of my Krishna poems.  Here is a verse
in reference to your English verse:

गोकुले परिनृत्यन्ती यस्य माया सुखप्रदा ।
तं भजे मायिनं कृष्णं द्वैताद्वैतविवर्जितम् ।।

I devote to Krishna, the magician, whose magic dancing around Gokula
provides joy.  He is beyond the conceptions of duality and non-duality.

Madhav
