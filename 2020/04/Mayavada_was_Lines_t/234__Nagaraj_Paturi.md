His Telugu commentary to Vivekachudamani is the context. Whether to give
the references from works that are acceptedly those of Sankara in that
context is justified or not is a different point.

The focus here is on Sankar's interpretations of Maayaa, Hartmut
Buescher-ji.

Thanks and regards,

Nagaraj
