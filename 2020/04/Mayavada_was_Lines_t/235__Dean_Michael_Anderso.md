Not doubting your assertion -- this is not my area of expertise -- but could you please point me to some discussions about which texts are considered to be from which Shankara, so to say?
Best,
Dean

Betterhesitate, investigate and be careful with your reply.

PS: Not tospeak of contemporary, trans-national scholarship, but has your 

respected fathernot been acquainted with (or perhaps rejected) the research 

of ŚrīSaccidānandendrasarasvatī of Holenarsipur?

--- Not to contradict the view "Śaṅkara has no specific theory ofmāyā" , but just to remember occasions where he gives meaning of the word, resorting to his favourite etymological approach, picking up from my father (Sitaramanjaneyulu Paturi)'s notes to his Telugu commentary on Viveka Chudamani,
अक्षरः - भगवन्मायाशक्तिः - क्षराख्यस्य ( वैराजस्य ) पुरुषस्य उत्पत्तिबीजम् - अनेक्संसारिजन्तुकामकर्मादिसंस्काराश्रयः ( गीताभाष्य -15 अध्यायः )
मायाभिः - इंद्रियप्रज्ञाभिः - अविद्यारूपाभिः ( भाष्य गौडपादकारिका - अद्वैतप्रकरण कारिका 2)
He seems to have taken माङ् - माने as the dhaatu for माया . In words such as निर्माण it has meanings related toउत्पत्तिबीजम् ,कर्मादि . as in गीताभाष्य above.
In words such as प्रमाण, it has meanings related toप्रज्ञा ,विद्या as in गौडपादकारिकाभाष्य above.

SeeHacker’s short but illuminating remarks in his groundbreaking “Eigentümlichkeiten der Lehre und Terminologie Śaṅkaras: Avidyā, Nāmarūpa, Māyā, Īśvara” (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft100, 1950, 246-286), pp. 268 ff.

Betreff: Re: [INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)Dear Dean, 
The term was used first, for all we know, by Bhaskara, in a pejorative sense. Hajime Nakamura’s first volume of his History of Early Vedanta Philosophy is a good source on this.
Best wishes,Aleksandar

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Mayavada (was Lines to an Advaitin)I notice that this post uses the term 'mayavada' in referring to Advaitins. This is appropriate in this context I suppose because it is offering an alternative perspective to Advaita.
But some of the Advaitins I have spoken to say that that is a term coined by their opponents and that it is inaccurate, even if it has been adopted by some ill-informed Advaitins to refer to themselves and become part of the popular speech. These Advaitins say that the emphasis should be on 'avidya' or 'mithya' rather than 'maya'.

I wonder if anyone has any comments about this or could point me to some publications that discuss it.
Note: I am interested in the scholarly discussion of these terms and the associated concepts, not in a discussion about which is the supreme realization. :-)

Best,
Dean

Friends:Inspired by Madhav Deshpande and with a long history of my polite confrontations with Advaitins I propose to write 100 lines.I am a staunch Krishna rasika. Writing in English deprives my lines of the majesty of Sanskrit. However what English lacks in the melody and rhythms of Sanskrit it will hopefully make up in its rasa.Wait O! Advaitin, before I accept your mayavadaLet me tarry a bit and enjoy the lotus face of Krishna.Kind regards,HarshaProf. Harsha V. Dehejia
