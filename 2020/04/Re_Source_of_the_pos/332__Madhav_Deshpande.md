To me, it is clear that there is no direct link between the Sanskrit
instrumental -ena and Modern Marathi forms like देवाने.  Old Marathi has
देवें, and at some point -ने in singular and -नी in plural emerge.  It is
unlikely that Marathi would be reverting directly to Sanskrit in this late
phase.  The old Marathi inscription has चामुंडरायें करवियले, where Modern
Marathi would have चामुंडरायाने करविले.  G. V. Tulpule in his यादवकालीन
मराठी भाषा provides many forms that have a similar ending, i.e गंगराजें,
दंडनाकें, सावंतें etc. and the plural forms like गुरवीं, पंडितीँ,
म्हाइंभटीं etc.  The endings that appear in Modern Marathi are not there in
the Marathi of the Yadava period.  But ज्ञानेश्वरी has a few forms like
तेणे and जेणे and देवाचेनि, indicating that the endings ने/नि do exist at
least marginally in Old Marathi.  Some have connected this to the influence
of Kannada in the neighborhood.  However, the endings -ने/नी are to be seen
in the Marathi of the Peshwa period and then they continue into Modern
Marathi.
