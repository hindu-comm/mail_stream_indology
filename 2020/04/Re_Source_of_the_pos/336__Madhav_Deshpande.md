Thanks, Dick, for these references.  Kellogg's observation goes in line
with mine that the ने/नी begin to appear in Marathi largely during the
Shivaji-Peshwa period.  However, an occasional use of the forms जेणे/तेणे
is seen in Jñāneśvarī.  In his famous Pasāyadāna, Jñāneśvara uses तेणें
वरें ज्ञानदेवो सुखिया झाला, where the form तेणें coordinates with वरें, the
latter being the more standard form for the period.  Best,

Madhav
