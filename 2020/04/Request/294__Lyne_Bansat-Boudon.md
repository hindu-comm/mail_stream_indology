Dear colleagues,

I have received several answers to my request, including the book by Agrawala— a request which was, to my mind, like throwing a bottle into the sea!
My gratitude goes to David Reigle, Robert Leach, Evgenia Desnitskaya, Raffaele Torella and Brian Campbell, who came to my rescue.
This wonderful list is indeed a kalpavr̥kṣa!
All thanks again. It is a solace in such a dark period to experience that sort of disinterested confraternity.

Best wishes,

Lyne
