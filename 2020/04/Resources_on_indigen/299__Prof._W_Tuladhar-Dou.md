Dear David,

Do you mean names for plants in Indigenous languages of Bangladesh, or just general information on the flora of Bangladesh? There are numerous sources in English and Bengali for the latter, ranging from entries in the Banglopedia through Pasha and Uddin's _Dictionary of Plant Names of Bangladesh_, to the Flora of Bangladesh in many volumes.

The former is a somewhat more challenging question, but some of Shaikh Bokhtear Uddin's publications can help and depending on the community there is plenty of scholarship around lexicons, traditional medicine and so forth carried out by Indigenous scholars.

Be well,

â€”WBTD.
