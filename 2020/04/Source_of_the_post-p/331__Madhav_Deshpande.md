Dear Indologists,

     What is the historical source for the post-position ने in Hindi and
ने/नी  in Marathi?  I see some folks connect this directly with the
instrumental ending -एन, as in फलेन.  At least in Marathi, I noticed Jules
Bloch saying this this -एन simply becomes एं, as in देवें केले in Old
Marathi.  But then what is the source of देवाने/देवांनी  in Modern Marathi
and ने in राम ने?  Any suggestions?
