Dear Friends
It is with inconsolable grief that I write to inform you that my dear
friend and close colleague Stefano Zacchetti, Professor at the University
of Oxford, passed away yesterday.
An appropriate homage and remembrance will appear in due course. I find
myself simply unable to write more now.
