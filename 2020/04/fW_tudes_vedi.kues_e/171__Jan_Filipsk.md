Dear All,

The generosity and efforts of all concerned are marvellous and deserve the utmost admiration of all including a nit-picking nobody like my humble self.

Unfortunately, under Tome 4 one can find Tome VI (the same file as under Tome 6), but the proper Tome IV (Les hymnes to Viśvedevāḥ) is missing. I have the correct file at my disposal and am willing to share it, but 7,6 MB is probably too large to attach. 

Technically, I am not sure how to upload it to the Archive.org. Any help?

Best regards,

Jan Filipsky, Prague

Through the effort and generosity of colleagues, we now have all 17 vols of Renou's journal, 1955-1969.  They are available at the Archive.org, at

Best wishes and thanks again to the contributors (I did nothing).



Dominik
