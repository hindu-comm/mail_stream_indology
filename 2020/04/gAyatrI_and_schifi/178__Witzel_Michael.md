Dear All,
We have been talking about the Gāyatrī a lot.

As it is the weekend, for your amusement:

The Scifi TV channel is streaming (free) all 50+ episodes of their old "Battleship Galactica" series now:
 (https://www.syfy.com/battlestargalactica)

Did anyone notice that the theme song of each episode is the Gāyatrī:
"oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ svāhā(!).  Tat savitur … pracodayāt"

Cheers!
Michael
