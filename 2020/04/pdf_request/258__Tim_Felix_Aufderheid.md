Dear all,

does anybody have a pdf of the following two articles and would be 
willing to share them?

(1) Cardona, George. "/Anvaya/ and /Vyatireka/ in Indian Grammar." 
/Adyar Library Bulletin/ 31--32 (1967--1968): 313--52.

(2) Joshi, S. D. "/Adjectives and substantives/ as a /single class/ in 
the 'parts of speech'." PCASS-A 9. (1966).

Thanks in advance and best regards

Tim
