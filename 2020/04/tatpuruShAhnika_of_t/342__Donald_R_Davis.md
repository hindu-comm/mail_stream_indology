Dear Colleagues,

Could any of the wizards of online repositories of texts point me to the translation of Tatpuruṣāhnika of the Mahābhāṣya by Joshi and Roodbergen? I believe it is vol. 4 in their series through Poona. I see other volumes on archive.org, but cannot find this one. I would like to consult 2.2.6 specifically, in case the full text is not online.

Thanks in advance,
