Through the effort and generosity of colleagues, we now have all 17 vols of
Renou's journal, 1955-1969.  They are available at the Archive.org, at

   - https://n2t.net/ark:/13960/t3d01wt5n

The previews will appear in the next few hours.

Best wishes and thanks again to the contributors (I did nothing).
