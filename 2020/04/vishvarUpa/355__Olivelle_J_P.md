I have transcribed in searchable format Viśvarūpa’s commentary Bālakrīḍā (9th century) on the Yājñavalkya Smṛti. It is available to view here as a Google document, under Sanskrit:

https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/southasia/language-program/languages.php

As I mentioned earlier, the commentary on Yājñavalkya by Vijñāneśvara called Mitākṣarā (12th century) is also available at the same site.

If you find any typos or errors, please do let us know and we will correct the files.

With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick
