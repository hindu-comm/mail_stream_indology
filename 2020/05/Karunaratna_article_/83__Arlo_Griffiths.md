Dear colleagues,

Would anyone be able to furnish a pdf of the article by Karunaratne on the Astamangala that appeared in volume 15 (1971), pp. 48-75, of the Journal of the Ceylonese Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (the only volume not available on JSTOR)?

Many thanks, on behalf of my Jakarta-based colleague VÃ©ronique Degroot,

Arlo Griffiths
