Dear friends,

Is anybody familiar with the lead cubes in the attached picture? These were
intriguingly found in the Thames River recently. The story from a local
periodical is here:
https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/mystery-60-peculiar-cubes-inscriptions-18232422

I imagine these were deposited in the river rather recently, but maybe
someone knows more. Iâ€™m curious what the ritual surrounding depositing such
items in a body of water might be.

All my best,
Charles
