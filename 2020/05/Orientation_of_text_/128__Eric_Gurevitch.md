There is also a useful discussion of both Tibetan xylographs and Colonial
lithographs vis-a-vis pothī and codex formatting in the following chapter,
which also cites Rocher and Rocher's *Making of Western Indology*, p. 74:

Formigatti, Camillo A. 2016. “A Forgotten Chapter in South Asian Book
History? A Bird’s Eye View of Sanskrit Print Culture.” In *Tibetan
Printing: Comparison, Continuities, and Change*, edited by Hildegard
Diemberger, Franz-Karl Ehrhard, and Peter Kornicki, 72–134.

All the best,
Eric
