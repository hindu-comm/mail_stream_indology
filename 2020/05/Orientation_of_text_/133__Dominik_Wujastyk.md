In the early history of printing in India, especially Bombay, lithograph
printing was commonly done this way, with the text in landscape format.
This was a direct transfer of the look-and-feel of the tradition manuscript
over to the new technology of reproduction.

There's a substantial collection (nearly 200?) of early Indian lithographs
in the Wellcome Library in London.  I don't quickly know how to sub-select
them in the OPAC, but here is a link to some of them.

The Wellcome Sanskrit and Hindi lithographs were catalogued long ago by
Somdev Vasudev.
