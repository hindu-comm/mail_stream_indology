Dear Harry,

> 1) If any members have the *tāntrikābhidanakośa*, can they tell me if the
> word *saṁkita* occurs in it. And if so can they scan the page for me.

To my knowledge, only three of five planned volumes have been  
published so far. The third volume comprises the words beginning with  
the letters /ṭ-ph/.

You can use the NWS ("Nachtragswörterbuch des Sanskrit"; a cumulative  
supplemental dictionary of Sanskrit) to find out whether a particular  
term is listed in TAK I-III.

Example:
https://nws.uzi.uni-halle.de/search?lang=en&utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=taTAkapratiSThA&m=&t=&d=&type=&ntype=&cat=&ncat=&c=&v=&merge=on

Description of the NWS:
https://nws.uzi.uni-halle.de/description?lang=en

Best wishes,
Roland Steiner
