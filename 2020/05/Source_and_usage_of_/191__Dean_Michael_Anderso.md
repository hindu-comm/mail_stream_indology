 Hi Harry,
I've heard it many times in temples across India. 

I have tried to find the source but failed. Some say it is from Guru Gita or even Yajur Veda(!) but I checked two versions of Guru Gita and didn't see it. Yajur Veda is so unlikely I didn't look.
Best,
Dean

 Dear list members,I've been asked to find the source of the following verses and also to enquire if anyone knows of any pujas or temple ceremonies these are used in.

karpūragauraṁ karuṇāvatāraṁ

saṁsārasāraṁbhujagendrahāraṁ

sadāvasantaṁ hṛdayāravinde

bhavaṁbhavānī sahitaṁ namāmī




karpūrapūreṇamanohareṇa

suvarṇapātrodakasamṣthitena

pradīptavāsāsahasaṅgatena

nirājanaṁte jagadīśa kurve




Thanks,

Harry Spier
