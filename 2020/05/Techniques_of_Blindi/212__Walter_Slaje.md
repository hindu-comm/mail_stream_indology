> blinding with acid is the technique recommended in AŚ 4,10.13

Is “acid” the meaning of yogāñjana?

Meyer translates „Giftsalbe“ (p. 352).
Kangle translates „poisonous collyrium“ (p. 282)
Olivelle translates „toxic collyrium“ (p. 422)

For the meaning of yogāñjana in AŚ 4,10.13, Kangle and Olivelle both refer
to AŚ 14,1.15, where “andhīkaraṇam añjanam” occurs. The preparation of this
substance with the power of blinding is defined there as:
“Dung of Myrna bird, pigeon, Baka-heron, Balākā-flamingo, made into a paste
with the milk of the plants Arka, Akṣi, Pīluka, and Snuhi, produces a
collyrium that causes blindness and poisons water” (Olivelle 2013: 422).

It is well known that bird droppings consist of uric acid. Their mixture
with plant sap could indeed have resulted in a substance, which might be
seen as a premodern precursor of acid used in today’s attacks going by that
name. Our colleagues focussing on Indian alchemy and medicine will be able
to judge it better.
