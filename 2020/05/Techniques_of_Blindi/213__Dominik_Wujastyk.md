"yogāñjana" could mean "magic ointment" (magic<-yogic), or "an ointment
consisting of a medicinal compound."

The *samāsa* may refer deictically to poisons or corrosive substances
(denotation), but that's not what the *samāsa* means lexically (i.e.,
semantically).

*Arka*, Purple Calotropis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calotropis>, is a
milkweed with a corrosive, poisonous sap. *Snuhī*, a spurge
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphorbia#Irritants>, similarly has white,
corrosive sap.  Etc.

Best,
Dominik

> “Dung of Myrna bird, pigeon, Baka-heron, Balākā-flamingo, made into a
> paste with the milk of the plants Arka, Akṣi, Pīluka, and Snuhi, produces a
> collyrium that causes blindness and poisons water” (Olivelle 2013: 422).
