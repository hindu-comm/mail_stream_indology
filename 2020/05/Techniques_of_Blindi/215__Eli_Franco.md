If my memory does not fail me, Goldstein’s History of Modern Tibet  
contains a firsthand account of a high-ranking government official  
being blinded as a punishment. The technique applied first was to put  
pressure on the temples till the eyes would pop out. When this failed,  
his eyes were cut out with knives.
Best wishes, E.F.

> The passage talking about the substance resulting from a mixture of

> *śārikā-kapota-baka-balākā-leṇḍam arka-akṣi-pīluka-snuhi-kṣīrapiṣṭam
> andhīkaraṇam añjanam udakadūṣaṇaṃ ca* || (AŚ 14,1.15)

> “Dung of Myrna bird, pigeon, Baka-heron, Balākā-flamingo, made into a paste
> with the milk of the plants Arka, Akṣi, Pīluka, and Snuhi, produces a

> Second, the sap of the two identified plants (of altogether 4 plant
