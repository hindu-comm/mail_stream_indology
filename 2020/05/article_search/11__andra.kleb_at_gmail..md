Dear all,

I wonder if anyone may have a scan of Toshihiro Wada’s 2003’ article (and possibly also of the second part from 2005):

2003: “The Generation of Sanskrit Texts in the New School of Indian Logic (1): From Gaṅgeśa’s Tattvacintāmaṇī to its Commentaries"，Journal of Studies for the lntegrated Text Science 1(1): 63-80.
2005: “The Generation of Sanskrit Texts in the New School of Indian Logic (2): From Gaṅgeśa’s Tattvacintāmaṇī to its Commentaries"，Journal of Studies for the lntegrated Text Science 2(1): 43-58.

Many thanks in advance!

best,
Andrey
