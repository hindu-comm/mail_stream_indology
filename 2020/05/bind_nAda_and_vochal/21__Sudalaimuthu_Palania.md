Dear Indologists,



There is a Tamil verse that talks about different actions involved in the production of vocal music. Interestingly, the first two involve bindu and nāda. According to a modern commentator, bindu has to rotate to produce the nāda. He seems to suggest the Mataṅga Āgama might have information about this. I would appreciate any references on any Āgama or Śaiva Ṣiddhānta texts (along with their dates) that deal with the production of nāda from bindu. 



Thank you.



Regards,

Palaniappan
