Dear Friends,

Does anyone have access to this 2 volumed book?
Tantrāgamīya dharma-darśana
by  Vrajavallabha Dvivedī
Hathi Trust has an ebook version, but only allows one to search for word
counts, but not view the pages (if VPN is reset to USA).
<https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/ssd?id=mdp.39015051496688;seq=1>

It supposedly has a discussion of the Siddhāntasārāvali and the rule for
fixing the widths of the sarvasama-liṅgas. If there are other discussions
of this that are available, please let me know.

Thank you.

All the best,

パトリック マッカートニー
