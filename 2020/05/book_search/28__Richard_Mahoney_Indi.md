                            Dear Friends,

            Does anyone have access to this 2 volumed book?
                      Tantrāgamīya dharma-darś
                      by  Vrajavallabha Dvivedī
 Hathi Trust has an ebook version, but only allows one to search for
    word counts, but not view the pages (if VPN is reset to USA).

 It supposedly has a discussion of the Siddhāntasārāvali and the rule
  for fixing the widths of the sarvasama-liṅgas. If there are other
      discussions of this that are available, please let me know.

                              Thank you.

                            All the best,
