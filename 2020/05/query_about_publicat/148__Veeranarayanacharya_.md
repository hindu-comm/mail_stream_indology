Dear All
I am finding it difficult to locate a publication announcement in Indology
list that appeared sometimes back.
It was about a new book on buddhism. author claimed that early buddhism was
not a revolutionary one, instead it was to represent real vedic spirit.
I would be grateful if any of members help me in knowing about this book.
