Dear Prof. Pandurangi,

Perhaps you are thinking of this book by Kamaleswar Bhattacharya, *The
Ä€tman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism*. It was announced here:

http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-May/041196.html

An Indian reprint of it from Motilal Banarsidass is also now available.

Best regards,

David Reigle
