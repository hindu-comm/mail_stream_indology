Dear All,

Thank you very much, the problem has been solved, and I am now able to read the sections I need. I am forever indebted for this and would like to sincerely thank the members of the list and its creators. It is a real lifeline!

Gratefully,
Radhika

I of course would not want to infringe any copyright laws, but would appreciate having access at least to some sections. If anyone happens to have and would not mind sharing the scans of the sections just on Aṣṭādhyāyī 2.3.2 karmaṇi dvitīyā and 2.3.18 kartṛkaraṇayos tṛtīyā, I would be much indebted.
