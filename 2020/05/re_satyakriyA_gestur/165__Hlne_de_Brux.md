Dear Dr. Koch,

In the Avadānaśataka (I. 9, Dhūpāvadāna) is mentioned a contest between a
Buddhist and a religious opponent, taking place through a "declaration of
truth" (satyavacanam) - a similar term for satyakriyā. Before making his
declaration, the Buddhist is described as throwing back his cloth on his
shoulder and putting his right knee to the ground. This is also an
interesting echo of the idea of the bhūmisparśa-mudrā.

With best wishes,

Hélène de Brux
