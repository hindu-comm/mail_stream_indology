Dear List,

One of my old students who is teaching in a West Bengal (India) Government
aided primary school has pointed out the following to me (I've also
attached the screenshots sent by him, which are in Bengali script).

In a text book it's mentioned that the Sanskrit word 'Rﾄ［a'  and the
English one 'Roaming' have similarity in terms of their pronunciation and
meaning, as 'Rﾄ［a' means 'roamer' (i.e. a person who roams), and that  Rﾄ［a
is a hero in the Ramayana which refers to the fact that a group of nomads,
while roaming, entered the Indian subcontinent and settled in the southern
part of India after being settled in the northern part of India.

I'd appreciate to know if the word 'Rﾄ［a' bears any such meaning
etymologically.

Sorry for cross posting.


With regards,
Niranjan
