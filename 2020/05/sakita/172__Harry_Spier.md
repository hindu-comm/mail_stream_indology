Dear list members,

1) If any members have the *tāntrikābhidanakośa*, can they tell me if the
word *saṁkita* occurs in it.  And if so can they scan the page for me.

2) I have "The Heart of the Yogini" by Andre Padoux where there is some
discussion of the term.  Can anyone point me to any articles that discuss
this term in a tantric setting. Or point me to any discussion of this term
in commentaries to other tantras.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
