Dear Scholars,

I am looking for long for a book called 'Sampradāya Kalpadruma' by
Vitthalanātha
or manaraṃjana kavi.
It is apparently a  Pushtimargiya Vaishnava Sampradaya text, which has been
extensively referred to by R B Athawale in his writings on Jagannatha
Pandita,  but all my searches for this book have served futile.

Can anyone guide me to a soft/hard copy of the said text, as also comment
on its relevance in the Pushtimarga tradition?

Kind regards
Santosh
