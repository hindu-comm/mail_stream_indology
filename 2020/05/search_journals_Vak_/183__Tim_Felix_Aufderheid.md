Dear all,

does anybody know whether the journals /*VƒÅk */(only 6 vols. from 
1951-1964 appeared) and /*The *//*Journal of Vedic Studies*/ (only 2 
vols. from 1934-1935 appered) have ever been digitized? And if so, where 
they can be found online?

My own search was quite unsuccessful sofar...

Thanks in advance and best regards

Tim
