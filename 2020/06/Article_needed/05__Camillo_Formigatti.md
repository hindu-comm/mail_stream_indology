Subject: [INDOLOGY] Article needed

Greetings everyone,

I wonder if anyone could supply me with a copy of the following article, which is not currently available to me due to library closure:

Lore Sander, "A Graffito with the Quintessence of Buddhist Doctrine from Ladakh," in Festschrift Klaus Bruhn zu Vollendung des 65. Lebensjahres, ed. N. Balbir and J.K. Bautze (Reinbek: Verlag fuer Orientalistische Fachpublikationen, 1994), pp. 561-570.

Thanks in advance,

Rich Salomon
