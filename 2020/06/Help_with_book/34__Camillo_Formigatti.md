Dear colleagues,

I would be very grateful if you could provide me with a pdf of the following book:

Pal, Pratapaditya. Indian Painting: A Catalogue of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Collection Vol.1, 1000-1700, 1993.

Although our library has a copy, obviously I can't consult it at the moment.

Best wishes,

Camillo
