Dear Friends,

Does anyone know where to find a decent history of Aufrecht's Catalogus
Catalogurum, when it was started and finished, sponsors, who worked on it
and so forth?

Besides: https://whowaswho-indology.info/354/aufrecht-simon-theodor/ (thanks
Dominik) I have yet to find much.

With kindest wishes,

Martin Gluckman
