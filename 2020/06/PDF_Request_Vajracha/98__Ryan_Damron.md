Dear all,

Would anyone happen to have a pdf of Gautama Vajracharya’s “Crown Jewel of Newar Painting: Discovery of a Masterpiece,” which is found in Pratapaditya Pal’s Nepal: Old Images, New Insights? I actually have a copy myself, but it's inaccessible to me at the moment. 

Many thanks in advance,

Ryan
