Dear Christophe,
Thanks for drawing our attention to this important publication.
Felicitations to Prof. Filliozat for this significant contribution to the
history of Sanskrit studies and Indology.
(I soon hope to have a direct view of the book when my mailbox will again
be accessible.)
The Sanskrit grammar by Father Jean-François Pons was not only contemporary
to or a little later than the Grammatica Grandonica but it also showed, I
believe, a better grasp of the subject.
The grammar by Father Heinrich Roth remained unfortunately unpublished till
1988 and it could not contribute to a better knowledge of Sanskrit in 18th
and 19th century Europe.
Jesuits such as Roberto De Nobili (1577-1656) had full receptive and active
mastery of Sanskrit (and Tamil) but wrote no Sanskrit grammar.
Hence, I summarize my preliminary evaluation in Sanskrit:
किमुरुप्रेक्षखण्डेऽस्मिन्   जज्ञौ कश्चन संस्कृतम् ।
साधुत्वेनेयतः पूर्वं   यथोद्यम्यैव पोन्स् पिता ॥
“Here in Europe, did anyone succeed in knowing
Sanskrit correctly so long ago, as Father Pons did
on account of much perseverance ?”
Best,
Jan

N.B. Thanks also for drawing attention to the volume brought out by Jérôme
Petit and Pascale Rabault-Feuerhahn and felicitations to the editors:
another significant contribution to the history of Sanskrit studies and
Indology: *Le sanctuaire dévoilé: Antoine-Léonard Chézy et les débuts des
études sanskrites en Europe, 1800-1850* (Paris: BnF - Geuthner, 2019).
