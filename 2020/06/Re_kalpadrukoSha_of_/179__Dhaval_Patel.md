A correction -
The author is Keśava, distinct from Keśavasvāmin (the author of
Nānārthārṇavasaṁkṣepa).
I apologize for the error.
Kindly note the new URL
https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/kalpadrukosha_keshava/orig/kalpadrukosha.txt

I extend my gratitute to the colleague who drew my attention to this error.
