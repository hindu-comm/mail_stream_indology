Dear all,

a friend asked me, whether I now the origin of Malraux’s following epitaph: “The elephant is the wisest of all the animals, the only one who remembers his former lives; and he remains motionless for long periods of time,
 meditating thereon.-BUDDHIST TEXT”. It’s in Malraux’s Anti Memoirs.

I have no clue. Anybody of you?

Axel Michaels
