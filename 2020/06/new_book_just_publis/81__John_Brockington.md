Dear Colleagues,

I would like to draw your attention to this newly published book:

/Oral-Written-Performed: the Rāmāyana narratives in Indian literature 
and arts,/ ed. by Danuta Stasik (Heidelberg: CrossAsia eBooks, 2020). 
The whole book as well as the individual chapters can be accessed under 
the DOI: https://doi.org/10.11588/xabooks.530(for free download, or 
print editions for purchase). It is the outcome of a panel at the 25th 
European Conference on South Asian Studies, Paris, July 2018).


I should declare an interest in that both Mary and I have chapters in it 
("Showing what is not: the use of illusion in classical Sanskrit Rāma 
plays" and "Stories in stone: sculptural representations of the Rāmāyaṇa 
narrative" respectively).

With all good wishes

John Brockington
