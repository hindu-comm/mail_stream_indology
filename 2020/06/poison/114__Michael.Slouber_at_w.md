Dear colleagues,

In post-classical India, viṣaśāstra became synonymous with a branch of 
Tantric medicine that I wrote a book about a few years ago: 
http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/999908257

Mention of manufactured poison (kṛtrima) is rare in the literature, to 
answer Jonathan comment; one rather used poisonous plants, or less 
commonly, extracted venom. And there are fascinating uses of minuscule 
amounts of poison for healing that I touch on in the book, responding to 
Jan's comment.

Best,

Michael
