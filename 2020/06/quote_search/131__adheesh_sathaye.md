Looks to be Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.2.1.[27], part of a description of the “Great Pressing” (Mahābhiṣava) within a Soma offering. 

sa juhoti | sa prathamā saṃskṛtirviśvavārā sa prathamo varuṇo mitro agniḥ sa
prathamo bṛhaspatiścikitvāṃstasmā indrāya sutamājuhota svāheti 

(from the GRETIL e-text). 

Eggeling’s translation from 1885: “He offers with, ’This is the first consecration, assuring all boons; he is the first, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni — he is the first, Bṛhaspati, the wise: to that Indra offer ye the liquor, Hail!”. (vol 2, p. 285-6).


Best wishes,
Adheesh
