Dear Harry,

I noticed a few other things. The citation from the Marandandāracampū for
the meter Rājahaṃsī given in the three volume 1959 edition of Apte's
dictionary reads राजहंसी नरौ रो ल्गौ यति: स्यादृतुसायकै: giving us the
notation नररलग, but the printed edition of the text in Kavyamala gives the
reading राजहंसी नरौ रो गौ यति: स्यादृतुसायकै: giving the notation नररगग.
However, the example of this meter given in the text,

सरससारसं वारकामिनीपदपराजयप्राप्तदुर्यश: ।
पतितमम्भसि क्षन्तुमक्षमं परवशं मुहु: सञ्चलत्यहो ।।

fits the notation नररलग, indicating that the reading of the definition
given in the Kavyamala edition is faulty, while the reading as given in the
revised Apte 1959 edition is the correct reading.  The revisers/editors of
Apte's dictionary have silently corrected the reading of the Nirnaya Sagara
edition.
