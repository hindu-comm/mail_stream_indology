Dear Madhav,

> indicating that the reading of the definition given in the Kavyamala  
> edition is faulty

Surprisingly, the commentary (/Mādhuryarañjanīvyākhyā/) confirms this fault:

/narau nagaṇaragaṇau ro ragaṇaḥ / GAU GURUDVAYAM //

I guess that the correct entry in the three volume edition of Apte's  
dictionary could be taken from Velankar's /Jayadāman /(Bombay 1949, p.  
126):

"/nararalaga Rājahaṃsī /(6,5) Mm. 9.11, /Vibhūṣaṇā /Vjs [=  
/Vṛttajātisamuccaya /of Vīrahaṅka] 4.94"

By the way, the definition /kanakamañjarī naś ca rau lagau/ is itself  
written in this meter (/na ra ra la ga/; caesura after the 6th  
syllable) - a practice that was probably first introduced by Jayadeva  
(leaving aside the hardly datable /Nāṭyaśāstra/).

Best wishes,
Roland Steiner
