Respected Scholars,I had posted this query in the past.May I be excused to raise it once again , as I haven't got any answer to it.I quote from "Dipavamsa" the oldest Pali Chronicle , from Sri Lanka,which goes as follows-
"DipAgamanam Buddhassa Dhatu ca Bodhiyagamam"I would like to stress on the word"DipAgamanam Buddhassa"
My question is whether any evidence exists which goes on to prove that Siddharth Gautam Buddha visited Sri Lanka?
Alakendu Das.
