I was searching on Google if any text used form चुचोर, and it pointed me to
this page of the digitized copy of the book Tiṅntārṇavataraṇi:

The form on this page is actually चुक्षोर, but obviously the OCR didn't or
couldn't distinguish between चुचोर and चुक्षोर.  But I was amazed to see
how far their OCR abilities have moved.  Best,
