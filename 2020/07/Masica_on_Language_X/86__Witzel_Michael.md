Dear All, a colleague (not on our list) has asked me for a pdf of:


Masica, Colin: Aryan and Non-Aryan elements in North Indian agriculture. In Deshpande, M. M., and P. E. Hook, Eds. Aryan and Non-Aryan in India. Ann Arbor: Karoma. 1979

Though I have the book, I cannot get to our offices/library now.
Any help is greatly appreciated!

Michael
