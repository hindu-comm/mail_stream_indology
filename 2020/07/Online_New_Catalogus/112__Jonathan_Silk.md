This is amazing, thank you Harry!
I looked for some way to say thank you on the website, but I found no
contact information. If anyone knows... (I do not have permission to post
to the google group which you referenced)
(Further, although it is perhaps churlish to ask... if there were a way to
link between the often very complex abbreviations of catalogue references
under each text title to the catalogue of origin, that would be fantastic.
But even as it is, it's a wonderful resource!!
