Dear list members,
I need to provide a transliteration scheme to transliterate marathi hymns
for english speakers to chant.  What I need is a list of those Marathi
devanagari letters that have two pronounciations and what those
pronounciations are.  For example in Marathi ज is pronounced in some
contexts as ja and in others as za . I need to know the pronounciations for
the other Marathi letters with two pronounciations.

Also I have contradictory information about which letters have two
pronounciations.  One source says its च छ ज झ , another source (the wiki
page on Marathi phonology https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_phonology)
says its:  च  ज झ फ

Thanks,
Harry Spier
