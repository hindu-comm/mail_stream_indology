Dear Madhav,

I  believe not, at least not edited by the original group of Pandits. But
when the Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratishthan republished the NSP edition, they
included a sixth volume edited by Pandit Dadhiram Sharma:

https://archive.org/details/TheMahabhashyaOrGreatCommentaryOnPaniniVolume6

On Worldcat they can all be grouped together:

I have pdfs of, and have also seen in my hands, the original NSP edition of
the first 5 volumes, but I have never seen the original edition of the 6th
volume (I think), which seems to have been first published by Chaukhamba,
but I would also like clarity on this matter if anyone knows.

All the Best,
Victor
