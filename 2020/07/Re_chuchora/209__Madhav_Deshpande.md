Dear Jan,

     Narayan Prasad on BVP also pointed to Bopadeva's Kavikalpadruma for
चोरति/चोरयति.  The verb form चोरति may as well be a borrow-back from
vernacular usages.  For now, Bopadeva is a good authority for me to use
चोरति/चुचोर in my verses. The past perfect corresponding to चोरयति is the
periphrastic चोरयामास type, rather than चुचोर.  With best wishes,

Madhav
