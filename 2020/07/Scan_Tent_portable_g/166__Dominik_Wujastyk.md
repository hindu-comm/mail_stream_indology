I recently discovered Scan Tent (seems to be a cousin of the Transkribus
project):

   - https://readcoop.eu/scantent/

At face value this looks promising for anyone travelling around and needing
a convenient, high-quality solution for scanning manuscripts.

If you have tried Scan Tent on Indian manuscripts, please post your
experience here in INDOLOGY.

Best,
Dominik
