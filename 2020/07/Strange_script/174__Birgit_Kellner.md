Dear colleagues, 

a colleague from the Academy sent me the attached image with a script
they can't identify. This is a page from a 17th century marriage
register from  the western parts of today's Austria. The Latin text on
the page refers to a classical bible passage for the instruction of
married couples (Ephesians 5:29). The mysterious script is not Semitic
or Slawic, not Georgian or Armenian, not Coptic or some ancient
derivative of the Greek alphabet. 

Does anyone have an idea? I suppose it's not exactly the right question
for Indologists, but given the wide range of expertise among the
subscribers to this list, I'd thought I'd give it a try. 

Many thanks in advance, and best regards, 

Birgit Kellner
