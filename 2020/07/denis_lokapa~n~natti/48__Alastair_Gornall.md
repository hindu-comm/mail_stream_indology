Dear colleagues,

I am looking for an electronic copy of the following work (or the PhD thesis on which it is based):
Denis, Eugène, La Lokapaññatti et les idées cosmologiques du bouddhisme ancien, Paris, Honoré Champion, 1977, 2 tomes.
I would greatly appreciate it if anyone has a copy and is able to share it (in particular of volume 1).

With all good wishes
Alastair
