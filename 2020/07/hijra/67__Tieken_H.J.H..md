Dear Sravana,
It is not a scholarly article, but may be of interest to you as it deals among other things with the way hijras in India are organized â€“ and see themselves.
I refer to an article which has appeared in Frontline, in of fourth of August issue of 2017. The title of the article is "Hijra has become a political identity". I remembered that I had read it once and found it again by googling "Frontline, India, hijra".
