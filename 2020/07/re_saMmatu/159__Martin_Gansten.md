Dear Daniel,

I think it is unquestionably an /u/ -- I'll try attaching the relevant 
page to this message. Whether it is a scribal error is, of course, 
difficult to say, but it doesn't look anything like a virāma, and I 
haven't seen other such mistakes in this particular manuscript (at least 
not yet). I'm rather inclined at present to regard it as a kind of 
metathesis.

Martin
