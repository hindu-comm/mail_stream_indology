There is discussion of the relative chronology of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka
upaniṣad in Bronkhorst's *Greater Magadha,* esp. chapter IIA.3 and in part
III Chronology.  The discussion is mainly in the context of the doctrine of
Yājñavalkya's teachings and ātman, karman and punarjanman, and does not
discuss the Īśāvāsyopaniṣad specifically.

Best,
Dominik
