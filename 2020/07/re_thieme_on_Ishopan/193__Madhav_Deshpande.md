Dear Jeff,

     I have read through Patrick's Introduction to his book, but he does
not specifically discuss the order of Chāndogya and Īśā Upaniṣads that
Thieme discusses in the paragraph I cited.  I would have preliminarily
assumed that as part of the Śukla Yajurveda Saṃhitā, the Īśā Upaniṣad might
be somewhat earlier.  Best,
