I would add to Aleksandar's suggestion the thought that Chāndogya VIII may be, at least in part, post-Buddhist and in fact a response to early Buddhism. This has to do with the exercise of "finding" (anu-vid, upa-labh) the self, which resonates closely with Pali materials in terms of both meaning and lexicon, but seems framed rather differently than the issue of knowledge of the self in other relatively early materials. If this idea is at all credible, it should not imply that the Chāndogya as a whole is so late, just the redaction of the final section.

best to all,
Matthew

There is discussion of the relative chronology of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka upaniṣad in Bronkhorst's Greater Magadha, esp. chapter IIA.3 and in part III Chronology.  The discussion is mainly in the context of the doctrine of Yājñavalkya's teachings and ātman, karman and punarjanman, and does not discuss the Īśāvāsyopaniṣad specifically.

Best,
Dominik

Dear Colleagues,

     I have been rereading Professor Paul Thieme's article on the Īśopaniṣad published in the JAOS.  In one of his discussions, he seems to claim that the Chāndogya-Upaniṣad is older than the Īśa.  Here is that passage:

What is a good modern discussion about the relative chronology of the "older" Upaniṣads?  Has anyone discussed Thieme's views?  With best regards,
