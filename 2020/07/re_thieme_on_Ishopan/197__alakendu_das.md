Respected Scholars,I came across the following chronological depiction of the Upanishads , while going through an article by Dr.Deviprasad Chattopadhay(published 2010/2012):-AiteriyaVrihadAranyakaChandogyaTaiteriyaKausitaki.
A feature of the above 5 earliest Upanishads, were that they were all written in Prose form.According to the same chronological hierarchy, Isa comes much later, and is composed in rhythms.

  Dear Madhav,
I seem to recall that Patrick Olivelle discusses the relative chronology of the principal Upaniṣads in the introduction to his translation of them, published by Oxford University Press.
All the best,Jeff

Dear Colleagues,
  I have been rereading Professor Paul Thieme's article on the Īśopaniṣad published in the JAOS. In one of his discussions, he seems to claim that the Chāndogya-Upaniṣad is older than the Īśa. Here is that passage:


What is a good modern discussion about the relative chronology of the "older" Upaniṣads? Has anyone discussed Thieme's views? With best regards,
