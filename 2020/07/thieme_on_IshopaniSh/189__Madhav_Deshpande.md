Dear Colleagues,

     I have been rereading Professor Paul Thieme's article on the
Īśopaniṣad published in the JAOS.  In one of his discussions, he seems to
claim that the Chāndogya-Upaniṣad is older than the Īśa.  Here is that
passage:

What is a good modern discussion about the relative chronology of the
"older" Upaniṣads?  Has anyone discussed Thieme's views?  With best regards,
