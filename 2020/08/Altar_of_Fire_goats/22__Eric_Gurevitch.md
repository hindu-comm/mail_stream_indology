This issue is discussed in a rather heated exchange:

Schechner, Richard. 1986. “Wrestling Against Time: The Performance Aspects
of Agni.” *The Journal of Asian Studies* 45 (2): 359–63.

Staal, Frits. 1987. “Professor Schechner’s Passion for Goats.” *The Journal
of Asian Studies* 46 (1): 105–8.

All the best,
Eric
