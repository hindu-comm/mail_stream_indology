Those interested in the Indus Valley seals might like to read "Interrogating Indus inscriptions to unravel their mechanisms of meaning conveyance" by Bahata Ansumali Mukhopadhyay (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0274-1 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0274-1>). This author, a software developer, makes a strong case that the IV signs are logographic, not phonographic. It would seem that there is much information about the IVC to be found in the seals but that we may never be able to use them to discover what language their authors spoke. George Hart
