Dear colleagues,

At the risk of boring you all to tears, may I ask again if anyone has a
scan of the Anup Sanskrit Library catalogue?

[image: anup-biswas.png]
Earlier in the year, Suhas Mahesh very kindly provided a scan of Fasc. 1.
(Biswas 0106, at http://catalogues.indology.info).  But has nobody scanned
the remaining parts of this important catalogue?

The Inter-library Loan office of my university has twice tried to get a
copy of this book, and been unable to do so.

Best,
Dominik
