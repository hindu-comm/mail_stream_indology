I am looking for an article by Chandraleka Vamadeva, "The Concept of Van̲n̲an̲pu 'Violent Love' in Tamil Śaivism, with special reference to the Periyapurāṇam" (Uppsala studies in the history of religions), 1995. I’d be most grateful if anyone has a pdf that they could make available. Thanks, George Hart
