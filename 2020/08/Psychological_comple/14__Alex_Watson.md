There is the important difference, of course, that 'self-actualization' as
it is used in western psychology tends to involve maximal individuation,
whereas ātmasākṣātkāra or ātmībhāva involve the opposite: becoming devoid
of individuation – devoid of both qualitative and numerical individuation
for Advaitins; devoid of qualitative individuation for Naiyāyikas,
Sāṅkhyas, etc.
