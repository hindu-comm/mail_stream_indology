I am puzzled by a curious feature of Sanskrit versification, syntax and
sandhis.  While sandhis are supposed to take place between pādas 1 and 2,
and between 3 and 4, the enclitic forms such as ते and मे, as they come
under the Pāṇinian restriction of अपादादौ cannot occur at the beginning of
any pādas.  I am looking for any serious discussion or research on these
features, and whether forms like ते and मे do occur at the beginning of
pādas 2 and 4 in known Vedic or post-Vedic literature.  I will appreciate
any help you can provide.  With best wishes,
