Dear Jon,

In 1974 AMS Press, New York, reprinted the Sacred Books of the Hindus
series. In their thick paperback reprint of *The **Mîmâsâ Sûtras of Jaimini*,
vol. 27, they also included Sandal's Introduction, vol. 28, of ccxl pages.
If you have that reprint, you have Sandal's introduction. I have not seen
the Motilal Banarsidass reprint. AMS Press also reprinted the ccxl-page
Introduction separately (vol. 28), as a hardback. This reprint is still
available, and cheap, from Powells Bookstore Chicago, through AbeBooks:

It is a high quality hardback. I have both physical volumes.

Best regards,

David Reigle
Colorado, U.S.A.
