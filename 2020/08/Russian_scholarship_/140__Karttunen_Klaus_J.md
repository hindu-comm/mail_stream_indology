 see Radha Balasubramanian: The Influence of India on Leo Tolstoy and Tolstoy’s Influence on India. A Study of Reciprocal Receptions. 15+274 p. Lewiston & Queenston & Lampeter: The Edwin Mellen Press 2013 (which I reviewed in Scando-Slavica 61, 2015, 125f.)

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Russian scholarship on Tolstoj and his reception of early Buddhist thought

Dear List Members,

as I am interested in discovering some more about the inspiration Tolstoj drew from his Buddhist readings, I would like to ask if there is anyone among you who might recommend some scholarship in Russian - whether articles or essays - about this topic. As for the writing I have discovered so far, there's plenty indeed to read, but hardly anything that I would define as scholarship (Ivan Bunin).

I know the subject of this enquiry may appear somewhat divergent from the topics usually discussed on this list, but I wish to consult you as well and not limit myself to the information I can gather from the field of Slavic Studies. I would be extremely thankful for any suggestion.

With kindest regards,

Omar Abu Dbei
