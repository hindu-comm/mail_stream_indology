Dear folks,

Does anybody have a pdf of Sandal’s introduction of volume 1 in Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini, Motilal Banarsidass 1980?
Seems impossible to buy a copy of the book.

or,

Is this identically with Sandal’s Introduction in Mîmâsâ Sûtras of Jaimini, 1925? I do have a reprint of the latter.

Kind regards,
Jon Skarpeid
