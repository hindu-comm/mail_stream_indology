Dear Colleagues,

I should like to bring another new publication to your attention.

Kindly regarding,
Walter Slaje


Bollée, Willem: Alphabetic Contents of Bāṇa’s Kādambarī: Based on Gwendolyn
Layne’s and David Smith's Translations (= Studia Indologica Universitatis
Halensis, Band 17). Halle an der Saale: Universitätsverlag
Halle-Wittenberg, 2020, 168 S., ISBN: 978-3-86977-221-9, EAN: 9783869772219

In the words of David Smith, “there is no Sanskrit poet more interesting
than Bāṇa, none more original, none greater, and his prose poem “Princess
Kādambarī” is his supreme achieve­ment. Always held in India to be the best
prose poem, Bāṇa’s Kādambarī is a master­piece of classical Sanskrit
litera­ture, unrivaled in rich­ness and depth.

The late Professor Willem Bollée (1927–2020) has prepared an index of words
and notions of Bāṇa’s difficult and unique romance Kādambarī with a view to
unclosing the wealth of cultural infor­mation contained in this second work
of genius of Bāṇa. Professor Bollée has released the present edition for
printing. It is the last mono­graph from his untiring pen.
