Dear list members is jayantī in its meaning as birthday (i.e.
kṛṣṇa-jayantī, ganeśa-jayantī etc.) sanskrit?  I had always assumed that to
be the case but a sanskritist told me that jayantī as birthday was marathi
and not sanskrit .  I did not see an entry for  jayantī in Apte's
dictionary or in Boehtlink-Roth but Monier-Williams had a
hanumaj—jayantī f. the
day of full moon of the month Caitra (being the supposed birthday of
Hanumat)

Thanks,
Harry Spier
