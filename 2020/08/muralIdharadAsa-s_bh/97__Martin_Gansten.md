Dr Måns Broo, who is a member of this list but for some reason currently 
unable to post, has asked me to post the following question on his behalf:

> Does anyone have a soft copy of Muralīdharadāsa's Bhāṣya on 
> Śāṇḍilyabhaktisūtra? According to the NCC, it has been printed in 
> Vallabhācāryagranthamālā 6. NS. Press, Bombay, 1915.

Best wishes,
Martin Gansten
