Dear list,

does anybody happen to have a pdf of the following paper by G. Cardona 
and would be willing to share it:

  Cardona, George. 1991. “On the dialect status of Vedic forms of the 
types daks/dhaks”. In: Lakshmi Bai, B. and B. Ramakrishna Reddy (eds.). 
Studies in Dravidian and General Linguistics: A Festschrift for Bh. 
Krishnamurti. Hyderabad: Centre of Advanced Study in Linguistics, 
Osmania University. 263–273.

Thanks a lot in advance and best regards

Tim
