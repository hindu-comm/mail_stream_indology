Dear Patrick,

The text referred to should be the Piṅgalacchandaḥsūtram, which is printed and discussed in this volume:
https://archive.org/details/pingalachandasutraastudyasokechatterjeesastrichandas_202003_76/mode/2up

8.1 of the text begins: atrānuktaṃ gāthā (p. 11 of the book).  I don’t see the pratīka quoted by Medhātithi, but another book
https://archive.org/details/OriginAndDevelopementOfSanskritMetrics/page/n51/mode/2up
says on p. 37 that the phrase atrāsiddhaṃ gāthā used of gāthās not accepted in a particular tradition, those which are anūktaṃ in that tradition (if I understand correctly).  I hope this clue leads somewhere.

Best,
Tim

Friends:

I hope someone can lead me in the right direction in identifying this citation given by Medhātithi (on MDh 9.42) from Piṅgala:

yathoktaṃ piṅgalena: "atrāsiddhaṃ gāthā” iti |


With thanks,

Patrick
