Thank you to everyone who sent me editions of the Chandaḥsūtra with
Yādavaprakāśa's commentary!

I now have three versions in addition to the one on archive.org:

Edited by Śrīdharavāsiṣṭha, Nāga Pabliśars, 2004
Edited by Haridas Sinharay, The Asiatic Society, 1977
Edited by Vijayapāla, Śrmatī Sāvitrīdevī Bāgaḍiyā Ṭrasṭ, 1988.

I would be happy to share any of them. I'm not sure what the policy is
about giving links publicly to material still under copyright...

All the Best,
Victor
