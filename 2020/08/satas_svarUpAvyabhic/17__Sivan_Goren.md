Dear list members,

I'm curious if the saying "satas svarūpāvyabhicāra" sounds familiar to
anyone. I came across it while reading the *Līlātilakam* and it feels like
it might be a quote, although the author doesn't mention a source.
In the *Līlātilakam*, it follows the saying "*lakṣaṇaṃ hi svarūpam*," in
the context of a discussion on the nature of language and the suggestion
that grammar is inherent to language, even if it is not written.

I'll be happy to hear your thoughts about this...

Thank you!
Sivan
