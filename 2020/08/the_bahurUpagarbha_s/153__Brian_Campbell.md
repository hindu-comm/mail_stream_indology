Dear members, I am following up from H.N. Chakravarty's annotated
translation in Sāmarasya and am having a difficult time finding the
following title:
Bahurūpagarbhastotra assigned to the Lalitasvacchanda, with the commentary
(-viṣamapadasaṃketa) of Anantaśakti, ed. Śambhunāth Rāzdān. New Delhi: Śrī
Lāl Bahādur Śāstrī Kendrīya-Saṃskṛta-Vidyāpīṭh, 1986. I am hoping the
kalpavṛkṣa (which is this list) might be able to point me in a more
fruitful direction, or perhaps even have some type of electronic access.

with all best wishes,
