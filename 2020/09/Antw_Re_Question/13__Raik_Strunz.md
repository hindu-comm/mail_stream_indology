Dear all,

the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit has two groups for pratibhū, one
masculine, the other feminine. Further reading the entries for the
(uncompounded) feminine forms, it becomes evident, that these seem to be
mixed up. Obvious cases include e.g. Manu VII.17: caturṇām
āśramāṇāṃ ca dharmasya pratibhūḥ smr̥taḥ | 

Neither the DCS nor GRETIL nor Wikisrotas give attestations for the
f.dat.sg. pratibh(u)vai (or sandhicized pratibh(u)vā+).

Best,


Raik

Hello,
you may also want to have a look at the Dhātupāṭha commentaries on bhū
sattāyām. pratibhū is brought up there as well: p. 6 of Kṣīrataraṅgiṇī
(ed. Liebich) and p. 74 of Mādhavīyadhātuvṛtti (Mysore edition, 1984);
they also do not seem to allow for the alternative forms.

All the Best,
Victor

The question arose because someone asked me if the word pratibhū will
have alternative forms similar to forms of subhrū, like
subhruve/subhruvai etc.  After thinking further about this question, I
came to the conclusion that since we typically use the word subhrū in
feminine, it has those alternative forms similar to matyai/mataye, but
we typically use the word pratibhū "guarantor" in masculine, it will not
have such alternative forms.  However, if for some reason, this
guarantor happened to be a woman, then we could get the alternative
forms like pratibhuve/pratibhuvai.  I have not seen these forms in
actual attestations, but in theory, this is my understanding. Does it
make sense?

Is there a Sanskrit grammar book that gives the full paradigm for the
word pratibhū?  Is it declined like subhrū? Any help appreciated.  Best,
