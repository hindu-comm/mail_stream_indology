Dear Harry,

     The word ārtikyam does appear in late Sanskrit texts, mainly texts
describing the procedure of Pūjā.  I have seen "ārtikyam pratigr̥hyatām".
If you search with the word ārtikyam on Google, numerous such texts will
pop up.  This is probably explainable as Sanskritization of the vernacular
word ārati.
