Dear Prof Deshpande,

This is a problematic question. Śaṅkara is completely unknown to the
authors of non-dual Śaivism or even the dual Śiddhānta Śaivism. In fact
Utpala and Abhinava are using the 'advaita' of Bhartṛhari to encounter the
'advaita' of Vijñānavāda Buddhists to establish their own 'advaita' point.
So Vedānta at large and particularly Śaṅkara is nowhere in the picture.
There is a very nice preface written by Prof Ambikadatta Sharma to the book
of Prof Navjivan Rastogi titled 'Abhinavagupta kā tantrāgamīya
dharma-darśana' (2013) where he philosophically engages with this question
mentioning why historically speaking Śaṅkara does not become important in
the case of Śaiva schools of Kashmir, both dual or non-dual.

Having said that, there certainly are references here and there to
*śāntabrahmavādin*s, but mostly they are passing references. Vedāntins have
never been important for Śaivas. However, I do think there should be a
study that clearly reflects upon the two non-dual positions. I am saying
this because I have myself seen in my own teaching practice that how easy
is it to slip into the shoe of Śaṅkar's advaita when one is teaching
Abhinava, for instance. I am trying to work on something. Let us see if I
can finish it sooner than later.

Best wishes.

Mrinal
