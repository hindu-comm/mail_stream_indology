Thanks, Mrinal, for this clarification.  This question came up because we
have recently joined a Marathi discussion group, where we are reading the
अमृतानुभव, a philosophical work of ज्ञानेश्वर, and the person who is
leading the discussion is mixing up the Śāṅkara Advaita with Kashmiri
Śaivism.  However, it seems to me that Jñāneśvara's own work, along with
his more well known commentary on the Bhagavadgītā, the Jñāneśvarī alias
Bhāvārthadīpikā, are syncretic works. Jñāneśvara's guru is his own elder
brother Nivr̥ttinātha belonging to the Nātha tradition.  So it appears that
a brand of Kashmir Śaivism percolated into Maharashtra through the Nātha
tradition and it got syncretized with Śāṅkara Advaita and Bhakti
traditions.  I am myself just at the beginning stages of sorting all this
out, and I would appreciate any suggestions.  With best wishes,
