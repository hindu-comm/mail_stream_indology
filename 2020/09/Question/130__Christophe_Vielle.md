Dear Madhav,

Here in the Rūpāvatāra the paradigme of pratibhū- masc. (p. 56)
https://archive.org/details/Rupavatara_of_Dharmakirti_M_Rangacharya_1927/page/n87/mode/2up
The word is not given with the fem. in ū (cf. p. 71)
https://archive.org/details/Rupavatara_of_Dharmakirti_M_Rangacharya_1927/page/n101/mode/2up

The treatment you propose for its possible fem. usage (that is like subhrū) sounds logical. However, in his grammar (following the Siddharūpam, a work consisting in a simple list of paradigms, presenting slight variants according to its different editions), Hanxleden says:
bhrū "like śrī", so with the alternative forms dat. sg. bhruvai, bhruve etc. (so idem subhrū)
but
varṣābhū, punarbhū "like kartrī". So varṣābhvai, punarbhvai only (what is seen in the Siddh. eds).
pratibhū- fem. should be declined accordingly.

On these problems, see also Renou Grammaire pp. 325-26

> The question arose because someone asked me if the word pratibhū will have alternative forms similar to forms of subhrū, like subhruve/subhruvai etc.  After thinking further about this question, I came to the conclusion that since we typically use the word subhrū in feminine, it has those alternative forms similar to matyai/mataye, but we typically use the word pratibhū "guarantor" in masculine, it will not have such alternative forms.  However, if for some reason, this guarantor happened to be a woman, then we could get the alternative forms like pratibhuve/pratibhuvai.  I have not seen these forms in actual attestations, but in theory, this is my understanding. Does it make sense?
