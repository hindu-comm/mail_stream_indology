Hello,

you may also want to have a look at the Dhātupāṭha commentaries on bhū
sattāyām. pratibhū is brought up there as well: p. 6 of Kṣīrataraṅgiṇī (ed.
Liebich) and p. 74 of Mādhavīyadhātuvṛtti (Mysore edition, 1984); they also
do not seem to allow for the alternative forms.

All the Best,
Victor
