There is an enormous amount of literature on this subject. Since the
question concerned pre-modern India, one can only speculate about the
practice, as we cannot rely on witnesses' reports. However, the cumulative
evidence of ancient Indian statements compiled from different sources and
periods, and which does not always concern stipulations only, does carry a
special weight.



"Marriage" in the above sense is a ritually sealed, legally binding act in
the sense that the woman would become a widow after the wedding if her
husband died.



The text passages quoted from *Dharmaśāstra*s and *Gṛhyasūtra*s deal with
the selection of the bride before the wedding and with her ideal marriage
age.



For the older epochs, Ram Gopal (quoted earlier) as well as Alfed
Hillebrandt ("Rituallitteratur. Vedische Opfer und Zauber", Strasburg 1897)
and Rajbali Pandey ("Hindu Saṃskāras. Socio-Religious Study of the Hindu
Sacraments. 2nd ed. Delhi 1969) are very helpful.

It is remarkable in this context that there is only one consecration (
*saṃskāra*) for women at all, namely that of their marriage.

WS
