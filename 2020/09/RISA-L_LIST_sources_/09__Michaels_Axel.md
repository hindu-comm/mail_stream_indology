Dear all,

though from the mid-19th century, the regulations from the Nepalese first code, the Ain of 1854 might be instructive, as the norms expressed are much older:

The age of majority was 12 years. ‘No punishment or imprisonment shall be required for children below the age of 12’, declares the Ain with respect to theft (§ 68.7). However, for written loan agreements the child must have been 16 (§ 92.2). And there were different ages of majority for boys and girls:

‘If a minor boy below the age of 11 and a girl who is past the age of 10 from a Sacred Thread-wearing caste have illicit sexual intercourse, the girl shall not be granted expiation. She is excluded from her caste. The boy requires neither royal punishment (rājadaṇḍa) nor a fine’ (§ 92.8)
The Ain also declares an ‘age of having [real] sexual intercourse’:

‘If a boy below the age of 11 and a girl below the age of 10 have sexual intercourse, it shall not be considered that the hymen is ruptured, because they have not reached the age of having [real] sexual intercourse. They retain their caste status and they do not need to undergo penance. Such a boy and girl shall be scolded and be let off. Neither a fine nor a fee is required.’ (§ 92.10).
Best regards,
Axel Michaels

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] [RISA-L LIST] sources on markers of girls' transition to adulthood

> No 10-12-year-old is ready to be a mother in any real way -- physically or in terms of maturation
The facts of the present speak against such an apodictically made biological assertion:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_youngest_birth_mothers

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#cite_note-Teen_pregnancies_higher_in_India_than_even_UK,_US-115
[“In the Indian subcontinent, early marriage sometimes results in adolescent pregnancy, particularly in rural regions where the rate is much higher than it is in urbanized areas. Latest data suggests that teen pregnancy in India is high with 62 pregnant teens out of every 1,000 women.“]

I sense a classic strategy of appropriation, which unconsciously subjects everything to the yardstick of one's own, namely Western, culturally shaped view and personal experience made in such environments. Especially when it comes to historical issues, one can only warn against this. Views grounded in our everyday experience in the West of the 21st century must not be projected uncritically onto “all cultures and epochs”. Studying ancient India means studying the distant past of a very distant culture, which had developed entirely independent of whatever ideas, values and lifestyle the west might entertain today.
The topic of fertility in particular was – understandably – particularly central in the older epochs of India, and the best sources for such historical questions are not the normative legal texts, but the numerous old Indian Gṛhyasūtras, which tradition counts among the Vedic auxiliary literature. Together with the rich and extensive commentaries from the Middle Ages, studied without bias, the broadly spread evidence can lead to insights that may not necessarily meet modern expectations and wishful thinking, but at least allow us to get closer to a reality that lies far behind.

Kind regards,
WS

Dear colleagues,
If I may, although it is important that we have a deep and thorough understanding of textual claims, simply compiling textual authorizations for how young girls can or ought to be "married" doesn't really answer the question of how female adulthood is understood and constituted in any real way. I would argue that the category of adulthood has not really applied to women in many historical and social contexts -- or only in a way that is so gendered as to be a different concept altogether. In particular, reproductive viability is often constitutive of female "adulthood" in a way that is not true of male "adulthood". And obviously the measure of reproductive viability mentioned in legal texts is highly androcentric to the point of fantasy. No 10-12-year-old is ready to be a mother in any real way -- physically or in terms of maturation, no matter what epoch we are speaking of.

best,
apl

As far as my recollection goes - I am not in a position to cite sources as I have no access to the relevant files at the moment -, the consummation of marriage could also take place on the occasion of a so-called 'second' marriage (punar-vivāha) after the ritual wedding of a prepubescent girl. Immediately after she had reached a childbearing age (i.e. after her first menstruation), the girl was brought from her parents' house to her husband's house. This practice corresponds more or less to the garbhādhāna saṃskāra (the rite of "impregnation") and had the sole purpose of making the optimum use of her fertility.

Best wishes,
WS

Thank you to everyone for these very helpful responses.

Amy, you have a very good question, and it's certainly part of what is driving my initial query. I think Patrick Olivelle's earlier response here is relevant, which quoted Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 3.3.1 (his translation):

"A woman 12 years old has reached the age for legal transactions (vyavahāra), as also a man 16 years old."

To Walter Slaje's point, a marriage is a legal contract, and being able to enter into legal contracts has long been established as the marker of legal adulthood. For me that begs the question: what other binding legal contracts were girls and women allowed to enter besides marriage? For example, do we know if they were able to bring grievances to have them resolved via the legal system? (And this may be further complicated by caste/class/etc.)

Another pertinent question for me: was it age, marriage, or consummation of marriage that marked a girl's legal adulthood? The marriage age dropped over time, and girls married at very young ages were often not sent to live with their husbands until after menarche. (It's a modern example, but here in the US several states have no minimum age for marriage, parental and/or judicial consent is all that's required. Girls as young as 10 have been married to men in their mid-late 20s and early 30s, fairly recently, and it most frequently happens in evangelical communities in the rural South. If married at 16 or older, they are legally an adult. But 15 or under, they're not, and can't even hire a lawyer or seek a divorce without permission of their guardian... which is their spouse.)

All of the (very) helpful responses so far reminded me of a book I read a long while back. Narendra Nath Bhattacharyya has some interesting information on all of this in Indian Puberty Rites (p. 37-38):
“In the Dharmasūtra of Gautama it is stated that the girl should be given in marriage at puberty; she is allowed to remain a virgin until her third menstruation. [citation: XVIII.20-23] Parāśara says:

‘A girl of eight is called Gaurī; but one who is nine years old is a Rohinī; one who is ten years old is a Kanyā; beyond this one is Rajasvalā (i.e. one who has the experience of menstruation). If a person does not give away a maiden when she has reached her twelfth year, his Pitṛs (ancestors) will have to drink every month her menstrual discharge. The parents and also the eldest brother go to hell on seeing an unmarried girl becoming Rajasvalā.’ [citation: Parāśara Smṛti, VII.6-9]

“The same is also stated in other Smṛtis. [citation: Samvarta, 65-66; Bṛhad-yama, III.19-22, Aṅgiras, 126-28] The Vāyu Purāṇa [citation: LXXXIII.44] extols the marriage of a Gaurī by remarking that her son purifies 21 ancestors on his father’s side and six male ancestors of his mother’s side. In a later work it is stated that a Brāhmaṇa should marry a Brāhmaṇa girl who is a Nagnikā or Gaurī, the former being a girl over eight years but less than ten, and the latter being one who is between ten and twelve and has not had menstruation. [citation: Vaikhānasa, VI.12] As the marriageable age of the girls came down, the rite of Caturthīkarma naturally became irrelevant and it was performed when the girls attained maturity long after the marriage and it accordingly came to be known as Garbhādhāna.”

Just as a final thought, legal "adulthood" has for quite a large part of human history in most cultures been very different for women than for men, with differing ages, privileges, responsibilities, and legal implications. For that matter, both the idea of a "child" or "childhood" as well as what marks the boundary between "child" and "adult" have also changed.

Speaking of... if anybody is still reading this—not to hijack my own thread, but I'm reminded that I'm also looking for references on children, children's bodies, and rules around children's participation in ritual and public life. Especially on girls, but I'm also interested in the similarities and differences as ideals represented in the texts. But that may be another post!

Thank you all so far!

Dear colleagues,
It would be helpful to know in these contexts what "marriage" means and whether attaining adulthood refers to sexual maturity, or a legal/ritual status, or whether the two are conflated in theory and/or in practice.

These are very young female bodies we are talking about. I'm sure this needs no mentioning, but I will mention it anyway.

Listening in with interest!
