Dear colleagues,
it is shocking to hear that Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan is no more. I join in
mourning the departure of Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan. It is a great loss to the
academic world. Her contribution to the field of Indian Dance, Music, Art
and Culture is immense.  During 1993 -1996, while working in the  Varanasi
Centre of IGNCA, I had some opportunities to meet her. During these last
years  I was in touch with her in connection with getting her Foreword  to
the  Selected articles of Bettina Baümer  volume,

(Bettina Sharada Bäumer



PAŚYANTĪ



Insights into Indian Traditions

Selected Articles)
which I am currently editing. It should have been already published by
IGNCA, New Delhi by now but for some reasons it has been delayed.

I am deeply shocked to hear that she is no more with us. I send my
condolences to her family and friends. Let her immortal Soul rest in peace.
om śāntiḥ.

Sadananda
