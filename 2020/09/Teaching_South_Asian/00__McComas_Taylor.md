Dear Colleagues,

We would be delighted if you could join us for this free online event:

'The many tumultuous and globally consequential events of 2020 have encouraged educators to reconsider resources, methods, and practices in their foreign language classrooms. While many online and global discussions on these topics are broadly applicable to classrooms teaching any language, this group endeavours to highlight those topics which are of special interest to those involved in teaching the classical and modern languages of South Asia in Australia and globally.'
