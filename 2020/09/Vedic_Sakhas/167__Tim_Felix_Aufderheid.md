Dear list,

does anybody know where one can order the following book?

Vedic Sakhas: Past, Present, Future (Harvard Oriental Series Opera 
Minora 9: Proceedings of the Fifth International Vedic Workshop, 
Bucharest 2011).

I know that it was distributed by "South Asian Books" until recently (?) 
but neither the publisher's homepage nor the shop on Amazon are 
accessible/there anymore...

Thanks and best regards

Tim
