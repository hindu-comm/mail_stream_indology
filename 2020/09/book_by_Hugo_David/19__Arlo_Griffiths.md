Dear colleagues,

It is my pleasure to announce the publication of my colleague's monograph on Prakāśātman:

"Une philosophie de la parole. L'Enquête sur la connaissance verbale (Śābdanirṇaya) de Prakāśātman, maître advaitin du Xe siècle" / "Philosophy of Language in Classical Advaita Vedānta: Prakāśātman's Inquiry into Verbal Knowledge (Śābdanirṇaya)" (EFEO / Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften - Monographies 198)

The book is now available on the EFEO publications website:

The book is in French, but here is an English summary:

"This book investigates the beginnings, in the 10th century CE, of an autonomous reflection on language in the “non-dualist” trend of Brahmanical exegesis (Advaita-Vedānta), inaugurated in the 8th century by Śaṅkara. Its starting point is the detailed study of the most ancient text of that tradition exclusively devoted to linguistic philosophy: Prakāśātman’s Inquiry into Verbal Knowledge (Śābdanirṇaya), critically edited and translated here for the first time. The text and its translation are followed by a new edition of its only known Sanskrit commentary by another famous Advaitin, Ānandabodha (11th century). A preliminary study, historical as well as philosophical, introduces some key concepts, and situates this seminal work at the crossroads between two lines of history: that of the non-dualist movement after Śaṅkara (“classical” or “late” Advaita) and that of linguistic traditions in medieval India. On this basis, an attempt is made to understand why one of the most illustrious non-dualist thinkers chose to engage in an entirely new reflection on language, virtually unknown to his predecessors, thereby breaking new ground for what would become the typical Vedāntic reflexion on meaning and interpretation. This approach, centred on hermeneutics rather than doctrine, allows one to understand how philosophy of language came to occupy a prominent position in later Advaita, as the cornerstone of a “system” where Being, however immediate, presents itself through the medium of Sacred Speech."

With best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
