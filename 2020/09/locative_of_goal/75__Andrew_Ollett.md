For what it's worth, the construction is possibly more common in Middle
Indic (see Sukumar Sen's comments in his Historical Syntax, s. 94). I
recall seeing it fairly often, although the only examples that I can pull
up now are piyayama-mūlammi gacchantī (Taraṅgalōlā) and gaō accāsaṇṇēsu
pāavatalēsu (Līlāvaī).
