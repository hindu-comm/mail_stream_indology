Dear colleagues,

I would appreciate it if someone can share a scan of the following
articles. I am unable to access these journals in the library due to the
pandemic.

K. Kunjunni Raja, “*Parisa**ṃ**khyāna *versus *Prasa**ṃ**khyāna *in
Śaṃkara’s Philosophy.” *Adyar Library Bulletin *54 (1990): 191-193.

Vidyasankar Sundaresan, “On *Prasa**ṃ**khyāna *and *Parisa**ṃ**khyāna:
*Meditation
in Advaita Vedānta and Pre-Śaṃkaran Vedānta.” *Adyar Library Bulletin *62
(1998): 51-89.
Best wishes,
Lauren
