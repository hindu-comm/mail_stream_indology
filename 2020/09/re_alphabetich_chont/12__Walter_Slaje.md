Dear Mr. Ferstl,

as can be seen from the blurb, Professor Bollée himself had released this
volume for printing only a couple of days before his death in the course of
which he also decided on the title in exactly its published form. The
publisher and the series editors had to respect his wishes in this respect.
A PDF with Bollée's preface can however be viewed and downloaded on the
publisher's order page before actually placing an order. It reads: "This
first volume analyses the text up to page 237 as far as Kane in his edition
of Peterson (Bombay, 1920-21) and accordingly David Smith's in the Clay
Sanskrit Library 51".
https://uvhw.de/studia-indologica/product/200702_08-221-9.html ("Read
Sample").

Since this one was, as I expressly stated in my announcement, "the last
monograph from his untiring pen", there can be no more subsequent volumes,
unless Professor Bollée returns reborn with the same profession, or you or
someone else with a similar diligence as Professor Bollée take the trouble
to complete his index themselves.

Kind regards,
WS
