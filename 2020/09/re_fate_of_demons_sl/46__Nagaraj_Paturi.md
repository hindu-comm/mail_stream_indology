This theme is also connected to the theme of Vaira Bhakti or Vidvesha
Bhakti.

This paradoxical concept of Vaira Bhakti is rooted in the idea of raaga and
dvesha being the two forms of the same thing called sanga (e.g., in Gita).

Thus intra-Indic historical , global historical, intra-Indic
comparative/cross-cultural , global comparative/cross-cultural  studies on
the theme of hate as a form of love also may provide diachronic and
synchronic clues to the development / occurrence of the theme.
