Dear Colleagues,

warm greetings.

I would like to let you know that the fourth volume of proceedings of the
Āgama research seminars convened by the Āgama Research Group at the
Department of Buddhist Studies of the Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts
has recently come out:

Bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā (ed.), *Research on the Saṃyukta-āgama* (Dharma Drum
Institute of Liberal Arts Research Series, 8), Taipei: Dharma Drum
Corporation, 2020, 1040pp., ISBN 9789575988593.

The seminar on the *Saṃyukta-āgama *was held in Buenos Aires in October
2018, organised by the Āgama Research Group and hosted by Fundación
Bodhiyāna de la Argentina.

Here are the relevant links:

Contents and front matter on the Āgama Research Group publications webpage:

For orders via the Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation: https://
www.ddc.com.tw/book/detail.php?id=8014

BibliaImpex distribution: http://www.bibliaimpex.com

Kindly note that the publisher, Dharma Drum Corporation, is connected to
but independent from the Dharma Drum Institute of Liberal Arts. The book is
available for sale through their website or, probably slightly later this
year due to postal service disruption caused by the pandemic, via the
Indian distributor BibliaImpex.

With best wishes,

Bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā
