Subject: [INDOLOGY] Article by Witzel

Dear all (an intentional email to Indology for once),

Does anyone happen to have a pdf of:

Witzel, M. (1987), 'On the Origin of the Literary Device of the "Frame
Story" in Old Indian Literature', in Hinduismus und Buddhismus:
Festschrift Ulrich Schneider (Freiburg: Hedwig Falk), 380-414.

Would be much appreciated!

All the Best,
Victor
