Hi Patrick,

There’s a Schopen article which I believe is also in the yellow “Bones, Stones” book:

Schopen, Gregory. "Filial piety and the monk in the practice of Indian Buddhism: A question of ‘Sinicization' viewed from the other side."T'oung Pao70, no. 1 (1984): 110-126.

This deals with a few inscriptions with references to non-Indic material.

There is also

Strong, John S. 1983. “Filial Piety and Buddhism: The Indian Antecedents to a ‘Chinese’ Problem.” InTraditions in Contact and Change, ed. Peter Slater and Donald
Wiebe, 171–86. Waterloo, Canada: Wilfried Laurier University Press.

And the issue is discussed in several places in Reiko Ohnuma’s book, “Ties that Bind: Maternal Imagery and Discourse in Indian Buddhism."

Hope this helps!
