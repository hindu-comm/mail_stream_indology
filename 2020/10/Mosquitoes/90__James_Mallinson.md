Dear colleagues,

Many thanks to Patrick McCartney, Cristophe Vielle, Martin Straube, Lubomìr Ondračka, Asko Parpola, Klaus Karttunen, Dan Lusthaus, Steve Farmer, Peter Wyzlic and Dominik Wujastyk for their responses to my request for materials about mosquitoes and disease-bearing insects. As ever, I am bowled over by the generosity of the list’s members.

Yours, with best wishes,

Jim

Ken Zysk and Rahul Peter Das have both written about contagion in the classical texts, while one can also point to the contagious transmission of syphilis mentioned by Bhāvamiśra in his Bhāvaprakāśa (16 cent.).
> Having a medical system that explains disease in terms of individual constitutions raises a difficulty for physicians when faced with finding an explanatory model for epidemic disease (janapadoddhvaṃsa), where everyone comes down with the same symptoms in spite of being different people.  In this case, the explanation is that the shared environment is blighted. (Caraka offers a chapter that has much in common with the Hippocratic treatise "Airs, Waters, Places" as Zysk has discussed.)  And one of the elements in that blight is mosquitoes.  In my essay "Models of Disease in Ayurvedic Medicine" I go into this and give more detail (pp. 46-8 of the published version).

But NB his correct suggestion that none of these link disease transmission to mosquitoes or other insects. That only came following Sir Patrick Manson’s work in China in the late 1870s on mosquitoes as a vector for human filariasis,  Charles Finlay’s early work on yellow fever in Cuba starting in 1881 — which initially was widely ridiculed — and finally Ronald Ross’s work in the Indian Medical Service in the 1890s, which definitively identified the malarial parasite in the gut of mosquitoes transmitting the disease.

A great account by Ross of his work on mosquitoes and malaria — and his life in India as well, where he was born — is found in his massive (and wonderfully eccentric) 1923 memoirs, which you can find scanned in online here:  https://tinyurl.com/yxo7taao <https://tinyurl.com/yxo7taao>

> The strictly medical literature on mosquitoes, India, and many of these other diseases for obvious reasons is massive. A PubMed key word search I made this morning on India, mosquitoes, and malaria — leaving aside all other mosquito-transmitted viruses now known (e.g., Zika, West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue, yellow fever, etc.) — came up with over 4000 titles, going back to an 1899 article in the Indian Medical Gazette entitled “The Extermination of Mosquitoes,” which refers to Ross’s revolutionary work.

For a fine account of that literature, see Jessica Howell’s new book from Cambridge U. Press (2019), Malaria and Victorian Fictions of Empire.

>> The idea of disease had not yet included the discovery of germs (there were occasional theories from Greece, Rome, Medieval Islamic medicine about infectious “seeds” that could be transmitted by contact or through the air, but identifying actual germs awaited the 19th c in the west), so in ancient and medieval India the belief was that disease was more likely to be caused by an imbalance of the three doṣas, demons, bad hygiene, or immodest lifestyle, but not by germ transmission. So mosquitos and snakes — one causing temporary discomfort, and the other more dangerous because of lethal venom — were not considered disease transmitters per se.

It is the alteration caused by contact by a hand, a foot, a stone, a weapon, a stick, cold, heat, hunger, thirst, a mosquito, a gadfly, a snake, a scorpion, etc. What is change in localization? It is the imagination of form, through determined or undetermined mental conception, as such and such or some such other form.

>> "Of these, the venom of celestial serpents lies in their sight and breath, that of the terrestrial ones in their fangs while that of cats, dogs, monkeys, Makara (alligators?), Frogs, Páka-matsyas (a kind of insect), lizards (Godhá), mollusks (Snails), Prachalakas (a kind of insect), domestic lizards, four-legged insects and of any other species of flies such as mosquitoes, etc., lies in their teeth and nails. 4.
>> The venom of a Chipita, Pichchataka, Kasháya-vásika, Sarshapa-vásika, Totaka, Varchah-kita, Kaun- dilyaka and such-like insects lies in their urine and excreta. The poison of a mouse or rat lies in its semen, while that of a Lutá (spider) lies in its saliva, urine, excreta, fangs, nails, semen and menstrual fluid (ovum). 5 —6. 
>> "The venom of a scorpion, Viśvambhara, Rájiva-fish, Uchchitinga (cricket) and a sea-scorpion lies in their saliva. The venom of a Chitra-śirah, Saráva, Kurdiśata, Dáruka, Arimedaka and Śáriká-mukha, lies in their fangs, belching, stool and urine. The venom of a fly, a Kanabha and leeches lies in their fangs. The poison lies in the bones of an animal killed by any poison, as well as in those of a snake, a Varati and a fish*. The poison lies in the bile of a Śakuli, a Rakta-ráji and a Cháraki fish. The poison lies in the bristles (Śuka) and the head of a Sukshma-tunda, an Uchchitinga (cricket), a wasp, a centipede (Śatapadi), a Śuka, a Vala bhika, a Śringi and a bee. The dead body of a snake or an insect is poisonous in itself. Animals not included in the above list should be deemed as belonging to the fang-venomed species i.e., the poison lies in their fangs. 7— 11.”

>> 
>> Later it discusses bites from various types of insects, etc., such as centipedes (śata-padi), poisonous frogs (manduka), ants (pipilikā), “stinging flies” (makshikā), and mosquitos (maśakas):
>> 
>> "Maśakas (Mosquitoes):—Mosquitoes (Maśakas) are divided into five species, viz., the Sámudra, Pari-mandala, Hasti-maśaka, Krishna and the Parvatiya. A mosquito (Maśaka)-bite is characterised by a severe itching and swelling of the affected locality; while the symptoms which mark a bite by a Parvatiya one are similar to those of a bite by fatally venomous insects, and a sting of the points of their antennae is followed by the appearance of pustules (Pidaká) attended with a burning sensation and suppuration therein, when scratched by the finger-nails. The characteristic features of a bite by Jalaukas (leeches) with the mode of treatment thereof have already been described. 18.”
