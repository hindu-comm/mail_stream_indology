>From the Foreword by the Editors:

"In the globalised world of the present, science has become one of the most
important factors determining the structure and dynamics of societal
development.
Its meaning encompasses all regions of the world and drives the further
development of the globalised world. But what do we understand by
science in the face of this situation?
...
Even where the sciences hold to their claim of producing coherent,
justifiable and
criticisable knowledge, the general criteria for scientific knowledge often
require culturally different concretisations.
...
The 19th century has led to the establishment of several new disciplines,
such as history, religious studies, classical studies, anthropology,
sociology,
educational science (pedagogics), psychology etc. These academic
developments
led not only to a professionalisation of knowledge but also to a special
humanities approach to cultural phenomena. Many of these disciplines
have adopted methods that are taken from or modelled after the assumingly
‘better’ verifiable and empirically testable sciences.
... In this competition between humanities, natural sciences
and life sciences, the humanities (and social sciences) often strived for
adopting scientific methods ... ‘Scientifically proven’ has become the
most reliable label for most forms of knowledge.
... All these forms of knowledge production entail an understanding of
scholarship
that more or less excludes other legitimate ways of generating knowledge.
Humanities have therefore often regarded the positivistic scientification
or scientism as a form reductionism. ..."
