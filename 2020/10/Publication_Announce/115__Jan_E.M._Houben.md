This is useful.
To be noted that "Kielhorn as a reprint" was originally written by F.
Kielhorn in English.
Since this translation into German by Dr. Solf (revised by Kielhorn
himself) is already available at
http://www.sanskritweb.net/deutsch/kielhorn.pdf
it would be interesting to know which didactic, pedagogic or economic
reasons have led to this republication -- rather than that of another early
Sanskrit primer in German such as "Stenzler".
