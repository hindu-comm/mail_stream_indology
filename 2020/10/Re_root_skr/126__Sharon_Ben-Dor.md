Dear Madhav,

The addition of suṭ poses quite a few difficulties. Because you mentioned Kāśikāvṛtti sūtra A 6.1.136, I think it is relevant to point out one of the explanations of the Pradīpa and Uddyota under the Bhāṣya on A 6.1.135 vt.7 which offers an unconventional point of view on the matter. There, Kaiyaṭa says that Patañjali’s argument “evamartham eva tarhi kātpūrvagrahaṇaṁ kartavyaṁ kātpūrvo yathā syāt” (Bh III.93.3-4) may alternatively mean that pūrva in A 6.1.135 is used for specifying the stage when suṭ should be added (kālāvadhāraṇa) - when ḍukṛñ begins with the sound k, before the addition of aṭ or the reduplication. Nāgeśa comments that this is Patañjali’s final opinion on the issue. With this explanation, Kātyāyana’s vārttikas 5 and 6 on A 6.1.135, or Kāśikāvṛtti’s sūtra A 6.1.136, are unnecessary. But it does not solve all the difficulties mentioned by the commentators. For example, A 7.2.43 may undesirably be applicable in samskṛṣīṣṭa because there is an aṅga that begins with a saṃyoga and ends with ṛ (sam skṛ+liṅ).

In my opinion, the requirement, introduced by Kātyāyana in his vārttika on A 1.1.66/67, that the preceding and following items must be in an immediate sequence without any other intervening item is unnecessary. As far as I can see, this requirement does not have any purpose and causes many difficulties. In addition, the Bhāṣya on A 1.1.57 (Bh 244.10-11) argues that pūrva is used also when there is something in between, as in “pūrvaṃ mathurāyāḥ pāṭaliputram”, and Kātyāyana says “dṛṣṭam ānantaryaṁ vyavahite” (A 1.1.7 vt.7-Bh I.59.11).

Yours

Sharon

Thanks, Hans. Indeed, that is the sort of difference I am noticing here. Without a comment, Śākalya renders the askr̥ta of the Saṃhitā to akr̥ta in the Padapāṭha. This has both historical and theoretical implications. Since we don't have Śākalya's grammar with us, Pāṇini shows what synchronic grammarians might do with such things. But for this specific example, I don't remember seeing a particular rule in Pāṇini that would take us from akr̥ta of the Padapāṭha to askr̥taof the Saṃhitā with augmentation of the root with "s". The closest I find is P.6.1.136, which says that the augment "s" can be attached even when there is intervention by the past tense marker "a" or reduplication of the root. The example of the first is sam-a-s-karot. In RV we have10.127.03a nír u svásāramaskr̥ta, though the pre-verb/preposition nis/nir is separated from the verb askr̥ta, it is the intended combination nir-a-s-kr̥taor the base verbal combination niṣkaroti/niṣkurutethat explains the "s" in this form. Perhaps a good example of "s-mobile".

Here as elsewhere we need to remember that the Sanskrit grammatical tradition was synchronic, whereas western approaches to Sanskrit, especially to Vedic, tend to be diachronic.

However, there is a general phenomenon in Indo-European, called s-mobile (the varying presence or absence of a root-initials). The Wikipedia entry "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_s-mobile” has a useful summary, as well as some relevant references. (An alternative, but more speculative explanation would be that in structures like namaskṛthe swas reinterpreted as a simplification of earlier ss(similar to asi‘you are’ for expected as-si, not also the Vedic external sandhi for -s#stetc.) and that this led to the notion that there is an alternative root form skṛ-.)

The Padapāṭha of Śākalya presents this form asakr̥ta, indicating that the root skr̥ as an independent root is no longer recognized. What is going on? Can one presume that forms like saṃskarotiwhere Pāṇini prescribes the insertion of "s" are actually survivals of this earlier root skr̥. Please suggest references that I can look up.
