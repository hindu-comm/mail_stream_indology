Dear friends,

The Vivekavilāsa (8.275) mentions kṛtti as one of the characteristics of Buddhist monks:
kṛttiḥ kamaṇḍalur mauṇḍyaṃ cīraṃ pūrvāhṇabhojanam/
saṃgho raktāmbaratvaṃ ca śiśriye bauddhabhikṣubhiḥ//
kṛtti means "skin, hide" and other such things. Does this make sense in connection with a Buddhist monk? Any help or explanation will be appreciated.

Johannes Bronkhorst
