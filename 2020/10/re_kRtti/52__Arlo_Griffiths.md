Can emendations like kuṭī, kīrt(t)ir, kr̥tī, or a compound kṛtti-kamaṇḍalur 'skin-gourd' be excluded?

Subject: [INDOLOGY] kṛtti


Dear friends,



The Vivekavilāsa (8.275) mentions kṛtti as one of the characteristics of Buddhist monks:

kṛttiḥ kamaṇḍalur mauṇḍyaṃ cīraṃ pūrvāhṇabhojanam/

saṃgho raktāmbaratvaṃ ca śiśriye bauddhabhikṣubhiḥ//

kṛtti means "skin, hide" and other such things. Does this make sense in connection with a Buddhist monk? Any help or explanation will be appreciated.
