Subject: [INDOLOGY] Śatapatha Brāhmana PDF needed

Dear list members,
1) Does anyone have a pdf of  The Śatapatha Brāhmana in the Kāṇvīya Recension by Caland .  I was only able to find Vol. II part 2 on archive.org<http://archive.org>.  If someone has the other parts and could send them to me I'd greatly appreciate it.

2) Also what is the most reliable printed edition of the mAdhyandina recension?.  If someone has this and could send it or point to an online version of it would be great   I know there is an etext in GRETIL but as far as I can see there is no information about what printed edition the GRETIL text is from.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
