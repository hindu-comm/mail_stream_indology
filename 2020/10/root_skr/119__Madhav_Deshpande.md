Dear colleagues,

In R̥gveda 10.127.3 there is a verb form *askr̥ta* showing the trace of the
root *skr̥*.  The Padapāṭha of Śākalya presents this form as *akr̥ta*,
indicating that the root *skr̥ *as an independent root is no longer
recognized. What is going on? Can one presume that forms like
*saṃskaroti* where
Pāṇini prescribes the insertion of "s" are actually survivals of this
earlier root *skr̥*.  Please suggest references that I can look up.
