First thank you to Lauren Bausch, Steven Lindquest for the information
about the editions and Caley Smith who pointed me to Weber's edition on
archive.org.

I've just looked at the Weber's printed text .  In the first line  of the
image from the text I've pasted below there are two symbols I don't
understand and have highlighted in red.  I've never seen the first.  The
second looks like avagraha but I'm not clear why it is where it is between
long a and a.
