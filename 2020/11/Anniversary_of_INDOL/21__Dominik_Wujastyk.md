Dear colleagues,

Thirty years ago today I launched the INDOLOGY list:

Today, we have over 800 members and the forum is - I think - flourishing.
INDOLOGY has found an enduring place in our indological lives.

On a personal note, I wish to express my thanks to the members of the
INDOLOGY management committee, whose role in maintaining this forum has
been equal to and often more important than mine.  Thank you, Adheesh,
Philipp, Stefan and Wendy.  And thanks also to past members Audrey, Gary,
John, Harunaga, Madhav, Christian, Birgit and Jan.  Without all your
guidance and daily work, INDOLOGY wouldn't be what it is today.

I will be raising a glass of champagne later today to toast you all and the
INDOLOGY forum.  Here's to another thirty years.

Best,
Dominik


Dominik Wujastyk
