Dear Dominik,
Let me add to the chorus of voices of appreciation. Running a list is a thankless task and fraught with pitfalls! It says much for your perseverance that you have kept this going, providing a platform for many of us to learn much. 
Thank you, 
Srilata

Thank you, Adheesh, Philipp, Stefan and Wendy.  And thanks also to past members Audrey, Gary, John, Harunaga, Madhav, Christian, Birgit and Jan.  Without all your guidance and daily work, INDOLOGY wouldn't be what it is today.
