> Today, we have over 800 members and the forum is - I think - flourishing.
> INDOLOGY has found an enduring place in our indological lives.
>
> On a personal note, I wish to express my thanks to the members of the
> INDOLOGY management committee, whose role in maintaining this forum has
> been equal to and often more important than mine.  Thank you, Adheesh,
> Philipp, Stefan and Wendy.  And thanks also to past members Audrey, Gary,
> John, Harunaga, Madhav, Christian, Birgit and Jan.  Without all your
> guidance and daily work, INDOLOGY wouldn't be what it is today.
>
> I will be raising a glass of champagne later today to toast you all and the
> INDOLOGY forum.  Here's to another thirty years.

> Best,
