Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Anniversary of INDOLOGY

I've had my champagne :-) A very nice, dry Italian prosecco.
Reflecting on INDOLOGY, one remarkable feature of the list is that it's still using pretty old-fashioned software. The forum started with Ã‰ric Thomas's LISTSERV, released in 1986 and run for us by Liverpool University. But we now use Mailman, which was written by John Viega and others and released in 1999, and currently maintained by Abhilash Raj. As we all know, it's just email bouncing about. There are more sophisticated systems available: bulletin boards, Google groups, etc. But last time we asked the INDOLOGY membership if they would like one of these new systems, there was an overwhelming opinion against change. And for me, part of the charm of INDOLOGY is this unfussy, low-tech aspect. It leaves us free to think about Indology.
Best,Dominik
