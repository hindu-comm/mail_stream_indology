Dear list members,

On behalf of Yigal Bronner, I am forwarding the attached call for
applications for a two-year postdoctoral position, focusing on the
commentarial literature on Mammaṭa’s *Light on Poetry *(*Kāvyaprakāśa*), at
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Note the Nov. 30 deadline.

Andrew
