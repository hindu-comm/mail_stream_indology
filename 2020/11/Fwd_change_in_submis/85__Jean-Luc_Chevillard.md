Dear Colleagues,

Because of the uncertainties due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on the organisation of scientific events by the end of 2020 / beginning 
of 2021, the organisers (Ã‰milie Aussant, Pascale Rabault-Feuerhahn and 
Fabien Simon) decided to postpone the *SHESL conference ("Documentation 
and Description of Asian Languages - History and Epistemology") *in 
*January 2022* (the exact dates will be communicated later).

The **new** submission deadline is postponed to *15th March 2021*.

More information here : http://shesl.org/index.php/colloque-shesl-2021/ 
<http://shesl.org/index.php/colloque-shesl-2021/>

Request for information and proposals should be sent to: shesl at shesl.org 
<mailto:shesl at shesl.org>

With our best wishes,

The organisers
