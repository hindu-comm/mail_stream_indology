Dear Alessandro,

"The Encyclopedia of India", Ed. in Chief Stanley Wolper, 2006, has a  
good article on "Jewellery" in vol. II with several bibliographic  
references. And, just in case you are not aware of it, a search for  
"jewellery" in the SARDS database (www.sards.uni-halle.de) gives 26  
results.

With best wishes
Martin

> Dear Members,

> As I am editing the maṇḍanapaddhati (Section on Ornaments) from  
> Utprekṣāvallabha's Bhikṣāṭanakāvya, I woul be grateful if any of you  
> could point me to any contribution, ancient or modern, on women  
> jewellery in ancienti India. References on jewels in literature  
> would be highly appreciated: I am trying to ascertain if the poet  
> had been somehow influenced by other kāvyas or by technical  
> literature. Thanks.
