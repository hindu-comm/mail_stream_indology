more or less as a side note, there is of course considerable scholarly
literature on 'ratna', jewels, beginning I don't know where but certainly
one of the early great works which have stood the test of time is Louis
Finot’s 1896 Les lapidaires indiens. searching google scholar for Finot and
ratna brings up many subsequent works (because so many scholars cite Finot
in their bibliographies).
