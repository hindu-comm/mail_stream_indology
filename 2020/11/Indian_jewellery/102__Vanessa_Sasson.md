Good morning,

We have an edited volume on jewels in the Buddhist imaginary scheduled to come out in the Fall of 2021 with University of Hawaii Press. I am happy to share the table of contents with you, if you want to take a look.

Cheers,
Vanessa R. Sasson

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] Indian jewellery

more or less as a side note, there is of course considerable scholarly literature on 'ratna', jewels, beginning I don't know where but certainly one of the early great works which have stood the test of time is Louis Finot’s 1896 Les lapidaires indiens. searching google scholar for Finot and ratna brings up many subsequent works (because so many scholars cite Finot in their bibliographies).

Dear Alessandro,

"The Encyclopedia of India", Ed. in Chief Stanley Wolper, 2006, has a
good article on "Jewellery" in vol. II with several bibliographic
references. And, just in case you are not aware of it, a search for
"jewellery" in the SARDS database (www.sards.uni-halle.de<http://www.sards.uni-halle.de>) gives 26
results.

With best wishes
Martin
