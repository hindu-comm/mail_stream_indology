Dear Members,

As I am editing the maṇḍanapaddhati (Section on Ornaments) from Utprekṣāvallabha's Bhikṣāṭanakāvya, I woul be grateful if any of you could point me to any contribution, ancient or modern, on women jewellery in ancienti India. References on jewels in literature would be highly appreciated: I am trying to ascertain if the poet had been somehow influenced by other kāvyas or by technical literature. Thanks.
