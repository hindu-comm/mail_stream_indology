On behalf of a student, I was wondering if any of you might have a PDF of
the Sanskrit edition of Nāgārjuna's Ratnāvalī published in Varanasi by
Bharatiya Vidya Samsthana in 2003, edited by Avadheśa Kumāra Caube:
Ratnāvalī / Āryanāgārjuna viracitā ; sānvaya "Vimalā" Hindīvyākhyāsahitā ;
sampādakaḥ vyākhyākāraśca Avadheśa Kumāra Caube.
If it is not available electronically, perhaps someone knows where I could
order a physical copy?

I am aware of the Indica et Tibetica Verlag 1982 edition of this work from
Michael Hahn, but if I am not mistaken that edition was published in Latin
script. My student requires the text in Devanagari.

Thanks very much!

Andrew
