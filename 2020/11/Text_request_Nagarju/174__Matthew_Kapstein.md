Your student should be aware that Tucci’s edition and its various Devanagari successors - Vaidya’s edition etc. - are very much inferior to Hahn’s superb work on this text. In this case, the edition you are using makes a very great difference.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Text request: Nagarjuna's Ratnavali (Devanagari script)

On behalf of a student, I was wondering if any of you might have a PDF of the Sanskrit edition of Nāgārjuna's Ratnāvalī published in Varanasi by Bharatiya Vidya Samsthana in 2003, edited by Avadheśa Kumāra Caube:
Ratnāvalī / Āryanāgārjuna viracitā ; sānvaya "Vimalā" Hindīvyākhyāsahitā ; sampādakaḥ vyākhyākāraśca Avadheśa Kumāra Caube.
If it is not available electronically, perhaps someone knows where I could order a physical copy?

I am aware of the Indica et Tibetica Verlag 1982 edition of this work from Michael Hahn, but if I am not mistaken that edition was published in Latin script. My student requires the text in Devanagari.

Thanks very much!

Andrew
