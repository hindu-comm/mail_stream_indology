Dear Patrick,

Marathi renderings of Bhartṛhari’s three śatakas and Jagannātha's Gaṅgālaharī are attributed to the seventeenth-century poet Vāmana Paṇḍit. There’s some debate among scholars of Marathi literature as to whether there were two Vāmanas, but either way, those texts were adapted into Marathi in the seventeenth century. The question of what constitutes a translation is worth asking in this case, as these 'translations’ are refracted through Vāmana’s unique understanding of bhakti and Advaita Vedānta.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Peterson
