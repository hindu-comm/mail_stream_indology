There is also a Marathi Abhanga rendering of the Bhagavadgītā attributed to
Tukārām.  The 13th Century Jñāneśvarī is more of a Marathi verse commentary
on the Bhagavadgītā rather than a translation.  The 19th century is the
real beginning of Marathi translations of Sanskrit and English works on a
large scale.  This coincides with the emergence of printing and publishing.
