 In the 11th century, a scholar named Śrīdhara selected passages from
Varāhamihira’s *Laghujātakam*, his *Bṛhajjātakam*, and Kalyāṇavarman’s
*Sārāvali* and translated them into new Kannada to create a text titled the
*Jātakatilakaṃ*. I suppose the question here is less what constitutes
“translation” and more what constitutes a “text.” There are a number of
other authors from the period who translate long passages from Sanskrit
sciences, especially the works of Varāhamihira, into Kannada.



Elaine Fisher at Stanford is working on a project right now on 16th
and 17th-century
translations within the Vīraśaiva community. I am unsure if she has
published the materials yet, but she has many.


All the best,

Eric
