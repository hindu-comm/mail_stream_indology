Dear Patrick,

Ñāṇavaciṭṭam is a 16th-century Tamil version of the Laghu-Yogavāsiṣṭha. Ofer Peres from the Hebrew University has been working on this text.

Best regards,
Dimitry

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Translations

  [EXTERNAL]

I have received a query from a scholar not on this list about translations of Sanskrit texts into other Indian languages in the medieval period, say pre- 17th century. If any of you know such translations, I’d be delighted to get some information on them.

With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick Olivelle
