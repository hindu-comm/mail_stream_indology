Dear Patrick,

On the earliest translations from Sanskrit to Newari in the 14th century you can also find information in my 2016 article "Towards a Cultural History of Nepal, 14th–17th century. A Nepalese Renaissance?" In Rivista degli studi orientali. Nuova serie. Supplementi, 51–66. Pisa: Fabrizio Serra Editore.

Best wishes,

Camillo

Dear Patrick, et al,

>From my experience, there are a number of premodern Old Gujarati and Nepali & Newari translations (often quite hybridized) of Śivadāsa's Vetālapañcaviṃśati. On the latter, I can recommend very much a new essay by Felix Otter,  “The Robber, the Demon, the Girl, and Her Lover: An Episode from the Newari Version of the Vetālapañcaviṃśati” in Carmen Brandt & Hans Harder (eds): Wege durchs Labyrinth: Festschrift zu Ehren von Rahul Peter Das. Heidelberg; Berlin: CrossAsia-eBooks, 2020. DOI: https://doi.org/10.11588/xabooks.642.

He has made it available on his Academia.edu<http://Academia.edu> page here: https://uni-marburg.academia.edu/FelixOtter
(On the Nepali, there is Theodore Riccardi’s equally excellent book)

>From what I have seen, it is clear that, generally speaking, these are “translations” of the Sanskrit VP, and not “transcreations” in the terminology of Purushottam Lal (and AK Ramanujan). That is, they largely have a one-to-one textual correspondence with the Sanskrit (Śivadāsa) version.
I imagine there are other examples of such kathā anthologies that were translated rather than transcreated (Siṃhāsana°, Śuka°, Pañcatantra, etc.).


With best wishes,
Adheesh

I have received a query from a scholar not on this list about translations of Sanskrit texts into other Indian languages in the medieval period, say pre- 17th century. If any of you know such translations, I’d be delighted to get some information on them.

With thanks and best wishes,

Patrick Olivelle
