Dear Friends,

This morning, while on my constitutional walk around the lake near my
house, I sat and watched one tree shed most of its leaves in a few short
minutes. It reminds me of one of my favourite Sanskrit words - nipalāśam -
as softly or silently as the falling of leaves.

As the leaves fell, they made this crackling/scraping noise while passing
the other soon to follow leaves.

It made me wonder:
1) Is there a word describing the sound of leaves not falling softly or
silently?
2) Is there a word for the sound of a leaf hitting the ground?


All the best,

パトリック マッカートニー
