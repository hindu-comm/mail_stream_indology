Along the lines of Professor Dhadphale's suggestion for *vekurañja *as
coming from Skt. *dvaikulajanya*, there are expressions like
*dvaimātura*, *ṣāṇmātura
etc. *The term *dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa* refers to a son with two fathers, one legal
and the other biological. The sons born out of the so-called *niyoga
*"levirate"
are described with this term.  The term *kuṇḍa *used in the passage has a
meaning of "out of wedlock," but having a dual connection, suggesting
something unnatural, illegal.   So *dvaikulajanya* sounds like a very
possible source.  I wonder if there is a northern Sanskrit āgama version.
I read from earlier messages that the non-Pali versions translated into
Chinese show that this term was eliminated from the text, possibly being
considered some sort of an error.
