Is there a Skt term for a hinny?

Cp. Mokṣopāya  I.38.8:
aviśrāntamanāḥ śūnyam āyur ātatam īhate |
duḥkhāyaiva vimūḍho 'ntar garbham *aśvatarī* yathā ||

Bhāskarakaṇṭha explains it as follows:
"aśvatarī"* kharastriyām aśvāj jātā* vaḍavā | tasyā "garbhaḥ" kukṣipāṭanaṃ
vinā na niryāti (Mokṣopāyaṭīkā on I.13.8)

Cp. the translation by Roland Steiner (Wiesbaden 2014: p.52):
13.8 Ein innerlich verwirrter [Mensch, dessen] Denken *(manas)* nicht
beruhigt [ist], strebt nach einem leeren, ausgedehnten Leben, [das einem]
nichts anderes als Leiden [einträgt], wie eine *Maul­­eselstute*[1] <#_ftn1>
eine Leibesfrucht [begehrt].

------------------------------

[1] <#_ftnref1> Eine Maul­­eselstute (Vater: Pferdehengst; Mutter:
Eselstute) kann nach Bhāskarakaṇṭha nur mit Kaiserschnitt gebären; MṬ I *ad*
13.8: *aśvatarī kharastriyām aśvāj jātā vaḍavā / tasyā garbhaḥ kukṣipāṭanaṃ
vinā na niryāti*.


pw offers a series of entries of Sanskrit words for "Maulthier" (= "mule"):

and gives one entry for "Maulesel" (= "hinny"), namely dvijātīya. Schmidt
adds "°pāraśama":
