While Professor Dhadphale's etymology for *vekurañja <dvaikulajanya *connects
*ñja *with *janya*, I have observed another Sanskrit usage with *jña* that
may be of some interest. The word *svopajña* is conventionally used for
self-authored commentaries and one can see this word in numerous
publications.  Offhand, I don't know how old this expression is, and I have
not seen any traditional explanation of the word *svopajña*.  It seems to
me that the component *upajña *in this word makes better sense with the
verb *upajāyate* than with *upajānāti*.  So here we have a possible
instance of *jña* in the sense of *janya*. Just an early morning thought.
