Dear List members,

I have not closely followed the discussion of the word vekurañja. I did see, though, that the discussion has switched to aśvatara. This word is discussed by R;L. Turner, "Type aśvatara in New Indo-Aryan", which has appeared in Pratidānam. Indian, Iranian and Indo_European Studies Presented to F.B.J. Kuiper. The Hague, 1969, pp. 319-20.

I am afraid, though, this article is helpful in the present discussion about the meaning and derivation of vekurañja.
