Dear list members,

the Department of Theology at Uppsala University has announced 6
PhD-positions. Applications can be made to any of the department's seven
disciplines, among which one will find History of Religions and World
Christianity. It would be great to get applications for projects on Indian
religions, so please help spread the word.

Deadline for applications is 15 February 2021. Conditions are good, with a
salary for four years.
