Dear Colleagues,
I'm writing to share the programme of the Sanskrit Reading Room at SOAS for
the first half of 2021. Please write to srr at soas.ac.uk to register your
interest in the sessions and to join the mailing list. All events will be
online and, due to time zone differences, the schedule is not as regular as
it was in the past. Registration for individual sessions will be announced
separately closer to the events (via the mailing list, SRR Facebook page
and blog). Texts and meeting links will be shared with registered
participants in advance.

With warm wishes,

Lidia Wojtczak
Lecturer in Sanskrit
SOAS University of London
