Dear List,

Does anybody know the source of the following verse?
devadatto ghaṭībhūto, ghaṭaṃ vetti ghaṭātmanā prakāśate

It appears in the Naṭāṅkuśa, a polemical text, perhaps from the 15th century Kerala, against the innovations of the Kūṭiyāṭṭam theater. The quote seems to refer to an Advaitin epistemological stance on perception, where the consciousness conditioned by a cognized object becomes identical with the consciousness conditioned by a cognizing subject.

I'll appreciate your help!
Dimitry
