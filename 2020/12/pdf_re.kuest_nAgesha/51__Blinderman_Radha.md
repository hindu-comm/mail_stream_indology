Dear All,

Apologies if I am asking for too much in my holiday text-hoarding frenzy,
but could someone share or let me know where I can find Nāgeśa's Uddyota
(at least for Adhyāyas 2&3) and this article mentioned in Cardona's survey
of research: ‘Ramanujacharya, N.S. 1966 "Kriyā-viśeṣaṇānāṃ
karmatvam" [Adverbs as objects], SVUOJ 9 (Sanskrit section): 9-14. [In
Sanskrit]'. I spent a lot of time trying to track this article, but to no
avail so far.

Gratefully as ever,

Radhika
