Dear All,

I just got a scan of Ramanujacharya's "Kriyā-viśeṣaṇānāṃ karmatvam"
and wanted to express my gratitude for getting this long saught opportunity
to read this paper, so many thanks for sharing! Also, if anyone happens to
have this paper by Bahulikar, kindly let me know.

Bahulikar, Saudamini, "The constructions stokaḥ pākaḥ and stokam
pākaḥ", *Proceedings
and Transactions of the All India Oriental Conference*, 22, pp. 93-98.
(1966)

कृतज्ञतापूर्वकं भवदीया,
राधिका
