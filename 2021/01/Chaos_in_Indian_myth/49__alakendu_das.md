Dr Dimitry.As far as "chaos" in Indian Philosophy is concerned, concepts
like "Vada , Jalpa , Vitanda" , being the Sanskrit equivalents of Argument and counter-arguement , as propounded in the Nyay school of Indian Philosophy , may be an answer to your query.

Dear list members,
I would be very thankful for any suggestions and works, which have studied the concepts in Indian philosophy and religion related or similar to the Western concept of "chaos".
