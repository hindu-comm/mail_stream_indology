Hi Dmitry,

If you are interested in social chaos, the obvious notion is the upheaval
that arises in the Kali Yuga, but especially at the end of the Kali Yuga.
The confusion of social classes, the varṇa-saṃkara, where people from one
varṇa behave like those of a different varṇa, is considered the worst
offense, especially between the two extremes, when brahmans behave like
śūdras and vice versa. There is also moral deterioration.

This idea is put forth in the Mahābhārata, and later becomes common in the
Purāṇas. See Mbh 3.188 for a description of the social chaos, and Mbh 3.189
for how Kalki redresses the situation (this is the first mention of Kalki
in the literature). The references are to the Critical Edition. You can see
van Buitenen's translation in his vol 2, which includes books 2 & 3.

Best,

Luis

UC, Berkeley
