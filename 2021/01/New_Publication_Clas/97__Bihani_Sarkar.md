Dear All,

I am pleased to announce the publication of my next book *Classical
Sanskrit Tragedy: The Concept of Suffering and Pathos in Medieval India*
(Bloomsbury-IB Tauris):
https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/classical-sanskrit-tragedy-9781788311113/

I express my heartfelt gratitude to the anonymous peer-reviewer for her/his
pertinent and knowledgeable suggestions in improving the book. I am also
grateful to Professor Sheldon Pollock and Dr. Csaba Dezso for kindly
endorsing the book. Gratitude is expressed in the book's Acknowledgement to
many invaluable *sahṛdaya*s and* hitaiṣī*s, who poured assistance like the
*megha* in the *Meghadūta* pours nourishing rain.

Details regarding content as follows:

*Book description*

It is often assumed that classical Sanskrit poetry and drama (*kāvya*) lack
a concern with the tragic. However, as made clear in this book, this is far
from the case. This re-evaluation of 'tragedy' in classical Sanskrit
literature draws on a wide range of Sanskrit dramas, poems and treatises –
many passages among which are translated for the first time into English –
to provide a fuller history and re-conceptualization of the tragic in
Indian literature from the second to the fourth centuries.



Looking at Kālidāsa, the most celebrated writer of Sanskrit poetry and
drama (*kāvya*), this book argues that constructions of absence and grief
are central to Kālidāsa’s compositions and that these ‘tragic middles’ are
much more sophisticated than previously understood. For Kālidāsa, tragic
middles are modes of thinking, in which he confronts theological and
philosophical issues. Through a close literary analysis of the tragic
middle in five of his works, the *Abhijñānaśakuntalā*, the *Raghuvaṃśa,*
the *Kumārasambhava,* the *Vikramorvaśīya* and the *Meghadūta,* the book
demonstrates the importance of tragedy for classical Indian poetry and
drama in the early centuries of the common era. These depictions from the
Indian literary sphere, by their particular function and interest in the
phenomenology of grief, challenge and reshape in a wholly new way our
received understanding of tragedy.
