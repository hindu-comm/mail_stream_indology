Dear Dimitry, 

I can’t imagine this is the chaos you’re looking for, but for what it’s worth, the anti-Mādhva polemics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries frequently accuse Mādhvas of engaging in a kind of exegetical chaos, evident in various phrases like “vedaviplāvana,” “mīmāṃsāvyākaraṇādimāryādollaṅghanam,” and “vedavedāṅgādiṣu ucchṛṅkhalam valgyate.” 

Best wishes,
