Dear Dmitry,

Putting aside the lexical question, for relevant mythology you may wish to consult Wendy O'Flaherty's
The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology.

The issue must also be broached in work on the Mahabharata and Bhagavadgita, where the collapse of social order is a paramount concern. Perhaps some others who are more familiar with epic studies than I might have some recommendations for you.

good luck,
Matthew

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Re. Chaos in Indian mythology and philosophy

Dear Dimitry,

I can’t imagine this is the chaos you’re looking for, but for what it’s worth, the anti-Mādhva polemics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries frequently accuse Mādhvas of engaging in a kind of exegetical chaos, evident in various phrases like “vedaviplāvana,” “mīmāṃsāvyākaraṇādimāryādollaṅghanam,” and “vedavedāṅgādiṣu ucchṛṅkhalam valgyate.”

Best wishes,
Jonathan Peterson
