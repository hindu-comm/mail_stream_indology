Dear colleagues,

Could anyone oblige me by sending a PDF copy of the following article? I have been unable to obtain it through the usual channels.

Reinvang, R. 2000. ‘A Critical Survey of the Dialogue between Yājñavalkya and Maitreyī in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4 and 4.5.’ Acta Orientalia (the Scandinavian one) 61: 145–202.

Many thanks in advance ... from Simon Brodbeck (Cardiff University).
