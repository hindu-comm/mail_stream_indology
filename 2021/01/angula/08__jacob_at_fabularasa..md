Dear list,

Is there any consensus on what an aá¹…gula corresponds to in the metric 
system? Or should we not consider it an absolute standard, but rather 
take it literally as the breadth of a finger (with all the uncertainties 
that follow)? There are a lot of suggestions floating around on the 
internet, but I would be interested in any scholarly references.

Best,
Jacob
