James:

There are numerous instances where aṅgula is not personal but an objective measure:

See Arthaśāstra, 2.11.76, 80, 84; 2.19.11, 12 etc. I have assumed it to be approximately 2 cm long.

Hi Jacob

>From the Sanskrit text translation work I've done on measurements, the aṅgula or finger-width measurement is specific to the individual. My finger widths differ from yours or my wife's, etc., but when I measure distances on my body using my finger widths, those will match the same distances on my wife's body using her finger widths. I've tested this quite a few times and was a bit astonished to find it consistently true. Others may differ (I'm very interested to hear if that's so), but the idea as I understand it is that an aṅgula is personal measurement, not a standardized measurement like a metre/meter, cm, mm, inch, etc. In this sense there is no uncertainty involved, just inter-individual variation.

No doubt there's more to this topic, but this is my bit I can comment on.

Cheers
James

Dear list,

Is there any consensus on what an aṅgula corresponds to in the metric
system? Or should we not consider it an absolute standard, but rather
take it literally as the breadth of a finger (with all the uncertainties
that follow)? There are a lot of suggestions floating around on the
internet, but I would be interested in any scholarly references.

Best,
Jacob
