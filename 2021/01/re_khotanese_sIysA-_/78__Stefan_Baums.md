Dear Diego,

it is true that regularly in G between vowels, OIA th and dh
develop to [z], while OIA t and d develop to [ð]. Note, however,
also Brough, Gāndhārī Dharmapada, § 43, where he suggests that the
development th, dh > [z] proceeded via [ð], and that palatal
environments (as in Sītā) may have accelerated it.

There are some few words in G proper where we have a [z] for
expected [ð], such as samughasa- < (apparently) OIA samudhghāta-
in line 11 of the Senavarma inscription:

That is interesting.

All best,
