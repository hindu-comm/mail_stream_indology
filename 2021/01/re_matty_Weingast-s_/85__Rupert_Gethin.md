Dear Matthew,

The following reviews some of the relevant issues:

Pontillo, Tiziana and Chiara Neri, ‘The Case of Yogakṣema/yogakkhema in Vedic and Suttapiṭaka Sources: In Response to Norman’, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 47 (2019), 527–63.

Best wishes,

Rupert

Yes, thank you, Patricia, - it has been widely.

To the list more generally -

There is one question it raises for me, not about Weingast's fantasies, but about K. R. Norman's
translation cited herein. In the first verse quoted, he renders yogakkhema (= Skt. yogakṣema) as "rest-from-exertion". Charles Hallisey, in his recent translation of the same work https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674427730
gives "safety," which seems more plausible to me in light of the Sanskrit usage.

I would be grateful for any insights you might have into Norman's treatment of the term and, more generally, into the semantic range of the curious expression yogakṣema. Tibetan lexicographers, by the way, treated it as having the meanings "accomplished" (grub-pa = siddha) and "comfort/ease/happiness" (bde-ba = sukha).

best to all,
Matthew

Dear all,

I thought you might find this article on the myriad issues with a recent publication of the Therīgāthā of interest.
