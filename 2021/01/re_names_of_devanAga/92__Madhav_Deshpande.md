Dear Matthew,

     I have not seen such names for the penstrokes in Sanskrit, but you
will need to look for them in the vernacular languages.  For example,
Marathi has such names.  When you add ा to क to write का, you are adding a
काना. When you are adding ि to क to write कि, you are adding a वेलांटी.
When you are adding an अनुस्वार, the dot is called a टिंब. I am attaching a
chart of these from the 1857 Grammar of Marathi by Dadoba Pandurang:
