Dear Dean,

This has been my go-to for years:

https://keyman.com/keyboards/heidelberginputsolution

It is free, works on PC and Mac, and allows you to type nagari and
transliteration in exactly the same way. You simply download the
transliteration and devanagari 'keyboards', and can define shortcuts with
which to activate whichever keyboard you want at any given moment.

All best,
   Antonia
