Dear Dean,
If you use microsoft word its quite easy to create a word template with
keyboard shortcuts to create the diacriticals.  If you use libreoffice (an
open source program like microsoft office) you can create macros to convert
from harvard-kyoto to diacriticals.  If you need more details then just
contact me.
