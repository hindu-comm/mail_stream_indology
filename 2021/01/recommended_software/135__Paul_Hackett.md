Dear Piotr,

   You cannot send a “.zip” file through a Listserv; it will be deleted as a security precaution (some systems will automatically execute them, which makes them a vector for malware & viruses).

   Instead, you should upload the .zip file to a file-sharing website and provide the download link in your email.  

Regards,

Paul Hackett

The keyboard follows both ISO 15919 and IAST. In fact, as you will see, it handles almost all possible diacritics (see the file "keyboard for IBus description.pdf").
