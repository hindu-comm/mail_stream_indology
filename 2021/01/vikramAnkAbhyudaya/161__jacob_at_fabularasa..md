Dear friends and colleagues,

I am looking to access a copy of the Vikramāṅkābhyudaya by Someśvara 
III. An edition was published as "Vikramāṅkābhyudayam of Someśvara" by 
M. L. Nagar in Gaekwad’s Oriental Series, no. 150. I have looked in vain 
in all the usual places online, and would be grateful for any pointers 
toward a digital copy.

Best regards,
Jacob
