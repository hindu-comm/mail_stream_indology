Dear (especially German) Colleagues,

Might you know if Christian Lassen published reviews/articles in 
/Hermes, oder kritisches Jahrbuch der Literatur/ in the 1830s, as A. W. 
Schlegel suggested he do? WorldCat shows that magazine to be preserved 
almost exclusively in German libraries, and I have not found digitized 
copies for the 1830s.

With thanks and best wishes,
Rosane Rocher
