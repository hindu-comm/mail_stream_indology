Thank you to those members who replied on list Nagaraj Paturi, Rajam and to
those who replied off-list, Andrew Ollett and Yūto Kawamura.
An especial thanks to Madhav Deshpande for his superb article.
On page 430 of that article he wrote:

 . . . in the passage *śrī**savitā**sūryanārāyaṇadevatāprītyartham* . . .
Here, the expression *devatāprityartham* is a genuine classical Sanskrit
expression. . . The form *savitā *is a hanging nominative form, which
cannot be grammatically justified in this context. One would expect the
form *savitṛ* to appear in the compound. However, the vernacular-speaking
audience, and the priest himself, have a greater recognition of the
nominative form savitA than he abstract base-form *savitṛ*. The nominative
Sanskrit form *savitā* has been inherited by Marathi, but not the abstract
base-form *savitṛ*.


Is the form  dhātā  in dhātāśaṅkaramohinī in Verse 5 of the
kuṇḍalinīstavaḥ also
a vernacular  form.  Verse 5 of the  kuṇḍalinīstavaḥ is :

dhātāśaṅkaramohinī tribhuvanacchāyāpaṭodgāminī
saṁsārādimahāsukhapraharaṇī tatra sthitā yoginī
sarvagranthivibhedinī svabhujagā sūkṣmātisūkṣmā parā
brahmajñānavinodinī kulakuṭī vyāghātinī bhāvyate

Thanks,
Harry Spier
