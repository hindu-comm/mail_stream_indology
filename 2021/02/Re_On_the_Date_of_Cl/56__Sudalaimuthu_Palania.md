    Dear JLC,

    Thank you for this link. I should acknowledge that long time ago, it was Rajam who pointed out this type of usage in Classical Tamil to me. It should also be noted that some commentators call this technique by the term 'veḷippaṭai'. This is how Tamil Lexicon explains the term, "(Rhet.) A figure of speech in which the meaning of an ambiguous word is made clear by the use of a qualifying word, as pāyā- vēṅkai; பல்பொருள் குறிக்குஞ் சொல்லை ஒரு பொருட்கு நியமிக்கும்பொருட்டு ஏற்றதோர் அடை கொடுத்துக் கூறும் அணிவகை. (புறநா. 17, உரை.)" It should be noted that by this definition, even affirmatively explaining a homonym is called 'veḷippaṭai'.  Indeed, the example cited by the Tamil Lexicon is one such usage in Puṟam 17.13, i.e., 'aṭu poruna' making clear that by 'poruna' the warrior-king is indicated and not a bard. The commentators also use this term in regards to 'pūvā vañci (Puṟam 32.2), uḻāa nāñcil (Puṟam 139.8), and urāak kutirai (Puṟam 168.14). However, one can see that most of the examples use NAP in these usages.

    That is why I was surprised that commentators like Vēṅkaṭacāmi Nāṭṭār missed the significance of the expression 'eḻāap pāṇaṉ'.

    Palaniappan

        >>         A. Nilakanta Sastri, the scholars have simply used the gotra
        >>         names in the absence of dynastic names.  (Early History of the
        >>         Andhra Country, p.151, n.1). Moreover, it is only in the
        >>         tALagunda inscription we find the occurrence of 'bRhad-bANa'.
        >>         Everywhere else in non-Tamil inscriptions, the members of the
        >>         dynasty are called bANarAja, bANAdhirAja-. In other words we
        >>         only find bANa- but not bRhad-bANa. But in Tamil we find many
        >>         instances of perumpANaraicar, permpANan, etc.
        >>         This leads one to infer that the author of the tALagunda
        >>         inscription was simply translating the name perumpANan2 into
        >>         Sanskrit. Since in Tamil -p- following nasal -m- is pronounced
        >>         as -b-, the author of tALagunda has rendered the first
        >>         component as bRhad and kept the second part as bANa. This
        >>         suggests that the original form of the dynastic name should
        >>         have been Ta. pANan2. It is also possible that in the Kannada
        >>         and Telugu areas 'pANa-' was being pronounced as 'bANa' either
        >>         independently or influenced by the pronunciation of '- pANan2'
        >>         in perumpANan2 as '-bANan2' .  Once the stand-alone form
        >>         'bANa' becomes widespread, a re-branding using a Sanskrit
        >>         mythological pedigree tracing the lineage to mahAbali, father
        >>         of bANAsura is carried out with the dynastic title as 'bANa'.
        >>         Later when this form 'bANa' is imported back into Tamil, Skt.
        >>         bANa > Ta. vANa-.
        >>         In the book "ceGkam naTukaRkaL" inscription no. 1971/54 of the
        >>         2nd year of Narasimhavarman II mentions a vANakO atiraicar. In
        >>         the same collection, no. 1971/73 of the 10th year of the same
        >>         king mentions a perumpANatiyaraicar.
        >>         The phrase "ezAap pANan2" further points to the homophon
        >>         indicating bard as well as the chieftain suggesting in this
        >>         case that the chieftain was called 'pANan2' too with
        >>         word-initial p-.
        >>         As for the domicile and area controlled by the pANan2/bANa
        >>         chiefs, it has varied historically. They might have started
        >>         near Gingee where the paRaiyan2paTTu inscription is found
        >>         mentioning 'pANAtu'. (At least one variant of akam.155
        >>         mentions pANATu. See Early Tamil Epigraphy, p. 629 for a
        >>         discussion of this.) Then they could have moved north so that
        >>         by the 4th century they are found near zrIparvata hill. After
        >>         serving the Chalukya, Pallava, and Chola dynasties, in the
        >>         13th century, we see bANa chieftains with titles such as
        >>         mAvali vANAdirAyan, mAbali vANarAyar, etc., controlling parts
        >>         of the pANTiya country under the pANTiyas. As a parallel case,
        >>         it should be noted that a branch of the Cholas, Telugu Cholas,
        >>          were controlling areas around Sonepur in Orissa in the 12th
        >>         century issuing inscriptions in Sanskrit tracing their descent
        >>         to Chola karikAla and uRaiyUr (EI 28, p. 286) progressively
        >>         moving northeast from the area to the north of the Tamil
        >>         country over several centuries.
        >>         In my opinion, the pANan2 mentioned in Akam 113 and 226
        >>         referred to one or more members of the same lineage later
        >>         called the bANas.
        >>         kaTTi mentioned in akam 226 is also mentioned in akam 44 as
