We've noticed that some posts to the INDOLOGY forum are not getting
properly archived; in the archive, the messages are blank.  After some
investigation, it seems that this applies to messages that are sent "in
HTML format only".

If you can, please check that your email program sends messages "in HTML
and plain text".  That will ensure that your messages get archived.  It's
also the best way to send email.  There should always be a "plain" text
version.

This problem has surfaced now, but isn't new.  It was the case for messages
during past years too.  So there are some blank entries in the archive,
unfortunately.

Best,

Dominik Wujastyk
INDOLOGY list <http://indology.info> committee member
