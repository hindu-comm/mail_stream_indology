Dear friends,
I am helping the local Hindu Association to catalogue some 19th century tombstones here in Hong Kong. I wonder if someone could help me to transcribe the Tamil inscription and to direct me to some resources on the practice of tombstone inscription in Tamil. I include some photos here. Please contact me either on or off list.
Many thanks,
Bill Mak
