Dear All,A friend of mine who is not on the list would require a PDF of the following title: 
Marcelle Lalou, “Iconographie des étoffes peintes (Paṭa) dans le Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa”, Paris (Geuthner) 1930. If there were a later edition, that would be fine, too. 
If anyone might be able to share it, that would be wonderful.
Regards,Corinna

Dr. Corinna Wessels-Mevissen, Berlin/Germany
