Thank you very much to Michael, Madhav and Harry for all these very 
interesting documents !
I even found, in the Gokarna collection, a manuscript of the Baudhaayana 
Shulbasuutradiipikaa (subject of my book, Droz, 2016) that I didn't 
know. Are there also GaNita or Siddhaanta manuscripts available ? I 
mean, through the Muktabodha IRI.
