 I don't think so, but I could be wrong. There are three collections in the
Muktabodha digital library with easily searchable indexes.
1) The vedic manuscripts from Gokarna
2) The Shaiva-siddhanta paper transcripts from the IFP/EFEO in Pondicherry
3) A searchable etext library of tantric manuscripts

All three accessable from https://etexts.muktabodha.org/digital_library.htm
