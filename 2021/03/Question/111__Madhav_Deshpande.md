Does anyone have a pdf of Harry Falk's “The Creation and Spread of Scripts
in Ancient India.” (ed.) Kolb A., Literacy in Ancient Everyday Life,  pp.
43–66. De Gruyter: Berlin. DOI: 10.1515/9783110594065-004.)? I don't have
access to this publication and would like to read it. Please share with me,
if you have it. Thanks.
