Subject: .pdf article request (item by Hélène Brunner)

Dear Colleagues,

Might I be able to lean on one of you to send a .pdf/digital copy of the following article?  I have tried my university library and the other usual digital resources to no avail.

Brunner, H., ‘Le sādhaka, personnage oublié du śivaïsme du sud’,  Journal Asiatique, pp. 411-43 (1975).

Thank you.

Sincerely,
John
