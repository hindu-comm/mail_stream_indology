Dear Mark,

     This divergence goes back to the Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyika [rule
1.1.10] which reads: *prathamāntāni tr̥tīyāntānīti Śaunakasya pratijñānaṃ n*
a* vr̥ttiḥ*, "It is a precept of Śaunaka that the words [*padas*] ending in
the first members of the stop-series, i.e. voiceless unaspirated stops,
should rather end in the third members, i.e. voiced unaspirated stops. Such
however, is not the recitational practice." [HOS 52]. So, should a pada end
as *tat *or *tad* seems to have been a very long debate. The practice of
the Śaunakīya-Atharvaveda Padapāṭha, as noted in the Atharva-Prātiśākhya
reads: *tat iti takārāntaṃ Śaunake*.  This is also the case in the
manuscripts of the Padapāṭha and Jaṭāpāṭha that I used for my edition in
the *Recitational Permutations of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda *[HOS 61].
Such is also the practice of the RV Padapāṭha. But as the rule in the
Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā shows, there was a dispute among different
scholars about this.
