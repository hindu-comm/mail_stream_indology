Noteworthily,  the Rūpāvatāra and the Siddharūpa  (a simple list of paradigms based on the former), which clearly distinct nominal stems ("originally") in -t or -d, place the pronominal stems (tac-/yac-/etac-chabda) just after the -d stems (da-kārānta) not after the -t stems.

Such however, is not the recitational practice." [HOS 52]. So, should a pada end as tat or tad seems to have been a very long debate. The practice of the Śaunakīya-Atharvaveda Padapāṭha, as noted in the Atharva-Prātiśākhya reads: tat iti takārāntaṃ Śaunake.  This is also the case in the manuscripts of the Padapāṭha and Jaṭāpāṭha that I used for my edition in the Recitational Permutations of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda [HOS 61].  Such is also the practice of the RV Padapāṭha. But as the rule in the Śaunakīya-Caturādhyāyikā shows, there was a dispute among different scholars about this.
