Dear Antonia,

*-ōt seems to be the standard assumption, so for instance in the
declension tables in Meier-Brügger’s Einführung § 311 and Sihler’s
Comparative Grammar § 255 (variant *-āt), though then in his
discussion in § 257 Sihler has “*-t (? or *-d) preceded by a long
vowel.” He adduces Hittite instr. -at, abl. -az(a) < *-ati, and
does seem to consider Sabellian *-ōd as secondary, namely from
“**-o-Vt.”

Macdonell, Kale and Whitney presumably just chose the Sanskrit
sandhi forms that corresponded to their understanding of the
Indo-European background of the nominative and ablative.

All best,
Stefan
