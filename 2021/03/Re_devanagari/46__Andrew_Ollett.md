Dear Patrick,

I too was wondering about this a while back, and received the following two
references from Professor Oskar von Hinüber, which I pass on to the list
because they may be of more general interest:

J. F. Blumhardt: Catalogue of the Gujarati and Rajasthani Manuscripts in
the India Office Library. London1954, S.6 on the name devanagari. (
https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001173373)

Walter H. Maurer: On the name devanāgarī , JAOS 96.1976, S. 101-104 (
https://www.jstor.org/stable/599893)


>From these it appears that the earliest attestation of the name is in 1731,
when La Croze
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturin_Veyssi%C3%A8re_La_Croze> mentioned
"Devanagari" as an alternative to "Nagari" in a letter to Theophilus Bayer,
where he describes it as "the character used by Bramans," in contrast to
Balabande (Balabodha), "the character used by the Marathas." (This is
presumably printed in La Croze's correspondence, *Thesaurus Epistolicus
Lacrozianus*, but I haven't tracked it down there. Blumhardt has a very
brief reference on p. 6.) This is older than the reference Maurer gives,
viz. to Halhed's *Code of Gentoo Laws* in 1776. La Croze must have based
his information on books or manuscripts in Berlin.

I have not so far seen any explanation of the name, or any sources (Indian
or European) prior to 1731 where it is used.
