Dear Indology colleagues--
I’m thrilled to be launching Sensing the Sacred <https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/news/podcasts>  a new podcast from the Center for Contemporary South Asia at the Watson Institute at Brown University. We’ll be hosting interdisciplinary conversations with colleagues about their latest work at the intersection of South Asian religion, politics, and society. Our debut episode is a conversation with political scientist Ashutosh Varshney about religion, violence, and Hindu nationalism.

Stay tuned <https://anchor.fm/finnian-m-moore-gerety> for new episodes in weeks to come.

Yours,

Finnian M.M. Gerety
Visiting Assistant Professor of Religious Studies
[Affiliated] Faculty of Contemplative Studies and Center for Contemporary South Asia
