Dear Colleagues,

Professor Lynna Dhanani and I are delighted to announce the establishment
of two graduate prizes on Jainism by the Department of Religious Studies at
UC Davis.

The formal call for submission will come out in Fall 2021 with the
inaugural prize winners announced in Spring 2022. This will be posted on
the department's website and will be shared with the academic community.

You can read about the prizes here

Best,
Archana
