Dear Herman,

in Piṅkalam 3133, we obtain some (incomplete) information concerning the 
polysemy of āmpal.

இசையின் குழலுங் கள்ளு மூங்கிலு
மல்லியும் யானையு மாம்ப லாகும்.

icaiyiṉ kuḻaluṅ kaḷḷu mūṅkilu
malliyum yāṉaiyu māmpa lākum.

Modern editors extract these items,
as representing 5 meanings of āmpal

icaiyiṉ kuḻal --> icaikkuḻal
kaḷ
mūṅkil
alli
yāṉai

The need for the specifier icai in icaiyiṉ kuḻal (replaced by icaikkuḻal 
in the modern gloss) comes from the fact that kuḻal itself is polysemic, 
as explained by Piṅkalam 3407

இருபான் மயிரு மிசையின் கருவியுந்
தொளையுடைப் பொருளுங் குழலென் றாகும்.

irupāṉ mayiru micaiyiṉ karuviyun
toḷaiyuṭaip poruḷuṅ kuḻaleṉ ṟākum.

Modern editors extract these items,
as representing 4 meanings of kuḻal

irupāṉ mayir --> āṇ mayir & peṇ mayir
icaiyiṉ karuvi --> icaik karuvi
toḷaiyuṭaip poruḷ


On the basis of this, I would understand that Piṅkalam 3133 (if 
completed by Piṅkalam 3407) enumerates 5 meanings for āmpal
-- musical instrument
-- toddy (if MTL interpretes Piṅ. correctly)
-- bamboo
-- Water-lily, nymphaea lotus; (if MTL interpretes Piṅ. correctly)
-- elephant

That leaves out 6 of the meanings given by the MTL (on p. 233)

ஆம்பல் āmpal , n. 1. [K. ābal, M. Tu. āmbal.] Water-lily, nymphaea lotus; 
அல்லி. (பிங்.) 2. Musical pipe. See ஆம்பற்குழல். ஆம்பலந் தீங் குழற் றெள்விளி பயிற்ற 
(குறிஞ்சிப். 222). 3. A melody-type played on a pipe; பண்வகை. (சீவக. 1314.) 
4. Bamboo; மூங்கில். (பிங்.) 5. Blow-horn; ஊதுகொம்பு. (திவா.) 6. Elephant; 
யானை. ஆம்பன்முக வரக்கன் (கல்லா. கணபதிகாப்பு). 7. Toddy; கள். (பிங்.) 8. A very 
high number; ஒரு பே ரெண். (தொல். எழுத். 393.) 9. Affliction; துன்பம். (சூடா.) 
10. Arrangement, order; அடைவு. (திவா.) 11. Moon; சந்திரன். (அக. நி.)

As for the 2nd meaning in MTL, namely "Musical pipe",
another MTL entry gives more details

ஆம்பற்குழல் āmpaṟ-kuḻal , n. < ஆம்பல் +. Musical pipe of bell-metal with a 
handle in the shape of a water-lily; குமுரவடிவாக அணைசு பண்ணிச்செறித்த 
ஓரிசைக்குழல். (சிலப். 17, பாட்டு, 2, உரை.)

The meanings left out are

3. a melody-type played on a pipe
5.
8. A very high number;
9.
10.
11.

In Piṅkalam 3024, THREE synonyms are given for kumutam.

They are:
-- āmpal
-- neytal
-- alli

kumutam is mentionned in the Piṅkalam section on Big numbers,
and more precisely it appears in Piṅkalam 1655 & 1656

Regarding meaning 3.
in his 2010 Tamiḻicaip Pērakarāti,
Nā. Mammatu has written that
the melody-type which is intended is
a pentatonic paṇ also called cutta taṉyāci

Therefore,
maybe your interpretation
« (floods) which make a loud noise (āmpal) produced by waterfalls 
([v]aruvi) »
  can be slightly modified
and become

"the pentatonic melody produced by the cascade which has been tuned in 
śuddhadhanyāsi"


According to Walther Kaufmann 1976, page 311,

The ascending sequence is: Do, Mi bémol, Fa, Sol, Si bémol, Sol, Do
The descending sequence is: Do, Si bémol, Sol, Fa, Mi bémol, Do


In Paris, near the Porte de la Villette, inside a park, there is a 
spherical cinema theater called La Géode

https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Géode

If you walk near it at night, you can probably still hear a (random) 
music of a similar nature. I have not verified whether it is pentatonic 
but it is partly linked with the sound of water

Of course one can also visit more than one sphere and listen to big 
numbers in that manner and perceive "La musique des sphères"
:-)

with my best wishes


-- Jean-Luc (in Müssen)
