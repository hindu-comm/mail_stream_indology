Dear friends,
I have the following scan of the Adyar edition of Amarakosha with three
southern commentaries, but it ends abruptly at page number 328.
https://archive.org/download/amarakoshavol1adyar_963__/Amarakosha%20Vol1%20Adyar.pdf

If any one of you have and can share a complete scan on list / off list,
which covers pages 329 to 648, I would be grateful.
