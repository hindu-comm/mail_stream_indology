Dear Colleagues,

My University library does not have the following article, which I would very much like to read. If anyone has a pdf of it, I would be very grateful, if they would share it with me.

Kalyanov, V. I., 'On Krsna's diplomatics in the Mahābhārata', Indologica Taurinensia, Vol. 7, 1979, 299–308. 

Best,

James Hegarty
Cardiff University
