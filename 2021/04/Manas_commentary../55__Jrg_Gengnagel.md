Dear Santosh,

nice to see that you are working on काष्ठजिह्व स्वामी!

I do have a copy of the "Pañcakrośa Sudhā" and did quickly check my 
notes. The printed text gives "iti vidyāraṇyatīrthakṛtā 
pañcakrośasudhā (Pañcakrośa Sudhā: 111). Both the
publisher of the Pañcakrośa Sudhā as well as Upādhyāya (1994: 800), 
however, give Kāṣṭ
hajihva Svāmī as the author of the text, although 
Vidyāraṇyatīrtha is given as name of his dīkṣāguru (Upādhyāya 1994: 793).

In case the "Pañcakrośa Sudhā" is of interest, I could try to get it 
scanned.

Best

Joerg
