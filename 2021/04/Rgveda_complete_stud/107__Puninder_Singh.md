The "convenient assignment of authority to oneself" has been a central
conceit of colonizers for quite some time, not just self-proclaimed
"insiders".

This conceit is still deployed on a daily basis, for example, within
contemporary settler colonial societies to undermine indigenous claims
to their own knowledge systems, along with their claims to land,
artifacts, remains, and other forms of intangible heritage.

Most readers here would agree that attempts to reduce phenomena to
simplistic typologies are of limited use. However, careful work,
informed by nuance and subtlety, is still useful.
