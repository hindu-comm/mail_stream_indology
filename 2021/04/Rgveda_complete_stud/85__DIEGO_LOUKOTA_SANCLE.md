  Dear Veeranarayana,

  Prof. Jamison is publishing her commentary online in the following
website:

http://rigvedacommentary.alc.ucla.edu/

  The commentary is work in progress, but eventually it should cover the
entire text and substantial sections are finished already. I hope this
helps!.

  *namaskaromi*,

  Diego
