> This "Indian" does not include "westernized Indian" but often includes
"Indianized westerners."

If "Indian" includes "Indianized westerners"' and "western" includes
"westernized Indian " then it shows that this classification is not based
on the place of origin of the researcher/scholar but is based on -ization,
a certain approach to the material studied.

The category 'western' as a label for a certain worldview , a certain
approach to understanding things has been used widely in the academic
studies world over.

If there are two approaches to issues they being purvapaksha to each other
is good for the health of academic studies.

Readers too get excited to follow the debate.
