Dear Dominik, dear all,

When Prof. Pandurangi asked about the "western perspective," I supposed
(charitably) that he was asking for outstanding recent representatives of a
tradition of scholarship that is informed by comparative philology,
comparative mythology, historical linguistics, ritual studies, and literary
studies, regardless of whether it is produced in LA, Erlangen, Kyoto, or
Pune. I hope he has received sufficient answers from specialists on this
list.

Now we are no longer talking about a request for information, but the
possible justifications for speaking, in general terms, about the "Western"
and "Indian" approaches, and as Dr. Paturi revealingly said, between
"outsider" and "insider" perspectives. I don't think it's useful to have a
conversation about the possible intellectual justifications for using these
terms. The people who use those terms often, if not always, use them for
other purposes than "doing useful intellectual work," and I trust the
members of the list know precisely the uses to which these terms have been
put in the last, say, five years.

Sorry to spam everyone's inboxes with an opinion rather than useful
information. I hope that all of our friends and colleagues in India are
staying as safe and healthy as they possibly can.

Andrew
