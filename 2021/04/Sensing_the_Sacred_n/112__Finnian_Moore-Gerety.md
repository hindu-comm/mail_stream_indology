Dear colleagues—
I’d like to draw your attention to three new episodes of Sensing the Sacred <https://anchor.fm/finnian-m-moore-gerety>, a podcast on South Asian Religions from the Center for Contemporary South Asia <https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/news/podcasts> at Brown University. 

Episode 2: Islam and Political Imagination in Early Modern Afghanistan with Tanvir Ahmed (Brown University)
Episode 3: Hindu Street Shrines with Borayin Larios (University of Vienna)
Episode 4: Mantras, Healing and Tantra in Jainism with Ellen Gough (Emory University)

I hope you enjoy these interdisciplinary conversations. We’ll be releasing more episodes in May. 

Yours,
Finnian
