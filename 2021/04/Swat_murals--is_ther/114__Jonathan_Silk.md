Dear Friends

I noticed the following link on Dan Martin's wonderful Tibeto-logic blog:
https://www.dawn.com/news/amp/1606050

When i googled around, what I found is that (actual reporters being extinct
apparently) everything seems to have evidently simply copied a press
release, so we find the same thing in virtually the same words, but so far
i have not been able to learn more about what seems to be an intriguing
find: Kushan era murals from Swat.
Does anyone know more?

Jonathan
