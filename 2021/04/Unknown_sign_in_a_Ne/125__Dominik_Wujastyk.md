I am looking for help with these signs that I'm seeing in the
fifteenth-century Nepalese MS,  MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333
<https://www.panditproject.org/entity/102310/manuscript>:

and

Here, the surrounding word is pāke

These symbols are not letters, since they don't contribute to the
surrounding text, but interrupt it.  I have wondered whether they are the
scribe expressing that his archetype has a string-hole at this place,
perhaps, but I don't see the symbols often enough for that.  They occur
rather rarely.

Has anyone seen these?

Best,
Dominik
