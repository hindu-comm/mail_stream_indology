The book certainly exists!  A (currently) working URL for it is this:

https://www.austriaca.at/7865-1?frames=yes

You should be able to download at least parts of it there.
Unfortunately, the link “Order Print Edition” isn’t working there
either.  Perhaps it would be best to contact the publisher directly, at
mailto:verlag at oeaw.ac.at ; I’m sure they will be happy to provide a
copy.

With best wishes,
