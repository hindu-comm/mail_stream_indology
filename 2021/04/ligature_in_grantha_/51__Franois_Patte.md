Thank you for your answer.

It is a manuscript in French written by a Tamil who was the interpreter 
of  the french king in Pondicherry in the years 1770/1790.

It is a memoir on the astronomy in use at that time on the Coromandel 
coast. He was a christian and the french astronomer Le Gentil describes 
him as a very learned person knowing Sanskrit, Latin and Greek and (of 
course) French.

In this memoir, he gives words and quotations in Tamil, written in tamil 
script and in Sanskrit, written in grantha script. There are several 
non-standard ligatures, the one I already sent, and others I attach to 
this mail.

I am wondering if these ligatures are local variants or if the author 
did not know very well the rules of grantha script.

I have also a question about the vowell "u" which is written like a  "ṛ" 
(or a "i"?). I give some exemples in the attached file.

I think that it is a "u" instead of a "ṛ" because he give the full text 
of the Vararuci's vākya and I can compare with the edition of these 
vākya given in the Haricarita edited by Pandit Krishnamacarya.

For this problem, I am wondering if it a variant in the script or a 
mistake due to the pronunciation of the vowell "ṛ" wich is pronounced 
like a "ru" in some parts of India. For instance, in this text, the 
author call the Sanskrit, the "sanskroutam".

Thank you and best regards
