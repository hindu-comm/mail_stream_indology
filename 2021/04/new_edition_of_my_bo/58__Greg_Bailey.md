Dear List,

I am pleased to announce the publication of the second edition of my book, The Mythology of BrahmƒÅ. It was first published in 1983 and has been substantially revised in the light of new scholarship. It has been published by Motilal Banarsidass in New Delhi, who can be contacted at

Cheers,

Greg Bailey
