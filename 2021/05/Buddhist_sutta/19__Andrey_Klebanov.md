The Suśrutasaṃhitā (Sū 3.12) has another verse of the kind:

sūcanāt sūtraṇāc caiva savanāc cārthasantateḥ /
ṣaṭcatvāriṃśadadhyāyaṃ sūtrasthānaṃ pracakṣate //

The old Nepalese transmission of the text reads “sādhanāc cārthasantateḥ“ in pāda b.

best,
Andrey

> Aleksandar, it depends on whether one wants to restrict the use of ‘indicated (meaning)’ to lakṣita/lakṣaṇā. I would think there are other, better renderings available for the latter when it is contrasted with abhidhā: ‘indirect’, ‘figurative’, ‘suggestive’, etc., vs. ‘direct’, ‘literal’. I realize that ‘indicate’ is within the range of meanings of forms of lakṣ- (in the basic sense of ‘target, thing aimed at’), but to my ear ‘indicate’ leans more to directness (lit., ‘pointing to’), and thus accords well with the “pointy” directness of sūc-.

> Matthew, you say: “Once more, SŪC, and nothing to do with thread, …” But we should remember that sūc- is also (indeed, most literally) connected with piercing (with a needle) and sewing. Sūcī/sūcaka = needle, sūcita = pierced, sūcika = tailor, sūcitā = needlework.

What would you (the forum) suggest?
