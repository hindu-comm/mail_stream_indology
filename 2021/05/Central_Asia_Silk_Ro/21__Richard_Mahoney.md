Dear Paolo,

Chunghui Tsui put together a map for Northern Liang stupas, you might
find it helpful. See fig. 40, p. 97:

Tsui, Chung-hui 崔中慧 (2020) Chinese Calligraphy and Early Buddhist
Manuscripts. Oxford: Indica et Buddhica.

A PDF can be downloaded from here:

Best, Richard

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Central Asia/Silk Roads Maps

Dear Indologists,

Maybe someone can help me. I need a few maps of Silk Roads and Eastern
and Western Central Asia Buddhist centres. Do you know any website
where I can find good quality maps or can you submit any scan of 2-3
maps of this geographical area?

Best wishes,
Paolo
