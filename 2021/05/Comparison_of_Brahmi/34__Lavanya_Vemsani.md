Thank you Caley, 
I always find Indology-L discussions stimulating, this is more so with your discussion and the shared paper. It brought fond memories of reading the book, Beyond Orality, as part of a seminar class and our contested discussions, in that seminar at McMaster many years ago. 
Looking forward to reading your book. 
Thank you. 
Lavanya
