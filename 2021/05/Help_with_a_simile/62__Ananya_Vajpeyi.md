udghāṭayet kapāṭaṃ tu yathā kuñcikayā haṭhāt |
kuṇḍalinyā tathā yogī mokṣadvāraṃ vibhedayet ||

Just as one might throw open the palace gates by forcibly turning the key,
So must a yogī break open the portals of mokṣa with the force / power of
his (awakened) kuṇḍalinī.

Jim I think haṭhāt here is like Hindi "zor se", and kapāṭa is like kivāḍ (a
baḍā, bhārī double darvāzā). It's just easier in Hindi:

जिस तरह कोई चाबी को ज़ोर से घुमाकर घर (या महल) के किवाड़ खोलता है
उसी तरह योगी अपनी कुण्डलिनी शक्ति के प्रभाव से मोक्ष के द्वार खोल पाता है

I trust you are on the very verge of what the verse describes... the
kuṇḍalinī is key, so to speak.

Yours,

AV.
