Dear Jim,

I was just looking at this verse recently when considering different definitions of haṭha and I wonder whether perhaps the verbs are the issue rather than the simile? I’m sure you probably know more about this than I do, but it seems to me that once the kuṇḍalinī is awakened (which I know can take some force) it should actually arise quite easily like a key unlocks a door?

Best wishes,
Zoë

A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this kuñcikā and kapāṭa might be. I am aware that a kapāṭa is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the kuñcikā? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.
