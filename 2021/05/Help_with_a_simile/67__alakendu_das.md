Dr.Mallimson,I find "Kunchika" may be loosely translated as "Ripper" i.e a tool to rip open something.
Alakendu Das.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Help with a simile

  Dear colleagues,I wonder if anybody can help me understand a simile in a haṭhayoga text I’m editing, the Vivekamārtaṇḍa. Verse 34 reads:udghāṭayet kapāṭaṃ tu yathā kuñcikayā haṭhāt |kuṇḍalinyā tathā yogī mokṣadvāraṃ vibhedayet ||My incomplete translation is as follows: “The yogi should use Kuṇḍalinī to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a kuñcikā to force open a kapāṭa.” I had been translating kuñcikā as “key” and kapāṭa as “door”, but this isn’t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this kuñcikā and kapāṭa might be. I am aware that a kapāṭa is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the kuñcikā? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.All the best,Jim
