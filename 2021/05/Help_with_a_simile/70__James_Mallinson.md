Many thanks indeed to Jonathan Silk from whom I have received the needful.

All the best,

Because of these usages, and the suggestions from colleagues that udghāṭayet and vibhedayet might have subtly different meanings in the Vivekamārtaṇḍa verse, I now suspect that udghāṭayet is being used in the sense of “unlock”. And that haṭhāt, as some colleagues suggested, gives a sense of certainty or inevitability. (By the way, I should have noted that the Vivekamārtaṇḍa does not call its yoga haṭha, so it is unlikely that there is any connotation of a particular type of yoga in haṭhāt.)

Basically, with the right kuñjī, you can "crack" an entrance exam. I realize that the door-key-opening-breaking through metaphor is continuing here, from kuṇḍalinī yoga to the IIT qualifying test, which yields its own version of mokṣa for the successful candidates. And certainly getting through such ordeals to breach the portals of these vaunted institutions -- engineering / medical / architecture / management / law colleges -- requires a certain haṭha, determination, force, effort, discipline, rigour, zor-zabardastī!

>> udghāṭayet kapāṭaṃ tu yathā kuñcikayā haṭhāt |
>> kuṇḍalinyā tathā yogī mokṣadvāraṃ vibhedayet ||

>> My incomplete translation is as follows: “The yogi should use Kuṇḍalinī to break open the doorway to liberation in the same way that one might use a kuñcikā to force open a kapāṭa.” I had been translating kuñcikā as “key” and kapāṭa as “door”, but this isn’t altogether satisfactory. A key does not force a door to open. But I am unable to think of what this kuñcikā and kapāṭa might be. I am aware that a kapāṭa is usually a double door (I think of saloon doors in cowboy films) but what then is the kuñcikā? Of course it is quite possible that it is just a rather sloppy simile.
