Dear colleagues:

I wanted to ask if there have been any studies on the use of
rhetorical questions in Sanskrit texts, particularly, in passages that
critique different positions. My question stems from an observation in
astronomical texts (*siddhānta*s) where author often criticise each other
(or *purāṇic* views) using rhetorical questions. Any resource (articles,
books, citations, etc.) on this topic would be greatly appreciated. Many
thanks.

With kind regards,
AJ
