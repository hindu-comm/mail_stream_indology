Subject: [INDOLOGY] PDF request Schmidt Ueber das Mahayana und Pratschna-Paramita

Dear All,
I am looking for a PDF of Isaak Jacob Schmidt’s article “Ueber das Mahayana und Pratschna-Paramita.” Burnouf mentions this on  p. 530 of his Introduction a l’histoire du buddhism indien as published in “Mem. De l’Acad. des sciences de S. Petersbourg, t. 4, p. 202ff”, but I have been unable to find it.
Best,
