Dear all,

Some colleagues in India brought to our attention that Padmanabh S. Jaini, one of the greatest scholars of Jainism (and Buddhism), and professor at Berkeley, has passed away at the age of 97.
For an article on the publication of his memoirs: https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/a-world-of-learning-the-journey-of-padmanabh-jaini/cid/1686901

In 1998, while teaching at the University of California at Berkeley, I befriended a scholar much older and far more learned than I. This was Padmanabh Jaini, a great authority on Buddhism and Jainism, with a profound knowledge of texts in half a dozen languages.
