Dear Colleagues,

I would like to bring the following news to the attention of those of you,
who have a stake in the continued existence of Indian Studies in Germany:

A few days ago, the rectorate of the University of Halle adopted -
completely unexpectedly - a cutback plan to eliminate a whole number of
departments. Among them is the study of India in both its historical and
contemporary aspects.  Two professorships for these areas had already been
released for re-filling. The announcement for the two positions was
expected this summer semester.

There is a massive protest inside and outside the university against the
planned permanent closure of, among others, the programs in Greek, Latin,
Indology, Japanese Studies, South Asian Languages and Cultures, Near
Eastern Archaeology, Political Sciences as well as the Department of
Classics and the Department of Sports Science.

If you would like to join the protest and support the process of filling
the vacancies, please sign the petition below of the Student Council of the
Faculty of Humanities. Already on Wednesday this week the Academic Senate
will discuss this decision of the Rectorate. There is therefore a certain
urgency in this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Walter Slaje
