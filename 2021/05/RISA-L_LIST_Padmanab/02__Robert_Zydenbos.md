P.S. Jaini's demise is a very sad loss for the scholarly community. I 
remember how I was in Ahmedabad when his book _The Jaina Path of 
Purification_ appeared. Pt. Dalsukhbhai Malvania had a pre-publication 
copy of the book and showed it to me when I visited him at his home; 
Malvania said this is a book everybody should read. Now, more than forty 
years later, there still is no better introductory book to Jaina thought 
in a western language. It is the obvious book which I recommend to my 
students.

The first time I spoke with Padmanābhanavaru was on the occasion of a 
conference in Toronto, more than 25 years ago. I must admit that I 
enjoyed the shock on his face when I told him in Kannada that I knew 
where he was from, that his mother was a well-known Jaina author, and 
that I knew all the leading Jaina clergy in his native region who told 
anecdotes about him. Unfortunately not many more such occasions for 
meeting followed, but I remember them all as cordial and beneficial.

He will be sorely missed. Another scholar of a great generation has left 
us.
