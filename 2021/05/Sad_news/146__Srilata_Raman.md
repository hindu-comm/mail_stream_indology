The world of Śrīvaiṣṇavism has lost a really remarkable person of the saṃpradāya, brilliant, deeply curious, very learned and yet open to thinking in critical ways about the tradition, always helpful and with a wonderful sense of humour. I knew him very well in his Melkote days and cherished his many sterling qualities. It is a very sad day indeed.

Srilata Raman,

Dear Indology list,

I was sorry to learn today of the sad demise of Pr. Laksmi Thathachar<http://tamil.sampspeak.in/2021/05/tributes-to-sri-u-ve-lakshmi-thathachar.html?m=1>, former Director of the Academy of Sanskrit Research in Melkote.
As an early investigator of computerized śabdabodha, he was a founding father of Sanskrit computational linguistics.
