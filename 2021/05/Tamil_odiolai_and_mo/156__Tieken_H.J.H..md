Dear List Members,

I was reading an article on the casting of bronze images in Tamilnadu. The author, apparently unfamiliar with written Tamil, mentions a flexible tape line called odiolai. The second part is ōlai, "palmleaf". But what is the first part?

In the same context mention is made of a mollakkol, the last part of which is most probably kōl, "yardstick". But here too: what is the first part? I hope someone will be able to tell me what to make of odi and molla.

Kind regards, Herman
