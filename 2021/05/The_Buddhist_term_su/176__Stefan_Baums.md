Dear Caley,

> In an oral tradition you will never encounter a "dead text" like
> a book that merely contains information

on that note, Ñāṇamoli in his translations of the Nettippakaraṇa
and Peṭakopadesa (two Pali texts not unrelated to the Gāndhārī
exegetical tradition) renders sutta as “Thread, Thread-of-Argument
(presenting the Buddha’s teaching).” George Bond has also written
extensively about the method of the Nettippakaraṇa in particular
(and the view of sutta embodied in in it).

All best,
Stefan
