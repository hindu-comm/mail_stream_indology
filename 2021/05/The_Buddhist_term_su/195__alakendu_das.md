Dr.Ryan
While referring to a traditional book written in Bengali, by Dr.Biman Chandra Bhattacharya ( first publication 1958), the name of which loosely translates as 'Outlines of Sanskrit literature' , I find , the word "Sutta" in Buddhist literature is an abridged version of the word "Sutra" in Sanskrit, but the implied meaning has some difference in it.In Sanskrit, by "Sutra" we mean a subtle "thread "of discourse by which the subject matter is gradually elaborated, whereas in Buddhist literature "Sutta"means a discourse in a wider context.Alakendu Das.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] The Buddhist term sutta

  Dear all,
Sheldon Pollock in The Language of the Gods in the World of Men (p. 52) suggests that the Buddhist term “sutta” does not derive from the Sanskrit sūtra,but rather from sūkta. Sanskrit double consonant clusters do show regular assimilation, regressively and progressively, in Prakrit, where two different consonants become a double of one of them. I’m interested in hearing learned opinion on Pollock’s suggestion. I had not noticed this interesting detail, when I first read this book some years ago.
