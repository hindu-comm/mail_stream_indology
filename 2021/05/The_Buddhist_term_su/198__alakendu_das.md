Dr.Dieter Schlingloff,
Is your book anyway available with an English version? Even a PDF copy of those particular pgs 536-551 would be of immense help to me.

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] The Buddhist term sutta






    Dear all,
    in an article in ZDMG 113, 1964, Zur
        Interpretation des Pratimoksasutra, p.536-51 , I have given
      proofs for the thesis, that the Buddhist Pratimoksasutra
      (in its oldest form) is the earliest Buddhist text at all. This
      text is a real thread, a guide to korrekt behaviour for
      Buddhist monks. From this guide book, the term was taken over to
      the following texts concerned with teaching, the Buddhist suttas.
    Best greetings, Dieter Schlingloff.
