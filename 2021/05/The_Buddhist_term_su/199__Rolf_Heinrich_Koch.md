>> Hi everyone,
>>
>> I am reminded by Professor Paul Dundas of a few other points that 
>> might be relevant to this discussion:
>>
>>   * Paul Dundas (“Somnolent Sūtras: Scriptural Commentary in
>>     Śvetāmbara Jainism," /Journal of Indian Philosophy/24: 73–101,
>>     1996) says the following (p. 78: see the notes for the sources):
>>       o The Jain position with regard to scripture and commentary
>>         upon it,of whatever type or period, is strongly predicated
>>         upon the acceptanceof meaning as being superior to word.
>>         This can be seen clearly fromthe standard Jain etymology for
>>         the term “sūtra” which would deriveit from the root sūc,
>>         “indicate.” A sūtra “indicates” many meaningswhich the
>>         teacher explicates through commentary, obtaining the
>>         sensefrom the root text in the same manner as a potter
>>         creates shapes from alump of clay.
>>   * Mari Jvyärsjärvi (“Retrieving the Hidden Meaning: Jain
>>     Commentarial Techniques and the Art of Memory,” /Journal of
>>     Indian Philosophy /38.2: 133–162, 2010), cites Saṅghadāsa’s
>>     commentary on the /Br̥hatkalpa /(p. 138):
>>       o Sutra [becomes sutta] just like supta; or sūtra has a double
>>         meaning [ 'sūtra isa thread']. Or it becomes sutta because
>>         it indicates [sūcana] the meaning, or iswell-spoken
>>         [sūkta].These are its etymologies: it 'indicates' or it
>>         'sews,' or also 'it is produced,' or'it follows.' These are
>>         the divisions [of etymology], and these are its names.Sūtra
>>         is like a person who is slumbering: unless it is "awakened"
>>         by meaning,
>>         it cannot be known. Or due to the similarity in [words that
>>         have] doublemeanings, many meanings are joined together.A
>>         needle, even when broken, can be traced by the thread as long
>>         as it isthreaded. Likewise meaning [is pointed out] by the
>>         sūtra. It 'sews together'words and meanings like a thread
>>         [sews together] jackets and so on.13
>>   * The name of one of the older texts in the Śvētāmbara canon,
>>     Sūyagaḍa-, is often rendered as Sūtrakr̥ta-, but the first part
>>     doesn't correspond to the usual development of the Old Indic word
>>     sūtra-. Willem Bollée suggested that it might come from
>>     *sūca-kr̥ta- or *sūca-gata- (in his glossary to /Studien zum
>>     Sūyagaḍa/, vol. 1, p. 197). Compare the Sanskrit word /sūcā/.
