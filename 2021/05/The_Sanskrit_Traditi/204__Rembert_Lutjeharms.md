*37th Annual Sanskrit Tradition in the Modern World Symposium*

Friday 28 May 2021

We warmly invite you to the 37th Sanskrit Tradition in the Modern World
symposium, which will be held online, hosted by the Oxford Centre for Hindu
Studies.

Sanskrit Traditions in the Modern World (STIMW) is a forum for the
discussion of the Sanskrit traditions of South Asia, and the texts and
cultures that have risen out of them. It brings together established and
rising academics for the focused examination of research pertaining to
various aspects of South Asia’s rich Sanskrit religious and intellectual
culture. It thereby seeks to sustain and build upon the long history of
scholarship in this important area of study.

This year's symposium will feature the following papers:

Ruth Westoby, SOAS University of London
*‘Uncoiling a concept: Kuṇḍalinī in the early Haṭhacorpus’ *
(Discussant: Jason Birch)

C. T. Fleming, University of Oxford
*‘Dharmaśāstra in the Ayodhya Verdict (2019)’* (Discussant: Jacqueline
Hirst)

Rebecca Manring, Indiana University
*‘Hanumān's Leaps of Faith: Intertextuality in the Dharma-maṅgala’
*(Discussant:
Ishan Chakrabarty)

Elena Mucciarelli, University of Groningen & Adheesh Sathaye, University of
British Columbia
*‘Transcreating Sanskrit Humour through Kutiyattam Performance’ *(Discussant:
Mandakranta Bose)

There is no registration fee. But if you would like to attend, please
