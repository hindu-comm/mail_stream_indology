Dear colleagues,


I am looking for evidence of burial practices in Ancient India - especially for those whose corpses might be deemed too polluting or dangerous (due to sickness).


Parry describes immersing those who died of Smallpox instead of cremation (because Sitala inhabits the body). But is there any evidence of whole bodies (in other words, uncremated bodies) being buried instead?


Looking forward to hearing your answers.

Best wishes,


Vanessa R. Sasson
