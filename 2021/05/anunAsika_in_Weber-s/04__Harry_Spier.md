Dear list members,
The anunāsika as printed  in Weber's edition of Śatapatha-brahmaṇa in
Madhyandina-śakha is similar but slightly different from the versions
of  anunāsika/anusvara
in the Unicode  Vedic Extensions block.  Can someone identify which
character in the Unicode Vedic Extensions block the  anunāsika in Weber's
Śatapatha-brahmaṇa corresponds to.  See attached pdf.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
