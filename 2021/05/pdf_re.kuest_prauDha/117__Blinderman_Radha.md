Dear All,

Does anyone of you have a pdf of the entire *Prauḍhamanoramā*, especially
beyond the *avyayībhāvaprakaraṇa*? I have access to several scans ending
with the *avyayībhāva *section, but cannot find the remaining sections. I
would be very grateful if you could share it with me.

आदरपूर्वकं भवदीया,
राधिका
