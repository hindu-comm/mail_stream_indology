I was wondering if those specialists in yoga on the list might know the origin of this definition of prāṇāyāma found in Bhaṭṭotpala’s commentary to Bṛhatsaṃhitā 95/97.62 in connection with the practice of warding off the effects of bad omens:

savyāhṛtiṃ sapraṇavāṃ gāyatrīśirasā saha/

triḥ paṭhed āyataprāṇaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ sa ucyate//

Many thanks in advance, 
Best,
Ken
