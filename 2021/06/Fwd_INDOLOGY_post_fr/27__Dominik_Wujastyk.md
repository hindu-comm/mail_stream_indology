Subject: Devanagari QWERTY keyboard for Windows 10?

Please help me with how to get a Devanagari QWERTY keyboard for Windows
10.  The keyboards that Windows installs for Marathi and Sanskrit and not
QWERTY keyboards. Previously I had the Devanagari QWERTY keyboard prepared
by the University of British Columbia on my machine, but now Windows 10
will not allow installing that keyboard. Any help would be appreciated.
With best regards,
