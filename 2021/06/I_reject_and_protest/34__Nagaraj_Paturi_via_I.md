Dear Patrick,

Thanks for clarifying that your acknowledgements were to my conversations
with you in this forum and that occasionally continued as
individual correspondence after originating in this forum.

I wish the acknowledgements passage provided this clarity. Afterall, the
name of the forum that provided opportunity for those conversations also
deserves acknowledgement.

More significantly that provides the full context to the reader by helping
them know where and through which means (here, email conversation in an
email list) the acknowledged conversations happened.

Thanks also for your good words about my being courteous and you learning
etc. Learning in all such conversations is always mutual. I too learnt a
lot from my conversations with you.

With all such good memory of you , you might also remember that my
conversations with you were quite often based on a difference of opinion,
and even a difference of stance regarding different issues particularly the
issue of focus in the article on hand. Of course, the different stand need
not and did not stop us from being mutually respectful and cordial. My
answering your enquiry about whether FLAME would be a good be place for you
to apply, or my Likedin congratulations on your work anniversaries,
Sanskrit word helps  etc. are all part of this mutual cordiality not
getting affected by difference in stand on issues of research focus or
publications.

It is the missing of this aspect of my different stance with regard to the
issue on focus in the article that leads to a problematic inaccuracy of
documentation. We, the researchers suffering from the lack of proper
documentation in premodern sources that compels us to struggle to  resolve
opposing pictures from different documents mentioning  the same one or more
individuals, should not commit such inaccuracies in these times of improved
documentation norms in research documents. For example, an observer looking
at this acknowledgement passage in this article and my own expressions in
other sources where I express a completely different if not opposite stance
may have to struggle in the same way to resolve the conflict in the two
pictures from the two documents. In fact, it is an intrigued reader who
found such a conflict that brought this academia page to my notice.

I too would not like to continue this conversation any further than just
clarifying the reasons for my expression here in the beginning of this
thread.

Thanks and warm regards,

Nagaraj
