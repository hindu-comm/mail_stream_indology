HARVARD DIVINITY SCHOOL

May 2021

Tenure-Track Position in Hindu Studies

Harvard Divinity School seeks to make a full-time, tenure-track appointment with the rank of assistant professor in Hindu Studies, within the context of the religions of South Asia; and/or Hindu traditions as a global or transnational religion; and/or diasporic Hindu traditions, including Hindu traditions in North America. The foci of applicants’ work may be in any region or time period; research languages, disciplinary and methodological engagements are also open. The search is thus open to a variety of approaches to the field, including the interpretation of texts and commentaries, ritual studies, philosophical and theological studies, the historical study of religion, ethnographic studies, representations of Hindu traditions in film and other media, in South Asia or the global diaspora.

The successful candidate will work closely with students in the Divinity School’s Masters programs, including its multi-religious Master of Divinity program, and be involved with doctoral programs in the Committee on the Study of Religion and related departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Teaching undergraduates in the Comparative Study of Religion and in related FAS departments is also assumed. The successful candidate will be familiar with forms of analysis that address race, gender, and social location.

Candidates must apply online at http://academicpositions.harvard.edu.  The application will include: cover letter; curriculum vitae; statement describing teaching philosophy and practices; research statement; statement describing efforts to encourage diversity, inclusion, and belonging, including past, current, and anticipated future contributions in these areas; and the names of three references whom the School will contact.  Thereafter it will be the responsibility of the candidates to ensure that three references have been uploaded by the referees to their applications.  The search committee will begin the review of completed applications on September 15, 2021, although applications will continue to be accepted until the position is filled.

Letters of nomination are also welcome and should be sent to Dean David N. Hempton at hdsdeansoffice at hds.harvard.edu<mailto:hdsdeansoffice at hds.harvard.edu>. Applicants should address any questions regarding the position itself or the online application system to the HDS Faculty Search Office at hindustudiessearch at hds.harvard.edu<mailto:hindustudiessearch at hds.harvard.edu>.

HDS is an equal opportunity, affirmative-action employer, and encourages applications and nominations of women and/or ethnic minority candidates, and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability status, protected veteran status, pregnancy and pregnancy related conditions, or any other characteristic protected by law.
