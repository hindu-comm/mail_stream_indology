Dear Suchandra,

the manuscript of Jinadāsa's commentary on the Niryukti ( i. e. the 
cūrṇi, 2vols.) you find at

https://jainelibrary.org/list-search/

and search for

Aavashyak_Sutram_Purv_Bhag

Aavashyak_Sutram_Uttar_Bhag

The part which deals with the namokkāra-prayer (Namaskāra-niryukti: vol. 
1) includes many stories. These stories I have translated into German 
some decades ago, An English revision of my doctoral thesis I have sent 
to the L.D. Institute in Ahmedabad about 25 years ago. The plans for 
publishing it in India were never realized.

Best

Heiner
