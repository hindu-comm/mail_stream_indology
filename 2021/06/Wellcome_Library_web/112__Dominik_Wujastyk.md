For decades, the Wellcome Library's online presence has been at
http://wellcomelibrary.org.  Now, that URL automatically redirects to the
Wellcome Collection site with its poor search facility.  Only after some
random poking around does one find one's way to
https://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/, where serious, advanced research
can begin.
