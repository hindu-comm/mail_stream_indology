For decades, the Wellcome Library's online presence has been at
http://wellcomelibrary.org. Now, that URL automatically redirects to
the Wellcome Collection site with its poor search facility. Only
after some random poking around does one find one's way to
https://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/, where serious, advanced
research can begin.
