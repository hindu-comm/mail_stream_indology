Dear Dominik,
That our BA in Sanskrit includes a few courses without Sanskrit requirement
does not disqualify our BA as one in Sanskrit! It definitely focuses on the
Sanskrit language, as is specified on the first page to which I sent a link:

son objet principal est le sanskrit et ses littératures, dont elle met en
évi­dence la richesse: l’apprentissage du sanskrit s’y fait avant tout par
la lecture et la traduction in­tensives de textes appartenant à des genres
très différents (contes, épopée, poésie savante, litté­ra­ture
historiographique, traités philosophiques, traités d’esthétique, etc.).

With all best wishes,
Isabelle
