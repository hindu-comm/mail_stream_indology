Dear Friends,


I have a query about cubits. I know that different lengths for the cubit
measurement exist across time and cultures, though I'm still left with some
doubt about my conversion. Might I be correct in calculating 60 cubits =
27.4 meters (90 feet)?


I came across this figure in the following passage.


“Uggasena appeared; he climbed up a *pole sixty cubits high* made up of
many lengths of bamboo affixed one to the other firmly. He stood on top of
the pole poised to stage a performance.” (vol. 3, p 217) // “Their show
usually started with the appearance on the stage of a young maid, the
daughter of the troupe's leading acrobat. She displayed her skill in
acrobatics in various styles on a string of bamboos at a certain height
from the ground; she moved from end to end gently and steadily, as she
danced and sang with a pleasant voice.” (vol. 3, p 214) Vicittasārābhivaṃsa
et al. (1996, vol. 3, p. 217).

Thank you.
