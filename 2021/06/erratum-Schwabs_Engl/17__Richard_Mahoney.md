Curious, I was just reading that Abel-Rémusat (1788--1832) secured the
first chair in Chinese at the Collège de France, also in 1815;
enviable time.


Best, Richard

Dear colleagues,
I just noticed a typo in my post. Please correct it: Chézy’s chair in
Collège de France was created in 1815.

My very best,

Lyne
