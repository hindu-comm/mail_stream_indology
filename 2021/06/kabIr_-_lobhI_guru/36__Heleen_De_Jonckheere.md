Dear all,

I am looking for intertextual references for the use of ‘lobhī guru’ in the text I am studying by an early-modern Jain Braj author.
Besides a Hindi proverb (lobhi guru lālci celā doū narak meṃ thelam thelā), several popular sources ascribe the following witty verse to Kabīr.
'guru lobhī sikha lālcī donoṃ khele dāṃv. donoṃ bapure būṃdahī caḍhi patthar kī nāv’.
Can anyone tell me where the verse might come from? I could not find it in the Bījak or Millennium Vāṇī.

Thank you very much!
