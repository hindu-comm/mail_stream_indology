Dear list members,

Verse 3 of the Dāridryadahanaśivastotram is:

bhaktipriyāya bhavarogabhayāpahāya

ugrāya durgabhavasāgaratāraṇāya |

jyotirmayāya guṇanāmasunṛtyakāya

dāridryaduḥkhadahanāya namaḥ śivāya ||


I'm having difficulty translating guṇanāma in this verse.  Its been
suggested to me that line 3 might be  jyotirmayāya guṇanāmasu nṛtyakāya
instead of  jyotirmayāya guṇanāmasunṛtyakāya but I haven't found that
attested anywhere. Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
