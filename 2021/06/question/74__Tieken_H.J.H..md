Dear List Members, in some Tamil Vaiṣṇava Bhakti poems Kṣr̥ṇa is said to have split (kīl̥) a bird beak (pul̥l̥iṉ vāy). I remember having once seen a miniature depicting this scene. At present I am in particular interested in the name of the bird – if it has a name. I hope someone can help me with this.
