Dear colleagues,

I am working with my student Marine Schoettel to prepare an edition and translation of a major (14-plate) charter of 15th-century Java, that contains quite a number of Sanskrit stanzas, interspersed between Old Javanese prose passages. Besides the kāvya stanzas of the royal genealogy, that were certainly locally composed, there are some (possibly Indian) dharmaśāstra stanzas at the end of the text, where we read, toward the end of the charter:

yatikomaṅgu(13v4)hakna viparītaniṁ brahmamukhodita saptavr̥ddhi, ndya ta lvirannya //

XXXII. [anuṣṭubh]
    Āyurhānir yyaśohāniḥ, hāniḥ prajñāsukhaśriyāṁ*,
    dharmmasantā(13v5)nahāniś ca, santu te saptahānayaḥ //

We translate:

'They will encounter what are [called] the opposites of the seven gains enunciated orally by Brahmā, as follows: "Loss of vitality, loss of glory, loss of wisdom, happiness, and fortune, loss of dharma and progeny; those shall be the seven losses!" '

I am unable to locate the saptahāni stanza in my e-text corpus. I am hoping that one of you may be able to.

Also, I am unable to find any (relevant) occurrences of the expression saptavr̥ddhi, and am curious if my impression that the Old Javanese is alluding to a text ascribed to Brahmā can somehow be confirmed from the Sanskrit tradition.

Thank you.

Arlo Griffiths
