Greetings all,

A colleague who wishes to remain anonymous reminded me that similar enumeration appears frequently in the Pali tradition ... for instance in the “Sabba Buddhanubhavena...” prayer. 

I am presently on the move so I am unable to access my digital library. I will provide a more thorough citation once I’m settled. In the meantime, if you see p. 94 of the prayer book found here:

https://www.sunnataram.org/uploads/498/english-chanting-book-dec2012.pdf

You will see (forgive the lack of diacritics... copy-pasted due to present conditions):

AYU-VADDHAKO DHANA-VADDHAKO SIRI-VADDHAKO YASA-VADDHAKO BALA-VADDHAKO VANNA-VADDHAKO SUKHA-VADDHAKO HOTU SABBADA.

(Again, note “dhana” instead of “dharma” just as Prof. Lubin points out in the Nevā citation).


Sincerely,

> I find no such sevenfold grouping of vr̥ddhis and/or hānis in Sanskrit sources from India.  Of course, one can find similar (though not identical) lists of good things attainable by various ritual means:

>    But I find no formulation of seven as sapta-vr̥ddhi.  For that, the only source I find is Indonesian: Tantric texts quoted in Hooykaas’s Balinese Bauddha Brahmans, p. 96, where it is deployed in the context of making “purificatory water” (pabrəsihan) for daily worship:

> Majumdar, Suvarṇadvīpa, v.2, p. 109, gives the verse in this version (with the faults of the manuscript in which it appeared):
> oṁ āyuvr̥ddhi yaśovṛddhi vr̥ddhi prajñā sukhaśriyā |

> yāvat merau sthita deva yāvad gaṅgā mahītale |
> candrarekhā gagaṇe yāvat tāvat bhuvi jayī bhaveḥ ||  (unmetrical in c)
> Majumdar calls it the mr̥tyuñjaya or dīrghāyu or saptavr̥ddhi mantra.  Your inscription is clearly alluding to this.  But I find as yet no Indian source.  (mr̥tyuñjaya-mantra is the name commonly applied in India to R̥V 7.59.12.)

> Dear colleagues,
>  
> I am working with my student Marine Schoettel to prepare an edition and translation of a major (14-plate) charter of 15th-century Java, that contains quite a number of Sanskrit stanzas, interspersed between Old Javanese prose passages. Besides the kāvya stanzas of the royal genealogy, that were certainly locally composed, there are some (possibly Indian) dharmaśāstra stanzas at the end of the text, where we read, toward the end of the charter:
>  
> yatikomaṅgu(13v4)hakna viparītaniṁ brahmamukhodita saptavr̥ddhi, ndya ta lvirannya //
>  
> XXXII. [anuṣṭubh]
>     Āyurhānir yyaśohāniḥ, hāniḥ prajñāsukhaśriyāṁ*,
>     dharmmasantā(13v5)nahāniś ca, santu te saptahānayaḥ //
>  
> We translate:
>  
> 'They will encounter what are [called] the opposites of the seven gains enunciated orally by Brahmā, as follows: "Loss of vitality, loss of glory, loss of wisdom, happiness, and fortune, loss of dharma and progeny; those shall be the seven losses!" '
>  
> I am unable to locate the saptahāni stanza in my e-text corpus. I am hoping that one of you may be able to.
>  
> Also, I am unable to find any (relevant) occurrences of the expression saptavr̥ddhi, and am curious if my impression that the Old Javanese is alluding to a text ascribed to Brahmā can somehow be confirmed from the Sanskrit tradition.
>  
> Thank you.
