Hello list members,

Would anyone happen to have a soft copy of Prof. Slaje's 1983 unpublished
dissertation, "Die Wahrnehmungslehre bei Vyomaśivaḥ", from the University
of Vienna archives? I asked Prof. Slaje first, and he doesn't have one (but
would be interested). I should also say that I do already know of one
helpful person with a hard copy who has offered to get it to me in case
there is no soft copy yet. Another colleague and I can then digitize that
if need be. There is also likely the possibility of ordering a scan from
Vienna, I suppose.

While on the subject, I realize that I never shared another such Vienna
dissertation which I myself digitized a while back. Its author, Otto
Grohma, sadly passed away just a few years after completing it. Here it is,
in case it can be of use to any of you:

Grohma 1971 Lehre vom Avayavī <https://we.tl/t-MLMNrtEiH0>  (WeTransfer
link good for a week)

Kind regards
Tyler
