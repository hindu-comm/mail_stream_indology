Dear Scholars,

I have a question about the story about the meeting of Jīva Gosvāmin and
Mīrābāī which supposedly happened when she first came to Vrindavan–it is
widely known in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava tradition, but I only heard it
transmitted viva voce and never came across any written sources for this
story. If anyone knows of a text that mentions it or is likely to mention
it, please do let me know.

आदरपूर्वकं भवदीया,
राधिका
