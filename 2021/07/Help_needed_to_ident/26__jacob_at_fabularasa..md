Dear friends,

I am trying to figure out which numeration system is being used in the 
19th-century Śrītattvanidhi attributed to Kṛṣṇarāja Oḍayar III (r. 
1799-1868) of the Kingdom of Mysore.

Dates are read from right to left, with the rightmost numeral given as a 
bhūtasaṃkhyā, and the three preceding numerals as syllables. The 
syllables largely follow the Kaṭapayādi system 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katapayadi_system), but the syllable for 
"7" varies more than the system seems to allow for, e.g.:

ghaṅachendu: gha (4) + ṅa (5) + cha (7) + indu (1) [Śaka 1754]

ṅaghaṭhendu: ṅa (5) + gha (4) + ṭha (7) + indu (1) [Śaka 1745]

ghaṅaḍendu: gha (4) + ṅa (5) + ḍa (7) + indu (1) [Śaka 1754]

Can anyone identify the system being used here?

Best regards,
Jacob
