With deep sorrow, we inform the sad demise of Prof.Venkataraja Sarma, who
was principal of Tiruvananthapuram samskrit college and worked as principal
researcher of पाणिनीयोदाहरणकोश and other works published by Ecole Francais
de extreme orient in Pondicherry.
 He was an authority on the Vykarana. He recieved Rashtrapati award and
other titles like Mahamahopadhyaya etc.
I had fortune of working with him in Pondicherry for many years though I
had nothing to do with Vyakarana.
Some of his publications can be viewed here.
