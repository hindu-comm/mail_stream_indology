Dear Friends,

Might anyone have digitized AND romanized versions of
the Vasucaritra and Manucaritra?

I'm expressly interested in

Vasucaritra (4.72), which mentions Gariḍis (the city gymnasia) and

Manucaritra (2.43), which mentions Sāmugariḍīlu (gariḍis).

Thank you.

All the best,

パトリック マッカートニー
