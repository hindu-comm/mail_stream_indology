No, it's not available as a Unicode font for Linux, to my knowledge.  But
it is available as an Adobe Type1 font (see the type1 directory at CTAN
<https://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/devanagari/velthuis/?lang=en>).  So
documents with Velthuis Devanagari compiled by TeX into DVIs can be
converted to PDF (dvitopdf) with embedded vector fonts.  But that's not
quite what you are looking for.
Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
