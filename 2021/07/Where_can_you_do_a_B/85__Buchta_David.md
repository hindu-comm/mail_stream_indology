Sorry for my delay with this, but, with caveats similar to those others
have offered, one could include:

Brown University (
https://www.brown.edu/academics/classics/academics/undergraduate-program)

Your degree would say "Classics" but the transcript would note the
Concentration track as Sanskrit (or South Asian Classics [less language
intensive], or Greek and Sanskrit, or Latin and Sanskrit).

With prerequisites, the Sanskrit track would normally require 6
semester-long Sanskrit language courses.

Best,
Dave
