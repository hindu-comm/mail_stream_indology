Hello Dr Anderson,

This is not exactly in my focus area so I'm sure others will have better
suggestions, but two texts immediately come to mind:

Geslani, M. (2018). Rites of the God-King: Santi and Ritual Change in Early
Hinduism. United States: Oxford University Press.

Gonda, Jan. Ancient Indian Kingship from the Religious Point of
View. Germany, E. J. Brill, 1966.

I also feel like there might be something in PV Kane's encyclopedic works,
but I'm not sure.

sincerely,
Tejas
