Hi Dean,

In *Kalikapurana* is accounted a detailed biography of Naraka that is
considered the one who founded the Kamaupa (Hindu[ized]) kingdom.

Guwahati edition of KP, see ch. 36-40
Shastri, B., ed. and trans. (2008) * The Kalikapurana: Sanskrit Text with
English Translation*. Delhi: Nag Publishers. First published 1991, in three
volume.

Vankatesvar press ed. (=Bombay ed) ed., should be ch. 37-41

Kulke worked a lot on the foundation of Hindu kingdoms in Eastern India
considering the dialectic between the local population and Hindu high
castes. You can find useful insights in these publications:

Kulke, Hermann. 1986. "Royal Temple Policy and the Structure of Medieval
Hindu Kingdoms". In *The Cult of Jagannath and the Regional Tradition of
Orissa*. Edited by Anncharlotte Eschmann, Hermann Kulke and Gaya C.
Tripathi. Delhi: Manhoar, pp. 125–37. First published 1978.

Kulke, Hermann. 1976. "Kshatriyaization and Social Change. A Study in
Orissa Setting". In A*spects of Changing India: Studies in Honour of
Professor G.S. Ghurye*. Edited by S. Devadasa Pillai. Mumbai: Popular
Prakashan, pp. 398–409.

Kulke, Hermann. 1992. "Tribal Deities at Princely Courts: The Feudatory
Rajas of Central Orissa and Their Tutelary Deities". In *Realm of the
Sacred: Verbal Symbolism and Ritual Structures*. Edited by Sitakant
Mahapatra. Calcutta: Oxford University Press, pp. 56–78.

Eschmann, Anncharlott. 1986. "Hinduization of Tribal Deities in Orissa: The
Sakta and Saiva Typoloy". In *The Cult of Jagannath and the Regional
Tradition of Orissa.* Edited by Anncharlotte Eschmann, Hermann Kulke and
Gaya C. Tripathi. Delhi: Manhoar, pp. 125–37. First published 1978.

Although it focuses on Assam history, maybe it could be of interest the
article of Shin:

Shin, Jae-Eun. 2010. “Yoni, Yoginīs and Mahāvidyās: Feminine Divinities
from Early Medieval Kāmarūpa to Medieval Koch Behar.” *Studies in History*
26 (1): 1–29.


I hope it can be of help.

Best,
Paolo
