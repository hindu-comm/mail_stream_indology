Dear list,

I am working on a short grammatical text in Pali called the Kaccāyanasāra,
composed in Burma, probably around the 14th century. It is a Pali version
of Caṅgadāsa's Sambandhopadeśa. Not all verses, however, derive from Caṅga.
Some seem to be borrowed from a certain *sakkatagantha* "Sanskrit book",
cited in the *navaṭīkā* on the Kaccāyanasāra. One of the stanzas borrowed
from the Sanskrit book is the following:

anādir ayam āloko saddakhyo yassa na pphuṭo ||
> byañjate tassa satthena dīpo va gatiy' āvuto || 43 ||


The idea is quite common but I have been unable to find the exact Sanskrit
source for this text and I would be most grateful if anyone could offer
help. Maybe it is simply a recast from other famous stanzas with similar
meaning.

Many thanks and best wishes,
Aleix
