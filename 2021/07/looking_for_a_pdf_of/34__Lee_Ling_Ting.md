Dear All,

I'm looking for a PDF of P.K. Mukhopadhay's The Nyāya theory of linguistic
performance: A new interpretation of Tattvacintāmaṇi (Publisher: Published
for Jadavpur University, Calcutta by K.P. Bagchi & Co, 1992).

Kindly let me know if you know where I could get a copy of it.

Thank you!

Sincerely,
Lee Ling
