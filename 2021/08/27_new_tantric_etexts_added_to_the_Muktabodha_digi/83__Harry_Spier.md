 Dear list members,

I am pleased to announce on behalf of the Muktabodha Indological Research
Institute:

* 1) 27 new etexts have been added to the searchable e-text library of
Muktabodha.*
(See details in this email below with brief descriptions of the contents by
Mark S.G. Dyczkowski).

* 2) New features have been added to the searchable e-text library*
a) All texts are now viewable and downloadable as text files in unicode
devanagari.
b) Because the library has a large number of paddhatis, a  new subject
category of "paddhati" has been added to aid users in locating these when
they list the texts by subject category.

The digital library can be reached from either the Muktabodha website
www.muktabodha.org or directly from:
https://muktalib7.com/DL_CATALOG_ROOT/digital_library_secure_entry.htm
