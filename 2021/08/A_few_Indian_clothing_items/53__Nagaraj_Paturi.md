>> Dear list members,
>>
>> I have a few questions about (ancient/medieval) Indian clothing items.
>>
>> My starting point is Amaruśataka 100:
>>
>> kānte talpam upāgate vigalitā nīvī svayaṃ bandhanād
>>
>> vāso viślathamekhalāguṇadhṛtaṃ kiṃcinnitambe sthitam |
>>
>> etāvat sakhi vedmi sampratam ahaṃ tasyāṅgasaṅge punaḥ
>>
>> ko 'yaṃ kāsmi rataṃ nu vā katham iti svalpāpi me na smṛtiḥ ||
>>
>> Once the nāyikā's nīvī falls off by itself, her dress (vāsas) hangs a
>> little bit from the “threads” of her mekhalā. So there are (at least) three
>> layers, which, from the innermost to the outermost, are: 1) mekhalā 2)
>> dress 3) nīvī.
>>
>> A mekhalā should be a belt made of metal, so I guess it has some wires or
>> thin chains (the guṇas of the stanza) that hang and that might be decorated
>> with pearls and the like. This explains how it is that in the stanza the
>> dress is said to hang from the mekhalā: it gets caught on the wires/chains
>> and the decorative items.
>>
>> But the nīvī is the item I am especially curious about. It is defined in
>> Amarakoṣa 3.3.213 (I follow Oka's 1913 edition with Kṣīrasvāmin's
>> commentary, p. 217) in this way: strīkaṭīvastrabandhe 'pi nīvī [paripaṇe
>> 'pi ca]. An Amaruśataka commentator called Caturbhuja glosses nīvī as
>> vastragranthiḥ. A different commentator, Sūryadāsa, explains the sentence
>> nīvī svayaṃ bandhanād vigalitā with the words nitambasicaye bandhanāt
>> saṃniveśād granthiḥ visrastaḥ. It seems to me that a nīvī should be both a
>> sash that steadies the clothes on the hips and the knot of the sash.
>>
>> Now, my questions/requests are:
>>
>> 0) Please, kindly let me know if I am on the wrong track with regard to
>> the mekhalā and the nīvī.
>>
>> 1) In one manuscript of Sūryadāsa's commentary the word nīvī is followed
>> by the word dhudhurikā, which might well be a gloss. The scribe was active
>> in Bundi (Rajasthan), is dhudhurikā a Rajasthani word?
>>
>> 2) Can anyone show me a painting or other kind of image of a lady wearing
>> a nīvī?
>>
>> 3) Does anyone know roughly when and where the kind of clothing I
>> described above was in use?
>>
>> 4) As far as I know, in present-day India nivi is the name of one of the
>> sari binding styles. Is this word related to the Sanskrit word nīvī?
>>
>> Sorry for the long brainstorming and the many questions.
>>
>> All the best,
