Dear All,

I was wondering if there are any texts that list the names of known works
that are composed in specific meters? I am currently working on the Yavana
Jātaka which is composed in Indra Vajra verses, but am struggling to find
the other sorts of works that were composed in the same meter. Kāvya is a
new genre to me, so any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Tejas Aralere
