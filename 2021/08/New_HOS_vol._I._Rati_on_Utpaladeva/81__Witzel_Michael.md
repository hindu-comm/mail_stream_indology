It is with great pleasure that we can announce a new volume of the Harvard Oriental Series, vol.96:

Isabelle Ratié,
Utpaladeva on the Power of Action: A First Edition, Annotated Translation, and Study of Īśvarapratyabhijñāvivṛti, Chapter 2.1<https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674270817>

HUP Summary: Utpaladeva on the Power of Action provides the first critical edition, annotated translation, and study of the first three chapters of the Recognition of the Lord, a landmark in the history of nondual Śaivism by Utpaladeva, that were recently recovered from marginal annotations in manuscripts of other commentaries on Utpaladeva’s treatise.

(More HOS books are being printed/in the pipeline).
M. Witzel
