Hello Hans,

     I have lost track of some of the relevant old publications, but I
remember that some of the occurrences of ṣ in Sanskrit were accounted for
by Fortunatov's law regarding the IE l+dental changing to retroflex in
Sanskrit, and some others may be what Thomas Burrow called spontaneous
retroflexes. Are some of your examples [other than *ruki *and *oḱtō >
aštā *‘eight’,
covered by these theories?
     The other indication to suggest the instability of ṇ/ṣ is the
discussion in the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka about whether the RV Saṃhitā was
aṣakāra/aṇakāra or saṣakāra/saṇakāra. The Āraṇyaka says that the Māṇḍūkeya
version of the RV was saṣakāra/saṇakāra, and that Śākalya followed
Māṇḍūkeya in this respect. But the discussion itself indicates that there
may have been other reciters whose Saṃhitā was aṣakāra/aṇakāra.
