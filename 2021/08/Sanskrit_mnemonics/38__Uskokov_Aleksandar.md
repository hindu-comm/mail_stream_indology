Dear Antonia.

There is this verse in the Mukunda-mAlA (verse 33 in some editions) --

kṛṣṇo rakṣatu no jagat-traya-guruḥ kṛṣṇaṃ namasyāmy ahaṃ
kṛṣṇenāmara-śatravo vinihatāḥ kṛṣṇāya tasmai namaḥ |
kṛṣṇād eva samutthitaṃ jagad idaṃ kṛṣṇasya dāso 'smy ahaṃ
kṛṣṇe tiṣṭhati sarvam etad akhilaṃ he kṛṣṇa saṃrakṣa mām ||

Best wishes,
Aleksandar

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Sanskrit mnemonics?

Dear all,

Whenever I've learnt a language in a classroom setting, we'd get mnemonics to help us remember word forms or uses. (I am thinking of things like 'after si, nisi, num, ne, all the ali's fly away', or 'If one shwa by another is hounded, the first is silent, the second sounded.')

Do any of you have any such mnemonics (no matter how silly - or dare I say: the sillier, the better?) for Sanskrit? So far I only have minuscule things like reminding students of Har*e* Kṛṣṇa (for the vocative of i-stems), and also verses like

gurureva gatirgurumeva bhaje guruṇaiva sahāsmi namo gurave |
na guroḥ paramaṃ śiśurasmi gurormatirastu gurau mama pāhi guro ||

If you have anything you use that works well with your students, I'd be grateful if you were willing to share it. I'll happily sum up everything I get in an email to the List.

Many thanks, as always,
    Antonia
