Dear Palaniappan,



Apart from the Harivaṃśa, the Southern recension of the Mahābhārata and many
purāṇas relate the story of Bāṇāsura. The Mahābhārata
(2.35.29.d*21.1448–1534), the Bhāgavata– (10.62.1–63.53), the Brahma–
(205.9–206.50), and the Viṣṇu–purāṇa (5.32.6–33.50) share more or less the
similar storyline with the Harivaṃśa, while the version of the Kūrma–purāṇa
(1.17.1–7) differs a bit more from the others. Bāṇa also appears in the
Kālikā–purāṇa, in the story of Naraka. In this purāṇa, it is he, who taught
the worship of Śiva to Naraka (Kālikā–purāṇa 39.1–8).

In connection with Bāṇa’s dance, I offer to read Phyllis Granoff’s article,
entitled Mahākāla’s Journey: From Gaṇa to God.
