Dear Friends,

I’m pleased to announce the addition of the Dānakāṇḍa of the Kṛtyakalpataru<https://sites.utexas.edu/sanskrit/danakanda-krtyakalpataru/> by Lakṣmīdhara to the Resource Library for Dharmaśāstra Studies<https://sites.utexas.edu/sanskrit/resources/dharmasastra/>. The transcription was completed by David Brick and is based on his critical edition published in the Harvard Oriental Series.

Best, Don
