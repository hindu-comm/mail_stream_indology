A word in many modern Indian languages that comes phonetically close to
this is Ghungroo, the dancer's bells. I don't know if this will fit the
context of your text.  The other word is Ghāgar referring to a water pot.
Such words could possibly be Sanskritized as ghargharikā. Again the context
may or may not support any of these suggestions.
