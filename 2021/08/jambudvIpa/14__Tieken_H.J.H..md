Dear list members,

in a contribution by Gokul Sashadri in Kulke et al, Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa. Delhi: Manohar, p. 107, I came across a reference to Jambudvīpa in a late (seventeenth century) Pāli text, namely the Gandhavaṃsa, in which Jambudvīpa would be used to refer to peninsular India. I am interested to know if this interpretation is correct for the Gandhavaṃsa and if we have to do with an old (how old?) use of the word.

With kind regards, Herman
