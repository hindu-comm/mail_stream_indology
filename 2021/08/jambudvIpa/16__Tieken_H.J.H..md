Dear List members,

from the reactions of Victor Davella and Patrick Olivelle (both off list) it is clear that the use of Jambūdvīpa as referring to peninsular India is most probably late.

The information provided by Rajam put me on the trail of a South Indian goddess Campāpati. She is mentioned in Maṇimēkalai 6. 190 and in the Patikam to this text, line 8. Especially the Patikam passage is interesting. It mentions a goddess who, after she has practiced austerities under a campu (Jambū) tree (campu kīḻ), went to the South (teṉ ticai), where she became known as Campāpati. At the same time, I wonder if there is a direct link between campā and campu.

Dear Professor Tieken,

It would help if we look at the usage of the following words in Old Tamil [I don’t know exactly how old they are] texts:

சம்பு, சம்பாபதி, சம்புத்தீவு, நாவல், நாவலந்தீவு …

Thanks and Regards,
rajam

Dear list members,
in a contribution by Gokul Sashadri in Kulke et al, Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa. Delhi: Manohar, p. 107, I came across a reference to Jambudvīpa in a late (seventeenth century) Pāli text, namely the Gandhavaṃsa, in which Jambudvīpa would be used to refer to peninsular India. I am interested to know if this interpretation is correct for the Gandhavaṃsa and if we have to do with an old (how old?) use of the word.
With kind regards, Herman
