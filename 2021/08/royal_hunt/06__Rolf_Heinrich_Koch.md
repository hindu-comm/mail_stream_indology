Dear listmembers,

I am searching for quotations (preferably in Sanskrit/Pali sources) 
which clearly describe that for a royal hunting trip the animal to be 
hunted has been caught beforehand and later released for this royal hunt.

This would be helpful for the interpretation of a picture strip which 
visualizes the Ä€lavaka-damana-story according to thr Buddhist commentary 
literature.

Has any of you stumbled upon such a passage by chance?


Many thanks

Heiner
