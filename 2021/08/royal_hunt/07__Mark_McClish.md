Dear Heiner,

As much can be implied in the Arthaśāstra at 2.2.3, which provides rules for establishing the king’s mṛgavana. It is to be provisioned, among other things, with bhagnanakhadaṃṣṭravyāla: various kinds of vicious animals with their claws and fangs broken or removed. Here is the passage from the Kyōto e-text:

tāvanmātram ekadvāraṃ khātaguptaṃ svāduphalagulmaguccham akaṇṭakidrumam uttānatoyāśayaṃ dāntamṛgacatuṣpadaṃ bhagnanakhadaṃṣṭravyālaṃ mārgayukahastihastinīkalabhaṃ mṛgavanaṃ vihārārthaṃ rājñaḥ kārayet | sarvātithimṛgaṃ pratyante cānyanmṛgavanaṃ bhūmivaśena vā niveśayet |

Best,
Mark

Dear listmembers,

I am searching for quotations (preferably in Sanskrit/Pali sources) which clearly describe that for a royal hunting trip the animal to be hunted has been caught beforehand and later released for this royal hunt.

This would be helpful for the interpretation of a picture strip which visualizes the Ālavaka-damana-story according to thr Buddhist commentary literature.

Has any of you stumbled upon such a passage by chance?


Many thanks

Heiner
