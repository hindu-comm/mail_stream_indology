Dear colleagues,

I am curious if any work has been done on the attribution of the
Govindāṣṭaka to Śaṅkara. Gussner's 1976 JAOS article ("A Stylometric
Study...") rejects the attribution to Śaṅkara of most of the stotras
considered therein, but the Govindāṣṭaka is not included in the study.
Amarnath Ray, in 1935 in BSOAS, states that Jīva Gosvāmin had made this
attribution, but does not cite a source, and my cursory attempt to find
this in some of Jīva's main works has proven futile. Any suggestions are
welcome.

Thanks,
Dave
