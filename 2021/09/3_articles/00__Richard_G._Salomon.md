Hi Stefan,

I have not been able to locate copies of these three articles from the
Gandhari bibliography. Do you perchance have copies of them? >>

B. N. Mukherjee 1990. “Kharoshṭī inscriptions from Chunar (U.P.).” *Monthly
Bulletin of the Asiatic Society* 19: 1–9.
B. N. Mukherjee 1990. “A Kharoṣṭhī‐Brāhmī seal‐matrix from Oc-Eo.” *Monthly
Bulletin of the Asiatic Society* 19: 1–4.
B. N. Mukherjee 1990. “A sealing in the Lopburi Museum (Thailand).” *Monthly
Bulletin of the Asiatic Society* 19: 1–2. \

Thanks. Hoping all is well there --

Rich
