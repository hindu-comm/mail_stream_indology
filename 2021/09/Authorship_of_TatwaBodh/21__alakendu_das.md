Respected scholars,
Presently I am going through a book entitled "TatwaBodh,", which happens to be a unique treatise on Vedanta philosophy from the the point of views of Absolute Monism.The book is an English translation of the Sanskrit original.However, it's not clearly mentioned as to who wrote the original version in Sanskrit.Can the authorship of "TatwaBodh" attributed to Shankaracharya? I would be benefitted ,if anyone can enlighten me with the author's name of "TatwaBodh".Regards.Alakendu Das.
