Dear colleagues,

The South Asian Network Ghent Research group at Ghent University  (https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/sangh) invites applications for a postdoctoral fellowship from scholars wishing to join our department. Our research group currently also hosts expertise in South Asian Buddhism, art and archeology (contact: Daniela De Simone, daniela.desimone at ugent.be), and Jain studies, South Asian language and literature (Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhramsha, Hindi), philosophy, and history (contact: Eva De Clercq, ev.declercq at ugent.be).

Interested scholars are invited to send us their CV and a short abstract describing their project.

The candidates will apply for a fellowship (junior or senior) through the Fund for Scientific Research â€“ Flanders (www.fwo.be<http://www.fwo.be>), with a deadline of December 1st.

Please feel free to forward this information to any interested parties.

Best regards,

Eva
