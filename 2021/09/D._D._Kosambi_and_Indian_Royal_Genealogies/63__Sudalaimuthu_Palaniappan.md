Dear Indologists,



I remember posting in Indology several years ago a quote by D. D. Kosambi about invented royal genealogies. Unfortunately, I have lost the reference. Indology archives is not searchable. Does anyone remember the quote and reference? 



Thank you very much.



Regards,

Palaniappan
