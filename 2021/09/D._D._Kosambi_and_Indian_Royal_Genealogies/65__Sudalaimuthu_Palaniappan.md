Dear Don,



Thank you. 



The Henige article addresses the problems in historiography using epigraphy. The quote I had in mind commented on the Brahmin’s efforts to create royal genealogies based on solar and lunar lineages. In any case, I found the article you sent to be useful for other reasons.



Thanks again



Regards,

Palaniappan

Dear Palaniappan,



I don’t recall the Kosambi quote, but the following work by David Henige may also be useful for your question. I’ll send it to you separately.



David P. Henige. “Some Phantom Dynasties of Early and Medieval India: Epigraphic Evidence and the Abhorrence of a Vacuum.” Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol.38, No. 3 (1975), pp. 525-549.



Best, Don

Dear Indologists,



I remember posting in Indology several years ago a quote by D. D. Kosambi about invented royal genealogies. Unfortunately, I have lost the reference. Indology archives is not searchable. Does anyone remember the quote and reference? 



Thank you very much.



Regards,

Palaniappan
