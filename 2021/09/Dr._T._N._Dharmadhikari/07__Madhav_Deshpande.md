Dear Colleagues,

     Harry Spier brought to my attention the news that Dr. T.N.
Dharmadhikari passed away this morning. I spoke to my sister in Pune and
she confirmed this news.
     Dharmadhikari along with V.V. Bhide and S.D. Joshi was a college
classmate of my father and so I have known them all as my uncles [kaka]
since my childhood. My father used to call him Dharmaraj, and for a long
time I thought that this was his name.
     Along with my father, Dharmadhikari came to see me off at the Cochin
harbor as I was boarding my ship to go to New York in 1968.
     Dharmadhikari directed the Vaidika Samshodhan Mandal of Pune, and
edited many Vedic texts including the Taittirīya Saṃhitā and the Maitrāyaṇī
Saṃhitā and he was among the few modern Indian scholars doing such critical
work with Vedic texts. He did his Ph.D. degree under the guidance of the
late Professor M. A. Mehendale.
     Later, while I was working on the text of Vedavicāra, I used to see
him once a week to read this text and with his help a number of knotty
readings and passages received a good interpretation.
     For the last several years, Dharmadhikari was not in good health, and
his wife passed away a few years ago. With the passing of Dharmadhikari,
almost an entire generation of eminent Sanskrit scholars of Pune has gone
into history.
