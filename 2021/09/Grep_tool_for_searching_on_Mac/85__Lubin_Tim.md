BBEdit is most common for grepping on Mac, but some other editors do it, e.g., Oxygen xml editor.
Before I switched to Mac, I used Examine64 for grep searches:
https://www.examine64.com/
As I recall, it could even search binary files (e.g., docx, rtf, pdf), which BBEdit cannot do.

Best,
Tim Lubin

On a Mac, BBEdit does "grep" multifile search.

Best wishes,

Most good text editors have both a "find in files" feature that allows you to search in multiple files or whole directories at a time and also have a "regular expressions" feature that allow you to do what you call "grep" searchs.  I use notepad++ on windows but I can't give you the name of a text editor for Mac as I'm not a Mac user.  The Muktabodha digital library searchable etext library has that feature built in, but only for use on its searchable etext collection.

Dear all

Thanks
