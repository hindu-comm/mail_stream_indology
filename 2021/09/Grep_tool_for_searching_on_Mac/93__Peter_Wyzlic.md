You already have it. 

The program is in the Unix part of the system. Go to Spotlight Finder (generally opened by Command + Space), then type in "Terminal“ and take the offered program icon or hit the Launchpad icon and type in "Terminal“. Grep is one of the base Unix commands that is invoked in the text terminal. 

Base syntax: grep "search pattern“ filename (like this: link: <https://i.postimg.cc/zBry4r9t/screenshot-01.png>):

The program gives out lines that match the search pattern as simple text. Like this : <https://i.postimg.cc/Fs7HWzYF/screenshot-02.png>

To get the command line options, type in "man grep“ and hit enter.

Text editors like BBedit give this a more amiable user interface, of course.

All the best
