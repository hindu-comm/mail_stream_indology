Madhav, here's a pleasant, short account
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep#History> of the history of how Ken
Thompson, now 78, wrote grep.  Here's a nice 2019 interview of Thompson
himself talking about grep
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY6q5dv_B-o&t=2120s>.  It's lovely that
grep gets a round of applause :-)
For the slightly braver, there are now command-line tools like ack and ag
<https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher> (and sack and sag
<https://github.com/sampson-chen/sack>) that are recursive and blindingly
fast.  But grep is still wonderful and probably enough for most purposes.

Best,
Dominik
