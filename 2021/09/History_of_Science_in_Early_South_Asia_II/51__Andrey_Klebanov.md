Dear members of the list,

I am pleased to announce that the second round of online workshops organised by the working group “History of Science in Early South Asia” under the aegis of theConsortium for History of Science, Technology and Medicinewill commence soon,on September 20th.

During this academic year, our working group will broaden the scope of discussed subjects to include the study of premodern astral sciences and mathematics as well as other topics related to the history of South Asian scientific systems and literature.

The working group will host sessions in different formats: traditional paper presentations, discussions of pre-circulated papers, status reports, and joint reading sessions.

Please referhere(https://www.chstm.org/early-south-asia) for the current schedule. Note that all times are indicated in EST. You will need to register as a member of the group (this is an entirely informal process) to access the Zoom link and the uploaded reading materials. Once logged in, you will also see the meeting times according to your time zone.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to your students and whoever may be interested! We hope that many of you can join some of our sessions and participate in the discussion.

best,
Andrey
