Dear Hans,



In normal day-to-day interaction, to convey the meaning intended by the English sentences, the sentence 3 in (a) should have the verb ‘ceytuviṭṭu’ to denote the completion of the ‘doing’ action. Sentence 3 in (b) should have the word for ‘after’ as in ‘ceyta piṉ’. Otherwise, it might give the meaning that ‘we’ worshipped them and took them to the shop. Sentence 3 in (c) would give the meaning that we will take them to the shop to worship too (may be, some priests are being invited to the inauguration of a shop, where the priests have to offer worship in addition to buying stuff!)



Hope this helps.



Regards,

Palaniappan

Subject: [INDOLOGY] Question about Tamil grammar and usage



Dear Tamil-specialists, 



I would appreciate your enlightening me on the following issue



Tamil is reported to have discourse-linkage structures such as the one in (a) below, in which the final verb of an earlier sentence is resumed in the form of a converb (or conjunctive participle) at the beginning of the next sentence. In such structures the [+ human] subjects of the converb and the main verb of the sentence have to be identical.

I understand that, as a consequence, structures like the third line of (b) are unacceptable, because the subject of cey-tu and celvōm are human and not identical. Would the use of the infinitive ceyy-a ± ‑um as in (c) improve the sentence or even make it grammatical? 

Hoping that some of you will be able to answer my question,



I remain with best wishes to all,



Hans Henrich Hock
