Dear Professor Tieken,

I see at least two sides to your query:

1. The ‘word' ‘kaṭṭuvicci’  for soothsayer in Tamil literature.

2. The (soothsaying) 'character’ in caṅkam (Sangam) poetry.

++++++++++

Regarding #1 above … 

You are correct. The word ‘kaṭṭuvicci’ for a soothsayer in Tamil literature does not appear until in the Vaishnava texts. 
However the concept of soothsaying is expressed in earlier texts such as the Tolkappiyam, where the soothsaying is referred to as ‘kaṭṭu.’
I think it is also mentioned in the Cilappathikaram or Manimekalai, I forget. 


Regarding #2 above … 

///Apparently, the character is absent in Caṅkam poetry./// 

The soothsaying character is very much present in caṅkam poetry. She is referred to as ‘akavaṉ makaḷ.’  Please see kuruntokai 23.

For a very good Index in Tamil, if you haven’t already, you can browse and rely on Dr. Pandiyaraja’s Sangam Concordance: http://tamilconcordance.in/concordance_list-B.html <http://tamilconcordance.in/concordance_list-B.html> 


Best regards,
rajam

If not, is there someone who happens to know other, more occurrences of the word in Vaiṣṇava poetry or knows of a publication about the kaṭṭuvicci?
