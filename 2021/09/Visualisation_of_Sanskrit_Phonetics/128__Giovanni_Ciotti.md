Dear Dr Ryan,

This seems to have been a matter of debate within the tradition since quite
some time; cf. Uvaṭa at *Ṛgvedaprātiśākhya* 1.1:

śikṣādibhir yat sāmānyenotsargeṇoktaṃ lakṣaṇam | yathā tāvac chikṣāyām syur
mūrdhanyā ‘ṛṭuraṣāḥ’ sāmānyena sarvaśākhāsu repho mūrdhanya ity uktaḥ |
tathānyasyāṃ śikṣāyām ‘dantamūlīyaḥ’ iti repho dantamūlīya uktaḥ | evaṃ
sarvā śikṣā varṇeṣu sthānakaraṇānupradānādi sarvāsu śākhāsu vidadhāti | na
tu niyamataḥ kasyāṃ śākhāyāṃ repho mūrdhanyaḥ kasyāṃ dantamūlīya iti | ata
etad vyavasthāpakam ārabhyate ‘dantamūlīyas tu takāravargaḥ’
‘sakārarephalakārāś ca’ ‘rephaṃ vartsyam eke’ | evam asyāṃ śākhāyāṃ
dantamūlīyo vā vartsyo vā repha ity etad avadhāritam |

In any case, one should always keep in mind that phonetics and phonology
don't really have a one-to-one correspondence.

All best,
Giovanni
