Dear Jim and others,

I apologize for sending out such technical passages without further
annotation or clarification. Please find a translation of the Prakāśa
passage here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XElrRPzJbP4PnnLdZqXFu4fWh0GcNd8_b5pojWwPz2o/edit?usp=sharing

I'm afraid I dashed this off in a bit of a rush so there might be (very
probably are) errors. According to Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇini is a yuvan form, i.e., a
great grandson of Paṇin with at least one surviving male ancestor in the
immediate line of descent going back to Paṇin. Paṇin is a name
meaning possessing paṇa, which is equivalent to stuti as Gary rightly
pointed out. Kṛṣṇa rejects the possibility that paṇa could be
something like measurement (parimāṇa) on the basis of  P. 3.3.66, by which
we also form mūlakapaṇa "fist full of radishes", but notes that others do
accept it. I think the fist full of radishes for trade is sort of a
humorous way to allude to and reject the other meaning of paṇ, vyavahāra.
The final bit where he refutes Viṭṭhala requires more annotation.

All the Best,
Victor
