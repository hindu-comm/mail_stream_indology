Dear Madhav,
You are no doubt right that there are probably no traces in the works
of  grammarians from Kātyāyana to Nāgeśa of any active dislike of Pāṇini’s
trader community background (i.e., 'Vedic' trader community, as I
explained),
but it remains remarkable that his students etc. went so far as to indicate
his lineage not so much by referring to his father or forefather but rather
by referring to his mother, Dākṣī, the ‘lady of the (north-west Indian)
Dakṣa-clan’ (cf. currently Ghora Dakka in north Pakistan, the "British
regiment" story about this place name could perhaps explain Ghora but not
Dakka; the Dakṣas were politically organized in a 'republic' rather than a
kingdom, cf. the dākṣaḥ saṁghaḥ Kāśikā on 4.3.127).
Other grammarians of his and preceding and successive generations do have
names more evidently (known as) Brahminical: Śākaṭāyana, Śākalya, Gārgya,
Bhāradvāja, Kāśyapa, Kātyāyana...
Incidentally, the first European to have sufficient affinity with Pāṇini to
be able to decipher his grammar had also a solid background in a trader
community: Otto Böhtlingk, whose forefathers adopted the Dutch nationality
in order to be able to settle as merchants in the Russian Empire.
The convergence-assimilation -- implying in some respects perhaps also, as
Gary suggests, a coverup -- of √paṇ (with distinctive, semantically
relevant cerebral ṇ) ‘barter, trade; gamble’ with another root known in the
Veda, √pan ‘praise’, must be a later (post-Vedic) development as reflected
in the peculiar formulation of DhP 466-467: DhP 466 páṇA vyavahāre stutau
ca | 467 pánA ca, with the latter amounting to pánA stutau (listed as such
by S.M. Katre). Other nouns derived or derivable from √paṇ such as paṇya
are predominantly in the domain of trade and commerce. The semantic and
formal separation of the two roots by Whitney is therefore entirely
justified: √pan 'admire', [RV,B] and √paṇ 'bargain' [AV,B,E; some forms,
such as paṇ-í '(non-Vedic) trader community', already in RV].
Best,
Jan
