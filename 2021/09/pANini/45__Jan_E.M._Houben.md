Dear Roland,
What remains is that Böhtlingk's family belonged to the Dutch merchant
community in St. Petersburg.
Whether or not his forefathers had adopted the Dutch nationality which at
that time was practically the only way to be officially allowed to settle
in the Russian empire depends on the archival evidence that can be found,
*minus* coverup attempts that may have followed... There were very old
Lutheran congregations in the Dutch republic preaching since the 16th
century in 'Nederduits' -- grammatically standardized several centuries
before 'Hochdeutsch' -- so the religious or even religious-linguistic
affiliation need not be a decisive factor.
N.B. the existence of a German Lutheran congregation in St. Petersburg in
the early and mid-19th century should not be construed according to the
political situation of middle Europe in the late 19th century,
post-Bismarck.
Best,
Jan Houben
