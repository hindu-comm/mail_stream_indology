Dear Friends,

I’m pleased to announce the addition of the Vyavahārakāṇḍa of the Kṛtyakalpataru<https://sites.utexas.edu/sanskrit/resources/dharmasastra/krtyakalpataru/> by Lakṣmīdhara to the Resource Library for Dharmaśāstra Studies<https://sites.utexas.edu/sanskrit/resources/dharmasastra/>. The transcription was completed by Patrick Olivelle and is based on the edition of K.V. Rangaswami Aiyangar published in Gaekwad’s Oriental Series.

Best, Don
