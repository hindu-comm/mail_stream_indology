Dear List members,

For those interested, on my website I have under the heading "Publications> Articles" posted a short article titled: "A Songster's Hairdo, a Waistcloth, and a Pregnant Lizard", in which an attempt is made try to find out what these three "things", which in Old Tamil Caá¹…kam literature are linked together in comparisons, have in common with each other.

With kind regards, Herman
