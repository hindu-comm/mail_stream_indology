Dear Harry,

thank you for your kind of reply off-list! The contents of Ṛgveda Khilas 
are not all the same age – Prof. Witzel himself remarks in his footnote 
(118) to the quote you gave: “The hymns are of various age, and 
many have various additions, e.g., the Śrīsūkta has Brāhmaṇa 
time and even later, unaccented additions.”

I have not studied the Śrīsūkta in detail, but I'm confident that the 
age of the modified Gāyatrī mantra it contains does not depend on its 
source (i.e. it's probably a later addition). In this particular case, 
it is important to bear in mind that the worship of Mahālakṣmī and Viṣṇu 
only developed more than a millennium after the composition of the 
Ṛgvedic hymns. Cf. Marion Rastelli, “Mahālakṣmī. Integrating a Goddess 
into the Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā.” /IIJ/ 58 (2015): 325–356, doi: 
10.1163/15728536-05804002.

For a critical assessment of Scheftelowitz's arguments, see Theodore N. 
Proferes, “The Relative Chronology of the /nivid/s and /praiṣa/s and the 
Standardisation of Vedic Ritual.” /IIJ/ 57 (2014): 199–221, doi: 
10.1163/15728536-05703013.

Best,

D. Haas
