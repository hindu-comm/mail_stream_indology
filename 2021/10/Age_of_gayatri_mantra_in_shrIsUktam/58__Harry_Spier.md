Dear Dominik,
Thank you for clearing this up.  Somehow I missed Michael's footnote.
Does anyone have a pdf of those two articles  referred to:
 Theodore N. Proferes, “The Relative Chronology of the *nivid*s and *praiṣa*s
and the Standardisation of Vedic Ritual.” *IIJ* 57 (2014): 199–221, doi:
10.1163/15728536-05703013.
Marion Rastelli, “Mahālakṣmī. Integrating a Goddess into the
Ahirbudhnyasaṃhitā.” *IIJ* 58 (2015): 325–356, doi:
10.1163/15728536-05804002.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
