*Topic*: Mesopotamian and Indian Bird Omens

*Abstract*
This presentation explores the relationship between bird omens that occur
in both the Sanskrit *Gārgīyajyotiṣa* Aṅga 42 and the Akkadian *Šumma Ālu* and
related Cuneiform tablets. After an overview of the Sanskrit omens and
their source, the study proceeds to compare the Indian and Mesopotamian
bird omens with special reference to the omens of the crow in an attempt to
show that the Akkadian omens was the archetype of the Sanskrit omen verses.
The paper concludes with a list of contents of Aṅga 42, followed by the
Sanskrit text and translation of verses 6-29 on the crow.
