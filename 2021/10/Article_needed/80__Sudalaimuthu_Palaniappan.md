Dear Indologists,



I am looking for a PDF of the following article. 



Burton Stein (1978). "All the King's Mana: Perspectives on Kinship in Medieval South India." in Kingship and Authority in South Asia. J. F. Richards, ed. pp. 115-167.



The local university library does not have the volume.



Thank you in advance.



Regards,

Palaniappan
