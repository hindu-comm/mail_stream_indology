Dear list members,

The word nīrāñjana or nīrāṁjana appears  in a few of the tantric texts of
Muktabodha. But I can't find it in any of the dictionaries.  Is this just
another spelling for nirañjana meaning the pure one, or another spelling of
nīrājana meaning "the waving of lights" or does it have another meaning.
Thanks,
Harry Spier
