Dear list members,
1) If there are any list members who have worked   with the H Daniel Smith
Agama collection, either the originals in the Cleveland library or the
photocopies made by Claude Setzer in the University of Iowa library could
you please contact me. Or if members know which scholars have worked with
the collection that information would also be appreciated.

2) Does anyone have contact information for Claude Setzer who photocopied a
selection of the original colleciton.

Thanks,
Harry Spier
