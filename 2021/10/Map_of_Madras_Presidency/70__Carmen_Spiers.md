Dear Sir,
the French Institute of Pondicherry (https://www.ifpindia.org) has an
extensive map collection as well as a department dedicated to map-making
and other technological renderings of data. You can contact the head of
this department Julien Andrieu for potential collaboration and pointers:
julien.andrieu at ifpindia.org
The map collection is perhaps under the Library department, for which you
can contact the head Anurupa Naik: anurupa.n at ifpindia.org
I hope this helps.
Best, Carmen (IFP Indology)
