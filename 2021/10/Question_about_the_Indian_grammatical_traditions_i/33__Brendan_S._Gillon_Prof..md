Dear colleagues and friends,

I have an undergraduate student interested in getting a better 
understanding on the impact of the Indian grammatical tradition on 19th 
century philology and early 20th century linguistics. I would be 
grateful to receive some suggestions of books and article he, and I for 
that matter, might read.

Best wishes,

Brendan
