Dear friends,

After plunging recently (and perhaps foolishly) into Tibetan materials on the Svarodayatantra, I was surprised to find that the histories of the transmission lineage mention Abhinavagupta. I believe that it is the first explicit reference to this figure I have encountered in Tibetan Buddhist sources. Are there any other materials that you may know of that align him with the Svarodaya - whether in its Śaivaite or Buddhist guises - or that seem to suggest knowledge of the Svarodaya on his part?

with thanks in advance,
Matthew
