Hi Jim,

The older Vedic references to चत्वारि वाक् परिमिता पदानि have been
continuously reinterpreted. चत्वारि पदजातानि नामाख्यातोपसर्गनिपाता: is an
explanation that we see in pre-Bhartr̥hari sources. With Bhartr̥hari begins
the expansion into पश्यन्ती, मध्यमा and वैखरी to which परा gets added at
some point. You have raised an interesting question about the origin of the
word वैखरी, if it is a Sanskritized Prakrit word.  The Sanskrit verb
विकिरति seems to appear as बिखरना in Hindi and विखरणे in Marathi. I don't
know how far back in Prakrit this can be attested. But looking at the word
वैखरी, I would not be surprised if it has a Prakrit origin.
