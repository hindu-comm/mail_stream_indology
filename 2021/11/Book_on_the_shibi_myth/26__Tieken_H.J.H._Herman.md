Dear List members,

I am searching for a particular publication on the Śibi myth. I am interested in it in connection with the Cōḻa dynastic history. I remember having seen announced sometime back a book on Śibi similar to, for instance, Adalbert Gail's Paraśurāma. Brahmane und Krieger (Harrassowitz). If it exists, I can't trace it. So perhaps my memory is playing tricks on me. I hope someone on the list can enlighten me (on the book or the state of my memory).

With kind regards, Herman
