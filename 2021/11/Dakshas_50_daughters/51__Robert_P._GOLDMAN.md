Dear François. 

At Vālmīkirāmāyaṇa (criticism. ed.) 3.13.10 ff. Jaṭāyus tells Rāma the history of Dakṣa’s sixty (not fifty or sixteen)  daughters. Eight of  them, who become the wives of Kaśyapa are named   and, Jaṭāyus says that they became, respectively, the mothers of various gods and daityas as well as various species of animals.
