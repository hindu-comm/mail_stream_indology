Dear colleagues

I would like to share details of my recently published monograph. Please consider recommending to your libraries:

Rethinking ‘Classical Yoga’ and Buddhism: Meditation, Metaphors and Materiality (2021)

Bloomsbury Advances in Religious Studies, Bloomsbury Publishing


This monograph employs conceptual metaphor theory to investigate

philosophy of mind and the materiality of Hindu and Buddhist

meditation systems in three 4th-5th-century CE Sanskrit meditation

treatises: the Pātañjalayogaśāstra, the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya and

the Yogācārabhūmiśāstra. The book also challenges the colonial historical

framing of these and other religio-philosophical texts as 'classical'

and considers how emic labels from South Asian culture can provide
more appropriate and useful categorisations.

There is also an online book launch discussion on November 12th, details of which can be found here: https://bit.ly/3mRcM4f
