Dear Colleagues,

the sad news has just reached me that Professor Minoru Hara  (emer., U. Tokyo) has passed away on Nov.1. He was 91.

We will keep him, and his work, in our memory for long.

I have known him since we first met in Tokyo in 1973, many times since, and last time four years ago when he graciously took the trouble to travel all across Tokyo for my lecture.

 If you want to write to his family, his address (no email known) is:

Minoru Hara
1-19-1-201 Ishikawa-cho
Ota-ku
Tokyo 145-0061
Japan



With regards,

Michael Witzel
