Dear list members,

I encountered this half stanza:

> viyogī vātha yogī vā advaitāpattim icchati

and could not find a specific source for it.
Of course it could be one of those sayings that just float around, but if
anyone should have a suggestion about a (likely) source, I would be happy
to hear it.

All the best,
Gaia Pintucci
