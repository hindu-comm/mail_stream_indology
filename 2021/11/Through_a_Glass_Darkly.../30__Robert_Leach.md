Dear list members,

I'd be very grateful if someone can share with me a soft copy of Hans
Henrich Hock's chapter "Through a Glass Darkly: Modern 'Racial'
Interpretations vs Textual and General Prehistoric Evidence on *ārya *and
*dāsa*/*dasyu *in Vedic Society" from the 1999 Bronkhorst & Deshpande
volume *Aryan and Non-Aryan in South Asia.*

Many thanks!

Robert
