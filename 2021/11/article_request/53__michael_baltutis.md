Greetings All,
Would anybody on this list have a copy of the following article that they might gracious share a PDF of?
Arjyāla Jñavāli, Sūrya Bikram."Pārivārik Vaṁśāvali-Arjyāl Thar ko." Rolamba 3.3 (1983)

The only library in the US that apparently has a copy of it is the Center for Research Libraries in Chicago, but my library at UW Oshkosh is not a member of their club and understandably won't pay the $175 they want for it. Thank you for any assistance.

Best,Michael
