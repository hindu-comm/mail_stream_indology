The way I typically use it is to run the splitter on a chunk (e.g. verse or paragraph) I'm interested in, use the swap buttons to change output to input, manually truncate/change any words I know won't be found in the dictionary otherwise (e.g., arthaiḥ > artha, buddhyā > buddhi), and then generate the list of links. I find it a nice help when I'm reading.
