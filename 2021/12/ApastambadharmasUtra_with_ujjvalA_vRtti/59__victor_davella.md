Dear all,

I am hoping that someone might be able to help me with an edition of the
Āpastamba Dharmasūtra with Haradatta's Ujjvalā Vṛtti. In particular, I need
the edition cited in Olivelle 2011, p. 395 (Cultural, Historical and
Textual Studies):

Āpastamba Dharmasūtra. Ed. with Haradatta’s commentary Ujjvalā by
U. C. Pandeya. Kashi Sanskrit Series, 93. Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit
Series Office, 1969.

I've been able to consult three other editions:

the Kumbakonam edition of 1895 ed. by Halasyanatha Sastry

the Mysore edition of 1898 ed. by Mahādeva Śāstri and K. Rangāchārya

the Kashi edition of 1932 ed. by Ramanatha Śastri

But none of them give a reading quoted on p. 304 of Olivelle's publication,
namely, ad Āp 2.7.7: prāyeṇocchabdaṃ śiṣṭā na paṭhanti. In the editions at
my disposal the word śiṣṭā is omitted.

Thanks and happy holidays!

All the Best,
Victor
