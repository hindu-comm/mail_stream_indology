I have not been able to download this article from JSTOR. Iâ€™d very much appreciate if someone can share an electronic version of it.

Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, ANTIQUARIAN INTERESTS IN MEDIEVAL INDIA: THE RELOCATION OF ASHOKAN PILLARS BY FIRUZSHAH TUGHLUQ, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 70 (2009-2010)<https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40173380>, pp. 994-1010

With thanks,

Patrick
