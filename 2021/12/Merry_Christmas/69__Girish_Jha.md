Dear  Professor Boudon,
Thank you very much for your kind email.I prayed to Lord Christ and posted
it to the Indology forum.It was all whatever I realised in my heart.I
thought this  is the ultimate reality.At the spiritual level there is no
difference which we all understand but unfortunately the whole world is
suffering from the deep distress.Through ourselves the message of religious
scriptures-"God is one who is alone our greatest lover and protector"can be
spread among the human beings and this may result in the welfare of the
entire human society.
I am very pleased that you had
 a perusal of my heart-felt shlokas and appreciated it too.The  scriptures
of all religions are our treasurehouse of divine  knowledge.
As to some strange words I found.Five days back I posted a request on both
fora:1.Indology and 2.Bharatiya vidvat parishat for giving me the soft copy
of a book titled Bhusana sara-Parama laghu manjushayoh siddhantanam
samiksha(in sanskrit) published by Sampurnananda Sanskrit
Univ.,Varanasi.But nobody replied
which indicated that it is not  avalilable in soft copy.Five days later I
received the message in red ink"follow up? dismiss."
I have also complained to the Google team.
Kindest regards
Girish K.Jha
