Dear Harry,
   The O - Sanskrit CR (pronounced "Seer") also does a tolerably good job
--so you can clean up the output by replacing its umlauts with macrons, its
cedillas with dots, etc., as global replacements.  (Just as Diego
suggested.)
   BTW,  S. Veṅkaṭarāma Śāstri's English translation of the Bālarāmāyaṇa is
now available on archive.org
Best wishes,
Tim Cahill
