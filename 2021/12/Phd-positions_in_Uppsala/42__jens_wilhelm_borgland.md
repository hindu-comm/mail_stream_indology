Dear list members,

the faculty of theology at Uppsala university has announced 7 phd
fellowships. The fellowships are funded for four years. Applications can be
made to any one of the disciplines at the department, one of which is
History of Religions. I would very much encourage applicants with projects
on Indian religions to apply, and would be grateful if you could spread the
word to potential applicants.

The announcement can be found here:

Best,
Jens

Jens W. Borgland
Associate Professor, History of Religions
