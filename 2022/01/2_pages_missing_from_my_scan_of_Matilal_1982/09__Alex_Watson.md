Dear All

Pages 136 and 137 are missing from a scan I have of Bimal Matilal's
'Necessity and Indian Logic', which is chapter 7 of his (1982)
*Logical and Ethical Issues of Religious Belief,*
(a write-up of his Stephanos Nirmalendu Ghosh Lectures on Comparative
Religion,
given in 1978).

Might anyone be able to send me a scan of those missing pages??

Yours Alex
