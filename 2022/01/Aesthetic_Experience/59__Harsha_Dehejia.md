Friends/Rasikas:

In the Indian tradition, as you all know, we can elevate aesthetic experience to a transcendent level and therefore we are able to say
brahmananda sahoadara.

Is Greek/European aesthetics able to do that or does it stop at a  psychological level of catharsis?

Kind regards,

Harsha
