Ear-piercing is an age-old tradition in South India and Sri Lanka, which is practiced even now. 

Elongating ear lobes IS also a practice in some ethnic groups in South India. It is NOT for renunciation. 

The earliest literary attestation we have is from porunarāRRuppadai (பொருநராற்றுப்படை) where a dancing woman (in a group of wandering bards) is described as having elongated ear lobes; her ears are compared to the handle of a scissors. I may not be using the right term, sorry. 

So … I think it must have been a pan-indic practice to grow long ear lobes.

Regards,
rajam
