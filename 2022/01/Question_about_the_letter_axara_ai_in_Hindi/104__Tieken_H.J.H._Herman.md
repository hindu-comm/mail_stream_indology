Dear List members,

I am looking for information about the letter (akṣara) ai in Hindi: does it represent the long vowel (/ǣ/) or the short one (/æ/)? The word I have in mind is baiṅk in yunāiṭeḍ baiṅk o.ph iṃdiyā (United Bank of India). In English a in bank is short, but in Skt, to which my knowledge is restricted, the akṣara ai is long.

With kind regards, Herman
