Dear list members,

I am currently working on older Telugu inscriptions.
So far my attempts to find anyone who is working in this field were
unfortunately not successful.
Hence I am now turning to this list to ask the broader Indological
community.

If you know of anyone who is dealing with Telugu inscriptions I would be
very grateful for a hint.


Best wishes for a happy New Year,

Jens Thomas
