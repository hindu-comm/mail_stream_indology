Thanks for sharing this.  It’s truly dismaying to see the world’s “two greatest democracies “ — India and the US — submerged by floods of sheer idiocy.

Subject: [INDOLOGY] "The Age of the Unicorn, Brought to You by IIT Kharagpur"

[FYI: this is related to these other recent developments from the same institute on the same topic:

  *   IIT-Kharagpur calendar calls Aryan invasion a myth<https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iit-calendar-on-aryan-invasion-myth-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-professor/article38065010.ece>

  *   With IIT Kharagpur Calendar, the Hindutva Right Takes Another Step Away From Science<https://m.thewire.in/article/education/with-iit-kharagpur-calendar-the-hindutva-right-takes-another-step-away-from-science>   ]

==Excerpts====

  *   The unicorn as a symbol of a Vedic rishi is among the four “decisive evidences” the sages of IIT Kharagpur have presented in a 2022 calendar, whose stated purpose is to rebut the “Aryan invasion myth”.

  *   The calendar has been produced under the auspices of the newly inaugurated Centre of Excellence for Indian Knowledge Systems at IIT Kharagpur, headed by Prof. Joy Sen.

  *   Even though this calendar has thrust IIT Kharagpur into the news, the so-called “Indian Knowledge Systems” already have a home in IIT Gandhinagar, and IIT Kanpur may be next in line.
