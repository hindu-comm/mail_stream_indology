As Sri Suresh mentioned, this is a euphemism.

In Telugu, in the case of rice and other food grains and auspices things
like kumkum, euphemism for 'exhausted' is 'full' or 'became/filled full'

'Poornam' in Sanskrit is considered to be standing for zero.

Pujyam for zero /s'unyam seems to be on the same lines.
