Dear members of the community, I'm posting this for a friend. If anyone can
help with the texts, please let her know at hagar.shalev at mail.huji.ac.il.

Here is what Hagar writes:

Dear members of Indology,

I am trying to get hold of two early modern yogic texts:
Upāsanāsārasaṅgraha (16th c.) and Rājatarala (late 18th c.), a commentary
on the Yogatārāvalī. I am interested in both mss and e-texts - whatever is
available.


Thank you all!

Sivan.
