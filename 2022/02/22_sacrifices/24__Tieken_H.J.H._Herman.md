Dear List members,
In Puṟanāṉūṟu 166 a brahmin is described who had "performed to perfection all twenty-one kinds of sacrifices" (trsl. Hart and Heifetz). I am at a loss which 22 sacrifices are referred to here; that is to say, I do not know where to look. I hope someone has a suggestion.
With kind regards, Herman
