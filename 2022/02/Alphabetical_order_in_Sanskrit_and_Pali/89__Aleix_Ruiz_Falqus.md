Dear list,

I am looking for scholarly publications on the criteria for the sequential
order of the akṣaras in Sanskrit and Pali. I am also interested in knowing
if anyone has come across the concepts of kāla (= long, short, etc.) and
śruti (voiced, unvoiced, etc.) in relation to the categorisation of akṣaras
in Sanskrit śāstras. Especially the concept of kālaśrutibheda, which is
what distinguishes sounds generated in the same place of articulation.

Any help will be most appreciated.

Best wishes,
Aleix
