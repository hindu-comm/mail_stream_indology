The book by Gonda is his Change and continuity in Indian religion, with an article ‘The number sixteen.’ As I remember well he also discusses other numbers.
Does anyone have a pdf of this.?

Also I was given this reference offlist which looks very promising. Does anyone have a pdf of:
Lucky Numbers in Ancient Indian Literature by Siegfried Lienhard.
Its in:
Veroffentlichungen der Glasenapp-Stiftung 44
Siegfried Lienhard: Kleine Schriften
Edited by Oskar von Hinuber, 2008
page 159-173
and in:
Langue, style et structure dans le monde Indian, Paris, 1996, 523-536

Harry Spier
