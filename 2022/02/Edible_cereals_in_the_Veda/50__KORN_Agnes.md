Dear all,

Adam Hyllested has been working on cereals as well. There is a paper from 2020 by him
https://nors.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en%2Fpublications%2Fdid-protoindoeuropean-have-a-word-for-wheat-hittite-eppitt-revisited-and-the-rise-of-postpie-cereal-terminology(05e2a870-ab9d-4e0d-b136-ad63288c3526).html
and you could ask him about his subsequent (2021) presentation, where he elaborated further on the topic.

Best,
Agnes

Dear François,

There is a recent article by Martin Joachim Kümmel: Agricultural terms in Indo-Iranian. It was published as chapter 12 in Language dispersal beyond farming, ed. by Martine Robbeets and Alexander Savelyev, John Benjamins Publishing, 2017.

The attached is a copy of the handout, available from Research Gate.

I hope this helps.

Best wishes,

Hans Henrich

Dear All,

Is there any comprehensive and up-to-date study on the edible cereals in the Veda: vrIhi, yava, godhUma, priaGgu, etc.?

If so, can someone send me copies of this/these study/ies?

Thanks in advance.

François Voegeli
