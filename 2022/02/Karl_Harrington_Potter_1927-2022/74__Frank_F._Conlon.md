Dear Colleagues:

The following obituary for Karl Potter has been posted on H-Asia. I thought it might reach some others who knew Karl on the Indology list. Note the zoom memorial session this coming Sunday.

Karl Harrington Potter (19 August 1927 – 11 January 2022)



It is my sad duty to report the passing of Karl Harrington Potter, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy and South Asian Studies at the University of Washington on January 11, 2022 in Bothell, WA. He was a universally recognized and respected scholar on the philosophical systems of India.  Author of numerous articles, he published Presuppositions of Indian Philosophies (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1963 and later reprints) and, with Austin Creel and Edwin Gerow, Guide to Indian Philosophy (Boston: G. K. Hall, 1998). However his greatest contribution may be his Encylopedia of Indian Philosophies, a project upon which Karl labored for over forty years serving as general editor and contributor. The 25 volumes were published between 1970 and 2019 (Publication details are appended at the conclusion of this obituary.

Born 19 August 1927 in Oakland, CA, he was son of George Reuben Potter, a Professor of English at the University of California, Berkeley and Mabel Harrington Potter, a pianist.  Karl was named after his maternal grandfather Karl Pomeroy Harrington, a distinguished professor of Classics at Wesleyan University. After attending the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, Karl completed his B.A. at Berkeley in 1950. After a year of study in India in 1952-53, he completed his PhD under Daniel Ingalls at Harvard in 1955.

That year Karl joined the Philosophy faculty at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota where he met Antonia Fleak whom he married in 1957. From 1956 he served at the University of Minnesota teaching analytical philosophy and introducing courses on the philosophies of India. He also played a major role in the formation of  the South Asian studies program at Minnesota before joining the University of Washington in 1971. Along with his continued teaching in Philosophy, Karl led the growth of the Washington South Asia program, serving many years as its director. Grounded in his scholarly focus, he also was an active promotor and participant in significant inter-disciplinary projects such as that on Karma and Rebirth sponsored by the Joint Committee on South Asia of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies. He retired in from Washington in 1997 but continued his active scholarly endeavors toward completion of the Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies.  In recognition of his great contributions to this project he was celebrated by the Government of India which bestowed upon him the Padma Shri award in 2011.

Beyond his own extensive scholarly publications, Karl was active nationally and internationally in the scholarly study of philosophy and South Asia.  He contributed service to scholarly organizations such as the Association for Asian Studies and the American Institute of Indian Studies. For many years he chaired the South Asia Review panel for the Fulbright Senior Scholar Awards.

I first met Karl when I was a graduate student at the University of Minnesota in 1961 when he and his wife Toni joined our first year Hindi class.  Later I had a chance to enroll in his Introduction to Indian Philosophy course—a most rigorous and enlightening experience.  I was delighted when he joined us at Washington, and benefited enormously from his leadership and support.  I am staggered to realize that we first met 61 years ago.

Karl Potter was an intellectual giant of great discipline and organizational capacities. Yet personally he was unfailingly “low key”—personable, empathetic and welcoming. He was a wonderful colleague. He and Toni opened their home for myriad meals and social gatherings for faculty and students. Beyond his family Karl loved wilderness hiking, golf, chess and classical music.  He introduced many of us to the compositions of Franz Schmidt whose music he rightly felt to be underappreciated.  Perhaps stemming from his mother’s artistry he was a skilled pianist. In some ways it is difficult to comprehend how all that Karl accomplished could fit into one lifetime..

He is survived by his wife Antonia, their children David and Julie, grandson Raphael and sister Nancy.  He was predeceased by his brother, the political scientist David Potter. His family have suggested donations in his memory to Sequoia Forest Keeper: (https:/www.patagonia.com/actionworks.grantees/Sequoia-forestkeeper/)

A virtual Zoom memorial for Karl Potter will be held on Sunday, February 13 at 11:00 am (Pacific Standard Time/ 19:00 GMT/12:30 IST). It is anticipated that it will last about one hour.
