Hello Martin,

even if a concept with an Arabic-language term is hidden behind that, it is
by no means certain that the author also understood it in Arabic (unless he
was an expert). He could well have associated something Persian with this
wording (tājikabhāṣāyāṃ!) and made up a vague meaning, which he then simply
translated literally into Sanskrit. Anyway, I would rather understand it as
Karmadhāraya, i.e. as a kind of "subtle sweetness". In any case, it is
striking that saha-masāda could perhaps conceal a truncated Persian مازه
māzah/māze ("taste") as well as a truncated Persian سهل sahl ("soft,
easy"). The Persian experts on this list will be able to judge this
immediately.
Suppose this were possible, the sentence could come to mean that in the
Tajik language, a wording like saha-masāda (~ ~ "soft taste") is the
equivalent of sūkṣma-svādu ("subtle sweetness").

So much for my amateurish guesswork.

Best wishes,
Walter
