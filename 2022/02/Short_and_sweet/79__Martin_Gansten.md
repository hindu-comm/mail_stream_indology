Thanks for all suggestions so far, and especially to Walter and Dan for 
their thoughts on the Persian and Arabic possibilities. Perhaps I should 
have given a little more background; let me do so now.

The Sanskrit author is Samarasiṃha 
<https://doi.org/10.1163/25425552-12340005>, and the verse occurs in his 
Pṛcchoddeśa (more commonly known among later authors simply as 
Samarasiṃhatājika or -śāstra, with variants). That text is an abridged 
Sanskrit version of several Arabic works on astrology, primarily by Sahl 
ibn Bishr; the Sanskrit title is probably meant as a free translation of 
Kitāb fi l-masāʾil wa-l-aḥkām ('Book on questions and judgements'). So 
Samarasiṃha did know Arabic quite well, which seems to preclude the 
otherwise very attractive possibility of a 'creative misunderstanding' 
suggested by Walter.

The technical term sahm in Arabic-language astrology is a calque of the 
Greek κλῆρος 'lot' (as in casting lots); the phrase sahm as-saʿāda 
translates κλῆρος τῆς τύχης 'lot of fortune' (often semi-Sanskritized as 
puṇya-sahama). Astrological lots are mathematically derived points on 
the ecliptic signifying various things, from the fairly abstract (e.g., 
fortune) to the very concrete and specific (e.g., camels ). The chapter 
from which the line in question was taken goes on to discuss 48 such 
'sahamāni', using that term repeatedly.

I didn't give the full verse because it is corrupt (so far I have seen 
only a single MS of the text): the scribe seems to have mixed up two 
verses, so that the sentence is incomplete, which makes it even more of 
a challenge to make sense of the sūkṣmasvāduḥ (or, indeed, sūkṣmaḥ 
svāduś ca). Perhaps the missing bit would have explained it! I just 
wondered whether this were a set phrase that I was unaware of. Perhaps 
Samarasiṃha just meant to express his appreciation of the mellifluous 
quality of the 'Tājika language' is general, and/or the phrase sahm 
as-saʿāda in particular?

Best wishes,
Martin
