Dear Colleagues

I have now attempted to make a Dropbox link to Before and After pictures of the thangka. I am also happy to send photos to anyone who is interested. Thank you to those of you who have already been in touch.

Sullivan’s Chinese collection is now in the Ashmolean, but it appears that the museum wasn’t interested in this work. The silk mount was in very poor condition, but my friend has had it remounted in traditional style, and wishes to donate it to a Buddhist centre we’re both associated with. So naturally we would like to know what is going on.

The monks’ robes, apparently featuring a black inner robe, don’t seem to belong to any of the current Tibetan orders.
