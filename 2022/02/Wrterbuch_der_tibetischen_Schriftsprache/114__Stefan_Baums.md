Dear friends and colleagues,

I have been asked to forward the announcement below.

All best,
Stefan Baums

------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear colleagues,

the Wörterbuch der tibetischen Schriftsprache (Dictionary of Literary
Tibetan) is now available online:

http://wts-digital.badw.de

This portal is available in open access. It has been tested with
Firefox and MS Edge, but should also be accessible with other
browsers. The portal allows one to search in the previously published
fascicles up to and including the basic letter N. For the time being,
the entries in the older volumes (K to TH) are displayed as relevant
pages from the printed fascicles.

The project's website has also been redesigned, and now includes an English version:

http://www.wts.badw.de

With kind regards,

the editors and contributors
of the Wörterbuch der tibetischen Schriftsprache
Bavarian Academy of Sciences, Munich
