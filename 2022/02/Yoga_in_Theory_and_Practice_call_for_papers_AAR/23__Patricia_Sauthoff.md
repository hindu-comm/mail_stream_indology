Dear colleagues,

I am forwarding you this year's CFP for the Yoga in Theory and Practice
unit of the AAR. For the 2022 Annual Meeting, we especially invite
proposals on the following topics. Please contact the organizing scholar
listed next to each topic for more information:


   - Yoga therapy, healthcare, and trauma (Contact: Christa Kuberry,
   christakuberry at gmail.com)
   - Yoga and psychedelics (Contact: Stuart Sarbacker,
   stuart.sarbacker at oregonstate.edu)
   - Tibetan yoga (Contact: Naomi Worth, nw3ca at virginia.edu)
   - Yoga Bindu, especially as a point of interface between Buddhism,
   Jainism, Hinduism, etc. (Contact: Christopher Chapple,
   christopher.chapple at lmu.edu)
   - Hindu-Christian relations and Christian-based yoga (Contact: Allyson
   Huval, allysonhuval at gmail.com)
   - A co-sponsored session between Yoga in Theory and Practice and Sikh
   Studies invites presentations that explore the relationship between Sikhi
   and Yogathrough a variety of approaches that may engage topics such as
   colonization, oral and textual knowledge production, lineage transmission,
   hermeneutics, issues of appropriation and abuse, historical figures and
   communities related to Sikhi and Yoga. (Contact: Nirinjan Khalsa,
   Nirinjan.Khalsa at lmu.edu and Christopher Miller,

We are also open to full-panel proposals on any other topic falling under
the purview of Yoga Studies.
