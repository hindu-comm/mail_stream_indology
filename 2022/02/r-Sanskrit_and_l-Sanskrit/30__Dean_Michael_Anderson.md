I had read somewhere that there are two dialects of Sanskrit that tend to use either the 'r' sound or the 'l' sound and that they appear to be geographically separated.
I've forgotten who pointed this out although my faulty memory is suggesting Emeneau.
Can anyone provide me with more information about this?
Best,
Dean
