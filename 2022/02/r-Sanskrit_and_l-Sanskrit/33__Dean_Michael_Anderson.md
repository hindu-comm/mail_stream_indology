 Thanks to everyone for replying. Yes, Burrow sounds right.
Madhav, could you point me to your own work on this, please?
Best,
Dean

 Dear Dean,
  This theory is detailed by Thomas Burrow in his article "The Proto-Indo-Aryans." I have discussed Burrow's idea in some of my own work.

I had read somewhere that there are two dialects of Sanskrit that tend to use either the 'r' sound or the 'l' sound and that they appear to be geographically separated.
I've forgotten who pointed this out although my faulty memory is suggesting Emeneau.
Can anyone provide me with more information about this?
Best,
Dean
