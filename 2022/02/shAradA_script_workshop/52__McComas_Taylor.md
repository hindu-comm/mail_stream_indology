Dear Colleagues,

We are running a free online workshop for reading, writing and transliterating Śāradā script. This script was used Kashmir from the 3rd-12 centuries CE, and is important especially for Kashmiri Śaivism. The course will be taught by Rakesh Koul and Veronica Peer, Tues-Wed-Thurs, 15-16-17 Feb, 7.30-9.00pm, Canberra time. Please distribute this link among anyone who might be interested:

Thanks in advance,

McComas
