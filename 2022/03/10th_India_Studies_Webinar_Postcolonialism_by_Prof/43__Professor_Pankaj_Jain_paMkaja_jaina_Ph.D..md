The formulation and effect of Postcolonialism were widely different in
different locations - in the US academy where it began, in the White
Commonwealth where it was embraced, and in India where it was resisted.
This webinar traces the trajectory from the pre-Postcolonial to the
post-Postcolonial. It focuses in particular on four Indian/para-Indian case
studies: Phanishwar Nath "Renu", who was one of the first writers to depict
post-Independence disillusionment in India, V. S. Naipaul, who sought to
break free of the old colonial burden, Salman Rushdie who was the
poster-boy of the Postcolonial writers (as distinct from its celebrity
theorists), and Taslima Nasreen, the postcolonial writer virtually brushed
under the ideological carpet.

Thanks and regards,
