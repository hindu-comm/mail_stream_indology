Dear friends and colleagues,

I was looking for Dumont’s L’Aśvamedha. Description du sacrifice solennel du cheval [etc.] (1927), but I found out that no Italian library owns a copy of the volume. Then, assuming that the work is no longer protected by copyright, I looked for a soft copy of the volume: to my surprise, I could not find it in Archive.org nor in Gallica nor anywhere else. Am I missing something? Can somebody illuminate me?

Thank you in advance for your help.
Best wishes,

Marco
