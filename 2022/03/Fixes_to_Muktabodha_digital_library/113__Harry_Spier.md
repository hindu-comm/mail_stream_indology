Dear list members,

Dr. S. A. S. Sarma of the EFEO Pondicherry pointed out some dead links to
manuscript and publication facsimiles in the Muktabodha digital library.
These have now been fixed.
The texts whose links have now been fixed are:

pratyabhijñahṛdaya
śivapūjāviṣāyasūcī
śivabhaktamahātmya
śaivasaṃnyāsapaddhati
śaivasiddhāntiparibhāṣā

In addition, links to the following vedic manuscript photographic
facsimiles are no longer available in the Muktabodha e-text collection
since they are also in Muktabodha's  Vedic manuscripts of Gokarna
collection.
