Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] YogVashishthaSara

As far as I know, all the Yogavāsiṣṭhas (including the Sāra and Laghu) are considered to be 'Rāmāyaṇas' and as such are ascribed to Vālmīki (the same way as the Mahābhārata is traditionally ascribed to Vyāsa).

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] YogVashishthaSara


There are two articles of comparatively recent origin which deal with this subject in desirable detail:
1) 
Stinner, Susanne: Sāras, Saṃgrahas und 'Laghus': Kurzfassungen des 
Mokṣopāya, in: The Mokṣopāya, Yogavāsiṣṭha and related texts: (based on 
revised versions of lectures delivered at the "Mokṣopāya Panel" held at 
the 29th German Oriental Conference in Halle), ed. by Jürgen Hanneder. 
Aachen, 2005, S. 91-104.


2) 
Hanneder, Jürgen: The Mokṣopāyasaṅgraha, in: The Mokṣopāya, Yogavāsiṣṭha
 and related texts: (based on revised versions of lectures delivered at 
the "Mokṣopāya Panel" held at the 29th German Oriental Conference in 
Halle), ed. by Jürgen Hanneder. Aachen, 2005, S. 105-112.



Kind regards,Walter Slaje

Respected Scholars ,Can anyone enlighten me on the authorship or the compiler of the text " YogVashishthaSara", which happens to be a set of preachings rendered
by Sage Vashishtha to his pupil Lord Rama.It is a compendium of interpretations ofAdwaitya Vedanta( Absolute Monism).Regards.Alakendu Das.
