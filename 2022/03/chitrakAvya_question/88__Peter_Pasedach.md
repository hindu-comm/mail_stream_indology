Dear all,

the 48th canto of the Haravijaya, one of two called  
“Citrayuddhavarṇanam” in it, contains three verses in which different  
variants of a technique called Niravadya are applied:

gabhīradhīrāravarīṇabhīruraṇādarā dāruṇavāraṇā sā |
abhaṅgurā vīravirūḍhahāvasurāṅganādakṣakaṭākṣamokṣaiḥ || 51 ||  
(pādaniravadyaḥ)
prabhāmayenāricamūs tadānīṃ salīlam āsphālitacāpayaṣṭiḥ |
virūḍhasaṃrambhasurāribāṇasaṃbhārasaṃruddhakarīrakuñjā || 52 ||  
(prāgardhaniravadyaḥ)
ārūḍharīḍhāmarabāṇaviddhaturaṃgamālā raṇarāgamūḍhā |
nītā vihastatvabhibhaiḥ sahātha suvarṇasānor gahanāny avikṣat || 13 ||  
(caramārdhaniravadyaḥ)

V. Balasubramaniam lists these in his Citram book (2007, vol. I, p.  
313f.), but unfortunately without explaining the restriction. I have  
not yet found any other instances of this technique being used. Is  
anybody familiar with this technique, or can spot a pattern, and could  
explain what is the “blameless” element in these stanzas?

Best wishes

Peter Pasedach
