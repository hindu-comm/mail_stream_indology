I received this response from a scholar Dr Shankar Rajaraman:

to me
Namaste
निरवद्य here seems to refer to the use of purely संस्कृत words which do not
retain the same form in प्राकृत.
Verse 51 is पादनिरवद्य since, except the last पाद
(सुराङ्गनादक्षकटाक्षमोक्षैः), all the remaining 3 पादs -
(गभीरधीरारवरीणभीरु) (रणादरा दारुणवारणा सा) (अभङ्गुरा वीरविरूढहाव) are
composed of संस्कृत words that retain the same form in प्राकृत.
Verse 52 is प्रागर्धनिरवद्य because, in contrast to its first half, the
second half (उत्तरार्ध) - विरूढसंरंम्भसुरारिबाणसंभारसंरुद्धकरीरकुंजा - is
again composed of संस्कृत words that retain the same form in प्राकृत. The
first half, in that sense, has pure संस्कृत forms (which, if rendered by
their respective प्राकृत equivalents, will undergo a morphological
transformation that will alter them substantially from those Sanskrit
forms).
Verse 53 is चरमार्धनिरवद्य because, in contrast to its second half, the
first half - आरूढरीढामरबाणविद्धतुरंगमाला रणरागमूढा - in a way similar to
the one described above, is composed of संस्कृत words that retain the same
form in प्राकृत. The second half, in this case, is therefore conposed of
"pure" Sanskrit forms and therefore निरवद्य
Thank you
