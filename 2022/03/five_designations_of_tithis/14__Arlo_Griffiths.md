Dear Martin, Agathe and Bill,

Thanks a lot for your quick and helpful responses! The Bṛhatsaṃhitā reference is precisely the kind of source I was looking for.

Best wishes,

Arlo

Subject: Re: [INDOLOGY] five designations of tithis

Dear Arlo,

The cycle of five tithis is given in Bṛhatsaṃhitā 98.1-2 (3rd tithi vijayā instead of jayā). This system is likely based on an older system of 15 tithis attested in the Gārgīyajyotiṣa as discussed in my paper.

Mak, Bill. 2018. ‘Tithikarmaguṇa in Gārgīyajyotiṣa – Tithi Worship According to a Number of Early Sources’. Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies 66 (3): 958–91.

Best regards,

Bill

Dear colleagues,

In Louis-Charles Damais' study “Études d’épigraphie indonésienne, IV: Discussion de la date des inscriptions” (Bulletin de l’École française d’Extrême-Orient 47 (1) [https://doi.org/10.3406/befeo.1955.5406], p. 70 n. 1) one reads about "cinq qualifications des tithi". According to the author, there are five such designations for tithis, i.e.

- Nandā (tithi # 1, 6 and 11 waxing or waning)
- Вhadrā (tithi # 2, 7 and 12 waxing or waning)
- Jayā (tithi # 3, 8 and 13 waxing or waning)
- Riktā (tithi # 4, 9 et 14 waxing or waning)
- Pūrṇā (tithi # 5, 10 and 15 waxing or waning)

He cites (11th-c.) Javanese epigraphical occurrences of three of these designations, but does not cite his source for the whole system.

Does it have its origin in Indian jyotiḥśāstra? I'd be grateful for references.

Best wishes,

Arlo Griffiths
