Hi,

Is there anywhere an index of the Upaniṣadic passages quoted by Śaṅkarācārya in his major works?  Of course, he comments fully on 10 Upaniṣads, but in these commentaries he makes reference to passages from other Upaniṣads in passing. I’m trying to get an idea of his favorite passages, those upon which he may most rely.

Thanks for any help here.
