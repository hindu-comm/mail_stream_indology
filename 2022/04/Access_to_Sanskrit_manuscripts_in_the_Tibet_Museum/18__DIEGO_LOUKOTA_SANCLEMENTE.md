  Dear David,

  The short answer is, as far as I know, no. They are zealously guarded and
the last I knew is that they will be for the foreseeable future. Ernst
Steinkellner managed to form a liaison in the 90s and published a few
things, but my impression is that otherwise they are permanently off
limits, to Chinese and non-Chinese scholars alike. If things have changed,
I would urge anyone who knows the current situation to update us.
  I think you may have better luck with the photos Tucci and Sankrtyayana
took, now in Göttingen and Naples.
  There is a complementary catalogue by Luo Zhao of the holdings of the
Potala and Norbulingka, of the MSS. that were never taken to the “Palace of
Nationalities” in Beijing. This circulates in xeroxes of the original
handwritten notebook.
  I hope this helps!

  namaskaromi,

  Diego
