Does anyone have a scan of the following catalogue, by chance?  It's #0522
in Biswas:

 *A succinct catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts in the possession of the
Faculty of Letters, Kyoto University*
compiled by Kiyotaka Goshima and Keiya Noguchi. -- Society for Indic and
Buddhistic Studies, Kyoto University, 1983.

If not, I'll order it on inter-library loan.

Best,
Dominik Wujastyk
