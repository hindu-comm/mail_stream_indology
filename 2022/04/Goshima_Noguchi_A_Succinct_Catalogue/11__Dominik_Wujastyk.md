I'm very grateful to Shayne Clarke for links to the new MS scans at Kyoto,
to Ronald Davidson for a supplementary list, and to Kenji Takahashi for a
scan of the 1983 catalogue itself.  I will add the information under Biswas
0522 at http://catalogues.indology.info

What a great resource this community is!

Best wishes,
Dominik
